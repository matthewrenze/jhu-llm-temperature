  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  They review exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be Kramer or O'Neill.
  If Megregian reviews fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez, then Megregian cannot review Undulation and the third student who reviews Undulation must be either Kramer or Lopez.
  If neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, then Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  
  A: If three students review Undulation, then Megregian must review Undulation since the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be Kramer or O'Neill. This statement is false.
  B: If three students review Undulation, then O'Neill must review Tamerlane since the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be Kramer or O'Neill. This statement is false.
  C: If three students review Undulation, then Jiang cannot be one of the three students since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This statement is true.
  D: If three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. This statement is true, but it does not provide any information about Lopez reviewing Tamerlane.
  E: If three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. This statement is false.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly three students review Undulation.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Only three plays are reviewed: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Analysis:
  - Since exactly three students review Undulation and there are only three plays, the other two students must have reviewed the same play or plays as each other.
  - From the given information, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane. Therefore, the other two students must have reviewed Sunset.
  - Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must have reviewed Sunset. 
  - Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must have reviewed all three plays.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Jiang reviews Undulation.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the two remaining students must review the same play or plays as each other. 
  A: If Megregian does not review Undulation, then he must be one of the two students who review the same play or plays as each other. However, this is not possible since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  B: If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then he must be one of the two students who review the same play or plays as each other. However, this is not possible since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  C: If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Megregian nor Lopez can review Undulation. This satisfies the given conditions.
  D: If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian and O'Neill must review Undulation, which is not possible since only three students review Undulation.
  E: If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer must review Undulation. This satisfies the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review one of the other two plays.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review one of the other two plays. 
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then he must review at least one other play. This would mean that either Lopez or Kramer, who each review fewer plays than Megregian, would have to review Undulation, which is not allowed. Therefore, Megregian cannot review Undulation.
  If O'Neill reviews Undulation, then he cannot review Tamerlane, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, O'Neill cannot review Undulation.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Megregian nor Lopez can review Undulation, which is allowed. Therefore, Jiang can review Undulation.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer must review Sunset, which means that two students (Kramer and O'Neill) review exactly the same play (Tamerlane). This contradicts the given information. Therefore, Lopez cannot review Tamerlane.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer must review Tamerlane, which means that two students (Kramer and O'Neill) review exactly the same play (Tamerlane). This is allowed. Therefore, O'Neill can review Sunset.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  5 students (J, K, L, M, O) review 1 or more of exactly 3 plays (S, T, U).
  K and L review fewer of the plays than M.
  Neither L nor M reviews any play J reviews.
  K and O both review T.
  Exactly 2 students review the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly 3 students review U, then the other 2 students must review S and T.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly 3 students review U, then the other 2 students must review S and T. 
  According to the information given, K and O both review T, so J, L, and M must review U and S.
  Neither L nor M reviews any play J reviews, so J cannot review U.
  Therefore, O'Neill must review U, and Megregian must review T.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  5 students reviewed 3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez < Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play Jiang reviewed.
  Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane.
  Exactly two students reviewed the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then only two students did not review Undulation. 
  Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, so they did not review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play Jiang reviewed, so Jiang reviewed Undulation.
  Since Kramer and Lopez each reviewed fewer plays than Megregian, Megregian must have reviewed Undulation.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three students review Undulation.
  - There are only three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Two students review the same play or plays as each other.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.

Solution:
  - If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review the same play or plays.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot review Undulation.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review Undulation.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, so Megregian must review Undulation.
  - Therefore, O'Neill and Lopez must review the same play or plays.
  
A: Megregian must review Undulation, so this cannot be true.
B: O'Neill cannot review Undulation, so this is true.
C: Jiang must review Undulation, so this is true.
D: Lopez cannot review Tamerlane, so this is false.
E: O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, so this is false.

Action: Answer("BC")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  5 students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Each student reviews one or more of the 3 plays, but not any other plays.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
  Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. Therefore, Jiang must review Sunset or Undulation.
  
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation. If Megregian does not review Undulation, then the three students who review Undulation are Kramer, Lopez, and Jiang. But Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, which means Megregian must review at least 2 plays. This contradicts the fact that each student reviews one or more of the 3 plays, but not any other plays. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then the three students who review Undulation are Kramer, Lopez, and Jiang. But Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, which means Megregian must review at least 2 plays. This contradicts the fact that each student reviews one or more of the 3 plays, but not any other plays. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation. If Jiang reviews Undulation, then the other two students who review Undulation are Kramer and Lopez. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Megregian cannot review Tamerlane. Therefore, Megregian must review Sunset. This satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, this could be true.
  
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer and O'Neill also review Tamerlane. But then, the only play left for the three students who did not review Tamerlane is Undulation. This means that Megregian, Lopez, and Kramer all review Undulation, which contradicts the fact that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then the three students who did not review Sunset are Megregian, Kramer, and Lopez. But Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, which means Megregian and Lopez must review Undulation. This satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, this could be true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly three of the students review Undulation.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  - If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must not have reviewed Undulation.
  - Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then the third student who reviewed Undulation must not have reviewed Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot be one of the three students who reviewed Undulation.
  - If O'Neill reviewed Sunset, then Megregian must have reviewed Undulation, which violates the condition that Kramer and Lopez each reviewed fewer plays than Megregian.
  - Therefore, O'Neill must have reviewed Undulation.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Five students in total review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  
If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane and Sunset. Therefore, we can eliminate options D and E.

Option A is possible since Megregian is not one of the three students reviewing Undulation. 

Option B is also possible since O'Neill could be one of the two students who review the same play as each other, and that play is Tamerlane. 

Option C is not possible since it violates the condition that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

For website targets:
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

For voicemail targets:
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: A 3-day voicemail target cannot be set for more than one of the clients because if two clients have a 3-day voicemail target, then the third client must have a voicemail target shorter than 3 days. However, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, which means that Image cannot have a 3-day voicemail target. Therefore, a 3-day voicemail target cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  
Analysis:
  A 1-day website target can be set for all clients.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all clients.
  A 2-day website target cannot be set for Solide because Truvest's website target must be shorter than Solide's website target.
  A 3-day voicemail target cannot be set for Image because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  A 3-day website target cannot be set for Truvest because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: A 2-day voicemail target cannot be set for more than one of the clients because each client has a different voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target cannot be 2 days. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so they cannot both have a 2-day website target. However, it is possible for more than one client to have a 1-day website target, a 2-day website target, a 3-day website target, or a 3-day voicemail target. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
  A 1-day website target can be set for all clients.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all clients.
  A 2-day website target can be set for Solide and Truvest, but not for Image because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for all clients.
  A 3-day website target can be set for Image and Solide, but not for Truvest because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("C")  
The target that CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients is a 2-day website target. It can only be set for Solide and Truvest, but not for Image because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The company sets two service targets for each client, one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The company sets two service targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  Based on these conditions, we need to determine which target cannot be set for more than one client.
  
Analysis:
  A 1-day website target can be set for Image, Solide, or Truvest.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for Image, Solide, or Truvest.
  A 2-day website target can be set for Solide or Truvest, but not for Image (because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets).
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for Image, Solide, or Truvest.
  A 3-day website target can be set for Image or Solide, but not for Truvest (because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target).
  
Conclusion:
  Only the 2-day website target (choice C) cannot be set for more than one of the clients (it can only be set for Solide or Truvest). Therefore, the answer is: Answer("C").
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  There are six targets in total, two for each client.
  The targets are for service response times and are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client - one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  A: A 1-day website target can be set for all three clients, but it is not specified that it cannot be set for more than one client.
  B: A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients, but it is not specified that it cannot be set for more than one client.
  C: A 2-day website target cannot be set for more than one client because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  D: A 3-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients, but it is not specified that it cannot be set for more than one client.
  E: A 3-day website target cannot be set for more than one client because None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Analysis:
  If a target is set for more than one client, it must meet the conditions for both clients.
  A 1-day website target can be set for both Solide and Truvest, since neither of them can have a website target longer than their voicemail target.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients.
  A 2-day website target cannot be set for both Solide and Truvest, since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for both Image and Solide, since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets and Solide's voicemail target can be set for up to 3 days.
  A 3-day website target can be set for Image, since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets and Image's website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Solution:
  The Flores Tower is the only class 1 building owned by any of the companies, so it cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings. 
  The Garza Tower is the only other class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings. 
  Therefore, the only way to trade buildings of different classes is to trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  The King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building are the only class 2 buildings, so each of them must be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp has only one class 1 building, and it cannot be traded for any of the class 2 buildings owned by the other companies, so it cannot make a trade with them.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings, and the only company that can make this trade is Trustcorp.
  Southco cannot make any trades with the other companies, as it has no class 2 or class 3 buildings to trade.
  The final buildings owned by the three companies after one trade is made are:
  RealProp: the Yates House and the Zimmer House
  Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building
  Trustcorp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building
  Answer: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns 3 buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  There are 3 types of trades that can be made: same class for same class, 1 class 1 for 2 class 2, and 1 class 2 for 2 class 3.
  
Analysis:
  To make a valid trade, one of the companies with a class 1 building would need to trade with Trustcorp, since they are the only company with class 2 buildings. 
  Since Trustcorp only has class 2 buildings, they cannot trade one building for two class 2 buildings, so they would need to trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only valid trade would be for RealProp to trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for two of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings (King Building and Ortiz Building). 
  After this trade, RealProp would own the Yates House and Zimmer House (both class 3), and Trustcorp would own the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Meyer Building (class 2) in addition to the King Building and Ortiz Building (both class 2).
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After only one trade is made, each company can only exchange one building with another company.
  
Analysis: 
  We need to find a possible combination of buildings that can be owned by RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp after only one trade. 
  RealProp has one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings. Therefore, RealProp can only trade the Garza Tower with Southco's Flores Tower, or trade the Garza Tower with Trustcorp's King Building or Ortiz Building. 
  Southco has one class 1 building and one class 2 building. Therefore, Southco can only trade the Flores Tower with RealProp's Garza Tower, or trade the Lynch Building with Trustcorp's King Building or Ortiz Building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp can only trade the King Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building with either RealProp or Southco.
  So, there are only a few possible combinations of buildings that can be owned by the three companies after only one trade.

Action: Answer("D")  
  Explanation: 
    RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) with Trustcorp's Meyer Building (class 2).
    Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) with Trustcorp's Ortiz Building and King Building (both class 3).
    So, after the trade, RealProp owns the Meyer Building (class 2), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). 
    Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the King Building (class 3), and the Ortiz Building (class 3).
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Analysis: 
  We need to find a set of trades that would result in each company owning buildings of different classes than before the trade. 
  The Yates House and Zimmer House are class 3 buildings, so they can only be traded for two class 2 buildings each. 
  The Garza Tower is a class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings. 
  The Flores Tower is a class 1 building, so it can only be traded for one other building of the same class.
  The King Building and Ortiz Building are class 2 buildings, so they can only be traded for two class 3 buildings each. 
  The Meyer Building is a class 2 building, so it can only be traded for two class 3 buildings. 
  We can eliminate options A, B, and D because they do not have the correct number of buildings in each class for each company after the trade. 
  Option C has the correct number of buildings in each class for each company after the trade, but the Garza Tower and Lynch Building cannot be traded for the buildings listed. 
  Option E has the correct number of buildings in each class for each company after the trade, and it is possible to trade the Garza Tower for the Lynch Building and the Flores Tower for the Yates House and Zimmer House. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  RealProp can trade its class 1 building (Garza Tower) for two class 2 buildings. 
  Southco can trade its class 1 building (Flores Tower) for two class 2 buildings or trade its class 2 building (Lynch Building) for two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp can trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.

  Option A: RealProp trades its class 1 building for Southco's class 1 building. This is not possible because Southco does not have a class 1 building.
  Option B: RealProp trades its class 1 building for Trustcorp's class 2 buildings. This is not possible because RealProp can only trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Option C: RealProp trades its class 1 building for Southco's class 2 building and Trustcorp's class 3 building. This is not possible because Trustcorp does not have a class 3 building.
  Option D: RealProp trades its class 1 building for Trustcorp's class 2 buildings. Then, Southco trades its class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. This is possible.
  Option E: RealProp trades its class 1 building for Trustcorp's class 2 building. This is not possible because RealProp can only trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis: 
  We can start by looking at the buildings that can be traded and the possible trades that can be made. 
  RealProp can trade the Garza Tower for another class 1 building or trade it for two class 2 buildings. 
  RealProp can also trade either the Yates House or the Zimmer House for two class 3 buildings. 
  Southco can trade the Flores Tower for another class 1 building or trade the Lynch Building for two class 3 buildings. 
  Trustcorp can trade any of their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings. 
  Based on these possible trades, we can eliminate answer choices that are not possible. 

Elimination:
  A: Not possible because RealProp would need to trade a class 1 building for a class 2 building to make this work. 
  B: Not possible because RealProp would need to trade a class 3 building for a class 2 building to make this work. 
  C: Possible. RealProp can trade the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower and trade the Yates House for the King Building and the Ortiz Building. Southco can trade the Lynch Building for the Zimmer House and another class 3 building. Trustcorp does not need to make any trades. 
  D: Not possible because RealProp would need to trade a class 1 building for a class 2 building to make this work. 
  E: Not possible because Southco would need to trade a class 1 building for a class 2 building to make this work. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns three buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns two buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns three buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  There are three types of trades that can be made.
  A class 1 building can be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  A class 2 building can be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  A building can be traded for another building of the same class.
  
  Analysis:
  RealProp cannot trade the Yates House or the Zimmer House for a class 2 building, so the only possible trade for RealProp is to trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings. This means that Trustcorp must give up two class 2 buildings, and Southco must give up one of its class 2 buildings. Therefore, the possible buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made are:
  RealProp: the Yates House and the Zimmer House (class 3) and two class 2 buildings from Trustcorp
  Southco: the Flores Tower (class 1) and one class 2 building
  Trustcorp: the Garza Tower (class 1) and the remaining class 2 building and the Ortiz Building (class 2).
  
  Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Solution:
  Option A is not possible because RealProp does not own the Flores Tower and Southco does not own the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  Option B is not possible because RealProp does not own the King Building and Trustcorp does not own the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  Option C is possible. RealProp can trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1). Southco can trade the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3). Trustcorp does not need to make any trades.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Meyer Building (class 2).
  Option E is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Explanation: 
  We can see that there are three different classes of buildings and each trade must involve buildings of the same class or different classes, as described above. 
  Therefore, in order to make a valid trade, a company must have at least two buildings of the same class or one class 1 building to trade for two class 2 buildings or one class 2 building to trade for two class 3 buildings. 
  Now, let's examine each option:
  A: RealProp has only one class 1 building, but it needs two class 2 buildings to make a valid trade. Southco has no class 3 buildings to trade. Trustcorp has no class 1 buildings to trade. This is not a valid combination of buildings for a single trade.
  B: RealProp has no class 2 buildings to trade. Southco has no class 3 buildings to trade. Trustcorp has no class 3 buildings to trade. This is not a valid combination of buildings for a single trade.
  C: RealProp has one class 1 building to trade for two class 2 buildings. Southco has one class 2 building to trade for two class 3 buildings. Trustcorp has no buildings to trade. This is a valid combination of buildings for a single trade.
  D: RealProp has one class 1 building to trade for two class 2 buildings. Southco has no class 3 buildings to trade. Trustcorp has one class 2 building to trade for two class 3 buildings. This is a valid combination of buildings for a single trade.
  E: RealProp has no class 2 buildings to trade. Southco has one class 2 building to trade for two class 3 buildings. Trustcorp has all class 2 buildings and no class 1 or class 3 buildings to trade. This is not a valid combination of buildings for a single trade.

  - From the constraint that T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - From the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, Z must be mentioned in chapter 7 and S must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  - This leaves only R to be mentioned in chapter 1.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  - Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  - Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, U is in chapter 3, so X must be in chapter 4.
  - Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T must be in chapter 2 and W must be in chapter 5 or 6.
  - Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, S and Z must be in chapters 1, 4, 6, or 7.
  - Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, W is in chapter 6.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The only option that could be true is that W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Seven clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z) must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then:
  - T cannot be in chapter 1, and W must be after T with two chapters in between, so W must be in chapter 6.
  - X must be in chapter 4 since U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6. None of the other clues' locations are determined by this information, so any of them could be in any of the remaining chapters.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The novel consists of 7 chapters.
  - 7 different clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z) are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3:
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  - W must be mentioned after T and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, so W must be mentioned in either chapter 6 or chapter 7.
  - X must be mentioned in either chapter 4 or chapter 5.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  
  A: R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, as T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and T must be mentioned before W.
  B: R can be mentioned in chapter 5, as there are no constraints regarding the placement of R.
  C: S cannot be mentioned in chapter 7, as S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  D: W cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, as W must be mentioned after T and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  E: X cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, as U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues to be mentioned in the novel: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Recall that U is mentioned in chapter 3. If we place U in chapter 3, we have the following possibilities for the placement of the other clues:
- If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, which means T must be mentioned in chapter 4. This means that W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 7. Then, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 5, but it is not possible to satisfy the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, A is not possible.
- If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 7. Then, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 3 (in some order). This satisfies all constraints, so B is possible.
- If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 4. This means that T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and X must be mentioned in chapter 3. Then, R must be mentioned in chapter 1, which satisfies all constraints, so C is possible.
- If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4, which means that X must be mentioned in chapter 7. This means that S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 3 (in some order), and R and U must be mentioned in chapters 1 and 5 (in some order). This satisfies all constraints, so D is possible.
- If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then U must be mentioned in chapter 3, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 5. This means that T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 1 and 6 (in some order). This satisfies all constraints, so E is possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3. This means that T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4. T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 2, so T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4. W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5, so W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or later. Therefore, R could be mentioned in chapter 1, S could be mentioned in chapter 7, and W could be mentioned in chapter 6. This leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 5, which is a valid option.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each of the clues must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints:

    - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then:
    - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
    - W must be mentioned after T, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or chapter 7.
    - X must be mentioned in chapter 4 if U is mentioned in chapter 3.
  
  A: R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 if U is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 if U is mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: S cannot be mentioned in chapter 7 if U is mentioned in chapter 3.
  D: W can be mentioned in chapter 6 if U is mentioned in chapter 3.
  E: X must be mentioned in chapter 4 if U is mentioned in chapter 3.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  We need to find the possible order of clues in the seven chapters of the mystery novel.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Approach:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. So, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, and it must be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, X cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5.

Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, if U is mentioned in chapter 3, then R could be mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. The novel consists of seven chapters, and each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.

  3. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  4. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  5. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  6. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4. From constraint 6, we know that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 4. From constraint 5, we know that W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5. From constraint 3, we know that T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4. From constraint 2, we know that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3. From constraint 4, we know that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4. From constraint 1, we know that R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 5.

Action: Answer("B")

Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must be exactly two students. The only option that lists exactly two students is option B: Kramer, O'Neill. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, any option which does not include Kramer and O'Neill will be incorrect.
  From condition 4, we know that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other. So, option A, which only includes two students, is incorrect.
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So, option D, which includes Megregian, is incorrect because Jiang is not included.
  From condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. So, option C, which includes Kramer, Lopez, and O'Neill, is incorrect because it violates this condition. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is option B, which includes Kramer and O'Neill.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that both Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane. Using condition 4, we know that only two students review the same play. Therefore, the other student who reviews Tamerlane must be one of the students who reviews the same play as another student. 
Using condition 2, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot be the other student who reviews Tamerlane since there is no student who reviews both Tamerlane and any play Jiang reviews. 
Using condition 3, Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez each review only one of the three plays. 
The only possible combination of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using the given information, we can infer that Megregian must review at least two plays since both Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane. Also, since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must review Sunset or Undulation. Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez must review only one play each. Therefore, the only possible combination is that Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, and Megregian reviews all the three plays. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Let's analyze the options:
  A: Jiang reviews Tamerlane, which contradicts condition 2.
  B: This option is consistent with all the conditions.
  C: This option has three students reviewing Tamerlane, which contradicts condition 4.
  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane, which contradicts condition 2.
  E: This option has three students reviewing Tamerlane, which contradicts condition 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Five students are reviewing one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays.
  
Process of elimination:
  - We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, options A, C, and E are eliminated.
  - We also know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, option D is eliminated.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using the above knowledge, we can eliminate options A and E because they include Jiang, who doesn't review Tamerlane and Megregian, who doesn't review any play that Jiang reviews. Option C can be eliminated because it includes Lopez who reviews fewer plays than Megregian. 

Action: Answer("B")  

Option B is a possible list of students who review Tamerlane, as it includes Kramer and O'Neill who both review Tamerlane. Option D is also a possible list, but it includes Megregian who could review Sunset or Undulation, which would violate the condition that exactly two students review the same play.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  From condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and E because they only have one student reviewing Tamerlane.
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, we can eliminate choice D because Megregian and Jiang cannot review the same play.
  From condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, we can eliminate choice C because it has all three of them reviewing Tamerlane, which would mean Megregian reviews fewer plays than both Kramer and Lopez.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, any option that does not include Kramer and O'Neill cannot be correct.
  
  From condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. So, any option that includes more than two students cannot be correct.
  
  From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So, any option that includes Jiang cannot be correct.
  
  From condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. So, any option that includes Megregian and does not include Kramer and Lopez cannot be correct.
  
  Therefore, the only possible option is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Five students are reviewing three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they must be two students who review the same play or plays as each other.
  - If Kramer is one of the two students who review the same play or plays as each other, then the other student must be O'Neill.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means that Jiang cannot review Tamerlane, so Jiang is not part of the two students who review the same play or plays as each other.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. This means that Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez each review only one of the plays.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  - The only option that includes Kramer and O'Neill as students who review Tamerlane is option B. Therefore, the answer is B.

  At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.

  No more than 4 French works can be selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Elimination:
- Choices A and B are incorrect because they require the selection of a French novel and a French play, which would violate the rule of selecting no more than 4 French works.
- Choice C is incorrect because it requires the selection of a French play, which would violate the rule that if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
- Choices D and E are possible, but we must check if they satisfy all the requirements.

Verification:
- Choice D: If we select two French novels, we can select at most two French works, which means we can select at most one French play. Therefore, we must select at least one Russian novel and one novel of any language. This satisfies the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels, and the requirement of selecting at least three novels. If we select one Russian novel and one novel of any language, we still satisfy the requirements, but we only have 3 works selected. Therefore, we must select another work, which can be any of the remaining 3 novels. This gives us a total of 5 works, which is the minimum required. Therefore, Choice D is correct.
- Choice E: If we select two Russian novels, we must select at least one French novel and one novel of any language. If we select another French novel, we violate the rule of selecting no more than 4 French works. Therefore, we must select one of the French plays. This satisfies the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels, and the requirement of selecting at least three novels. If we select another novel of any language, we still satisfy the requirements, but we only have 4 works selected. Therefore, we must select another work, which can be the remaining French play or the Russian play. This gives us a total of 5 or 6 works, depending on the choice of the last work. Therefore, Choice E is also correct.

  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Trades can be made only between buildings of the same class or between buildings of different classes as specified.
  A: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and it is a class 1 building. Southco owns the Flores Tower which is also a class 1 building. Therefore, it is possible for RealProp to own the Garza Tower and the Flores Tower, so A can be true.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower which is a class 1 building and the Meyer Building which is a class 2 building. Therefore, it is not possible for Southco to own the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building at the same time. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: Southco owns the Garza Tower which is a class 1 building and the Lynch Building which is a class 2 building. Therefore, it is not possible for Southco to own the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building at the same time. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Flores Tower which is a class 1 building and the Ortiz Building which is a class 2 building. Therefore, it is not possible for Trustcorp to own the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building at the same time. Therefore, D cannot be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing takes exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis: 
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday since Hong does not testify on Monday. So, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. Then, Hong and Iturbe would have to testify on Tuesday. But, this would mean that there are no witnesses left to testify on Monday and Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Wednesday. Then, Garcia must testify on Monday and Hong must testify on Tuesday. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday since he cannot testify on Monday or Tuesday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Five witnesses - Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson - are to testify on three days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Each witness testifies only once.
  3. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  4. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  5. Two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  6. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  7. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday. Therefore, the following must be true:
  1. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  2. At least one witness testifies on Monday, which cannot be Hong.
  3. Franco and Hong testify on Tuesday, which means Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday.
  
This leaves Garcia to testify on Monday and Jackson to testify on Wednesday. 

Action: Answer("C") - Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
- The hearing takes exactly 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
- Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco or Hong. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so he cannot testify on the same day as Franco or Hong. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday, and Franco must testify on Wednesday. Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Hong and Jackson must testify on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("C") Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  - If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday since Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - If Hong testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which contradicts the given condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday.
  - Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday and Hong testifies on Tuesday, then one of Franco or Garcia must also testify on Tuesday.
  - However, Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day, so Garcia must testify on Monday and Franco must testify on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing is to take exactly three days of one week: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday since Hong does not testify on Monday. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco cannot testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday. Since Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, Garcia must testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday, and Hong does not testify on Monday, so Jackson must testify on Monday. This means that Hong must testify on Wednesday, and Iturbe is the only witness left to testify on Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing is to take exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must be scheduled on Tuesday because there are exactly two witnesses scheduled on Tuesday. Thus, the schedule must satisfy the following conditions:
On Monday, at least one witness testifies, and that witness is not Hong.
On Tuesday, Franco and Hong testify.
On Wednesday, Iturbe testifies.

Therefore, Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. Thus, Garcia must testify on Monday or Wednesday. However, if Garcia testifies on Wednesday, then Franco would have to testify on Monday, which is not possible because Franco testifies on the same day as Hong. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The schedule must meet the following conditions:
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  
  If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia must testify on Wednesday, because Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. However, this would mean that Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which contradicts one of the given conditions. Therefore, Franco cannot testify on Tuesday.
  
  If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Garcia must testify on Monday, because Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. And Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Hong would then have to testify on Tuesday, because exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. This satisfies all of the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday (because Hong does not testify on Monday). Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday (because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday). Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday. Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, the other witness testifying on Tuesday must be Hong. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday (because Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day). Finally, since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, Jackson must testify on Monday (because at least one witness testifies on Monday) and Garcia must testify on Wednesday (because Garcia has not testified on Monday or Tuesday). 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday, and so Garcia must testify on Monday. This violates the condition that "At least one witness testifies on Monday". Therefore, Franco must testify on Wednesday. Iturbe also testifies on Wednesday, so Hong must testify on Tuesday, and Garcia must testify on Monday. This satisfies all of the conditions.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing is three days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco and Garcia do not testify on the same day.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday since Hong does not testify on Monday.
  If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia must testify on Monday and Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, which satisfies all the other conditions.
  If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Hong and one other witness must testify on Monday, and Garcia and the remaining witness must testify on Tuesday. However, this violates the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.

  D: Wong is on the team, and Myers must also be on the team. Therefore, Yoder must also be on the team. Keep D.
  E: There is no condition that requires Yoder or Zayre to be on the team. Eliminate E.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  To form a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team, we need to look for employees who are mentioned in the constraints related to other employees who have to be on the team. 
  The only pair that meets this criteria is Wong and Myers. If Wong is on the team, Myers must also be on the team. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The research team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, if Wong is not on the team, then at least one of Myers or Yoder must be on the team. Thus, Ortega and Wong is the only pair of employees where at least one of them must be on the team.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  To find the answer, we need to look for a pair of employees that must be on the team. 
  Wong must be on the team if Myers and Yoder are on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must be on the team. 
  If Myers is on the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. 
  Therefore, the pair of employees that must be on the team is Myers and Yoder.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  If Myers is on the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Therefore, we cannot select Ortega or Paine.
  If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Therefore, we must select Paine and Thomson if we select Schmidt.
  If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, we must select Myers and Yoder if we select Wong.
  Therefore, we can create pairs with Myers, Schmidt, and Wong. 
  The pairs are Myers and Yoder, Schmidt and Paine, and Wong and Myers.

Action: Answer("B")  
  Wong is on the team, and both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, the pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Ortega and Wong.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  
Elimination:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt cannot be on the team together because if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Therefore, Ortega cannot be on the team if Schmidt is on the team.
  B: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, Wong and Ortega cannot be on the team together because Ortega is not Myers or Yoder.
  C: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Therefore, Paine and Schmidt cannot be the pair of employees because they must be on the team together.
  D: Thomson and Yoder can be on the team together because there is no constraint on them being on the team together.
  E: Yoder and Zayre can be on the team together because there is no constraint on them being on the team together.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The question provides a set of constraints that limit the selection of employees for a research team. The question asks to determine a pair of employees that must be included in the team.
A: Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team. Schmidt and Thomson must be on the team if Schmidt is on the team. Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team if Wong is on the team. None of the constraints requires Ortega and Schmidt to be on the team.
B: Wong must be on the team if Myers and Yoder are on the team, but Ortega is excluded from the team if Myers is on it. Thus, Ortega and Wong cannot both be on the team.
C: Schmidt and Thomson must be on the team if Schmidt is on the team. Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team. Thus, Paine and Schmidt cannot both be on the team.
D: Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team if Wong is on the team. Thomson must be on the team if Schmidt is on the team. Thus, Thomson and Yoder could be on the team.
E: None of the constraints requires Yoder and Zayre to be on the team.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The research team will include at least four employees from eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Elimination:
  A: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Thus, Ortega cannot be on the team with Schmidt. Eliminate A.
  B: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Thus, Ortega cannot be on the team with Wong. Eliminate B.
  C: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Thus, Paine must be on the team with Schmidt. Keep C.
  D: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Thus, Yoder must be on the team with Wong. Keep D.
  E: None of the employees in this option are restricted by the conditions. Eliminate E.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Action: 
  We need to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team. 
  If we select Myers, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Therefore, we can eliminate option A.
  If we select Wong, then both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, we can eliminate option B, C and E.
  If we select Schmidt, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Therefore, we can eliminate option A and E.

  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  
  A: Young is assigned parking space #1 which is a lower-numbered parking space than Togowa. This violates the rule "Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa."
  B: This assignment follows all the rules. 
  C: This assignment violates the rule "Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young."
  D: This assignment follows all the rules. 
  E: This assignment violates the rule "Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: 
    - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    
Analysis: 
  From the rules, we know that Robertson must be assigned to parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, options A and E are incorrect because Robertson is not assigned to one of those parking spaces. 
  Option B is incorrect because it violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. 
  Option C is incorrect because it violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. 
  Option D satisfies all of the rules and is a valid assignment of parking spaces to the new employees.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Six employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young) must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4. According to the rules, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Young cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2. 
  
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu --> Young is assigned parking space #1, which is not possible.
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu --> This assignment is possible.
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn --> This assignment violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu --> This assignment is possible.
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn --> This assignment violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Six employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young) must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  From the rules, we know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
  Also, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, which means Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which means Xu must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  From the above analysis, we can eliminate choices A, B, and E because they do not follow the rules. 
  Choice C assigns Togowa to parking space #1, which violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned to parking space #5 or #6.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned to parking space #1 or #2, since those parking spaces are lower-numbered than parking space assigned to Young.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned to parking space #1 or #2, since those parking spaces are lower-numbered than parking space assigned to Souza.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Young cannot be assigned to parking space #1 or #2, since those parking spaces are lower-numbered than parking space assigned to Togowa.
  - Based on the above analysis, the only possible parking space for Robertson is #3 and the only possible parking space for Young is #4.
  - Therefore, the only possible options are A, C, and D.
  - Option A violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Option C violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Option D satisfies all the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
  Explanation: According to the rules given, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and E since those options have Robertson assigned to parking space #5 or #6. Option C violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Option D satisfies all the given rules.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The rules state that:
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  From the last rule, we know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means that the other five employees must be assigned parking spaces #5 or #6. 
  From the third rule, we know that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. This means that Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5, because that would mean that Young would have to be assigned parking space #6, which is not allowed. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #6, and Young must be assigned parking space #5.
  From the first rule, we know that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #5. 
  From the second rule, we know that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Xu must be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. 
  We can now eliminate choices A and B, because they violate the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4. We can also eliminate choice E, because it violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project since Tiffany must be assigned if Ryan is assigned.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923 since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Since there are only four years and each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it, there is no possibility of two students being assigned to the same year.
  
Analysis:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then she cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922. If Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's and Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a possible assignment of years to each of the four students.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany must be assigned to the remaining three years.
  
  A: Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 because if Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  C: Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922 because if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1923.
  D: Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1924 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany must be assigned to the remaining three years.
  E: Yoshio could be assigned to 1922 because Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany must be assigned to the remaining three years, which are 1921, 1923, and 1924.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
  A: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
  B: If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. We don't know if Mollie is assigned to the project, so we cannot conclude that Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. We know that Ryan is assigned to the project, so Onyx must be assigned to 1922, which means Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1924.
  D: If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. We know that Ryan is assigned to the project, so Tiffany must be assigned to the project, but we don't know which year Tiffany will be assigned to.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922. If Yoshio is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. This satisfies all the conditions of the problem.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany must be assigned to the remaining three years: 1921, 1922, and 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis and Tiffany must be assigned to 1921, 1922, or 1924, but Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Tiffany is assigned to the project. 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, which means that Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. 
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1923. However, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Tiffany is assigned to the project. 
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1923. However, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Tiffany is assigned to the project. 
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, Tiffany, and Onyx will also be assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, Tiffany, and Onyx will also be assigned to the project. 
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. But Ryan is already assigned to the project, so Tiffany must also be assigned to the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. But Mollie is not assigned to the project, so we can ignore this condition.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. So if Ryan is assigned to 1924, then Onyx must be assigned to 1923. This means that neither Louis nor Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
  Therefore, Louis must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and Mollie cannot be assigned to that year. Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to 1924. This leaves Onyx and Yoshio to be assigned to 1921 and 1922, but it is not clear which one of them is assigned to which year.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project:
  - Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  
Analysis:
  - If Ryan is assigned to 1924, Onyx must be assigned to 1923, but this is not possible because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project, and therefore Ryan must be assigned to the project, which is not possible because both Ryan and Yoshio are already assigned.
  - If Ryan is assigned to 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to 1921, and Mollie must be assigned to 1922, which is not possible because both Ryan and Yoshio are already assigned.
  - If Ryan is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1920, which is not one of the available years.
  - If Yoshio is assigned to 1924, then Louis must be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany must be assigned to the project, which means Ryan must be assigned to 1922 and Onyx to 1921. This satisfies all the conditions.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project:
    If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
    If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
    Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
    If Mollie is assigned, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.

A: Louis can't be assigned to 1923 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned because Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
B: Mollie can't be assigned to 1921 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned because Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
C: Onyx can't be assigned to 1922 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned because Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
D: Tiffany can't be assigned to 1924 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned because Tiffany must be assigned if Ryan is assigned.
E: Yoshio can be assigned to 1922 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  We need to assign 4 students to the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then we can only assign Louis, Mollie, or Tiffany to the remaining two years.
  A: If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923, which contradicts the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923, which contradicts the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and since both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, we cannot assign Tiffany to the remaining year, which contradicts the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: If Tiffany is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means that Onyx must be assigned to 1923. Since both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, we can assign Louis to 1921 and Mollie to 1922. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: If Yoshio is assigned to 1922, then we can assign Ryan to 1923, Onyx to 1922, and Mollie to 1921. Since both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, we can assign Tiffany to 1924 or Louis to 1923. Therefore, E could be true.
Action: Answer("D or E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project, as per the condition "If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project."
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, as per the condition "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923."
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, as per the condition "If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922."
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, as per the condition "If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's."
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, and Tiffany is also assigned to the project, then the only possible year assignments are: Ryan-1922, Yoshio-1923, Tiffany-1924, Onyx-1921 or Mollie-1921 and Onyx-1922.

Action: Answer("C")  
The assignment Onyx-1922 could be true.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  2. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  3. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  4. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then:
  1. Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  2. Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. So, Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  3. Mollie cannot be assigned to the project because if she is assigned, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, which is not possible as Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  4. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1923 and Yoshio must be assigned to 1921 or 1924.
  
Options:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1923. - This is true.
  B: Mollie is assigned to 1921. - This is not possible as Mollie is not assigned to the project.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1922. - This is true.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924. - This is not possible as Tiffany must be assigned to the project and Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922. - This is not possible as Yoshio must be assigned to 1921 or 1924.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. The lab sessions are scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session being held each morning and one each afternoon.
  2. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following:
  - Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on either Wednesday or Friday.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Lan and Olivia's sessions must be on different days. Since Julio's session is on Thursday, Lan and Olivia's sessions must be on Wednesday and Friday, but we do not know which one leads which.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Therefore, Nessa's session must be on either Wednesday afternoon or Friday afternoon.

We can determine which sessions two other lab assistants lead:
  - Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and there is only one afternoon session left, we know that Nessa leads the Friday afternoon session. Therefore, we know which session Nessa leads.
  - Since Lan and Olivia's sessions must be on different days, and we know that Lan's session is on Wednesday or Friday, we know that Olivia's session is on the other day. Therefore, we know which session Olivia leads.

Thus, we can determine which sessions three lab assistants lead: Nessa, Olivia, and either Lan or Rebecca. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six lab sessions: 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, we can use the given constraints to deduce which lab assistants lead the remaining sessions.
  - We can start by applying the constraint that Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Since Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  - We know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. Since there is only one day left (Wednesday), Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions. 
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. Since Lan has not been assigned to any session yet, she must lead a morning session on either Thursday or Friday. This means that Olivia must lead the morning session on the other day (Friday or Thursday, respectively).
  - This leaves only one session unassigned, which must be led by the remaining lab assistant, which is Nessa.
  - Therefore, we can determine which sessions are led by Kevin, Rebecca, Lan, Nessa, and Olivia, which is a total of 5 lab assistants.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are 6 lab sessions: 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  7. Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.

We can use the given information to create a chart of possible lab assistant and session assignments. 

| Day       | Morning Session | Afternoon Session |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Wednesday | Lan            | Kevin/Rebecca      |
| Thursday  | Nessa          | Julio             |
| Friday    | Olivia         | Kevin/Rebecca      |

From the chart, we can see that we can determine the session assignments for Lan, Nessa, and Olivia. Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The lab assistants are: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are six lab sessions scheduled over three days.
  Each session will be led by a different lab assistant.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we know that Olivia's session must be on Friday, and Julio's session must be on Wednesday.
  We can also determine that Nessa cannot lead the Friday afternoon session because Olivia's session is on Friday and Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. That means Nessa must lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  We know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, and there is only one day left for them to lead their sessions, which is Wednesday.
  That leaves Lan as the only lab assistant whose session assignment we cannot determine.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can use the given constraints to determine the schedule for Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, and Olivia.
  - We can then use the remaining constraints to determine the schedule for Lan and the number of possible schedules for each assistant.
  
Action: Answer("C")  (three)
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, we can make the following deductions:
  1. Julio's session is on an earlier day than Olivia's session, so Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  2. Nessa must lead the other afternoon session, which is on Wednesday.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, which can only be Thursday. 
  4. Lan cannot lead the Thursday morning session, so she must lead the Friday morning session.
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions of all the lab assistants except for one. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are 6 lab sessions, one each morning and one each afternoon for 3 days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Analysis:
  1. If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  2. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, but we don't know which day that is.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, but we don't know which day that is.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, but we already know that Olivia's session is on Friday afternoon, which means Lan's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday, whichever day Kevin and Rebecca are not leading their sessions.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Since we know that Lan's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday, and we know that Julio is leading the Thursday afternoon session, we can determine which sessions Kevin and Rebecca are leading, since they must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by Julio, Lan, and Olivia. We cannot determine the sessions led by Nessa. Thus, the answer is 2.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. Six lab sessions: one morning and one afternoon session each day for three days (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then:
  1. Julio's session is already assigned.
  2. Olivia's session must meet on a later day of the week than Julio's.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, which must be either Wednesday or Friday.
  4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, which must be either Thursday or Friday.
  5. Lan cannot lead a session on Thursday, so she must lead a morning session on either Wednesday or Friday.
  
  Therefore, the only lab assistant whose session is not determined is Lan if she leads a morning session on Wednesday or Friday. For all other lab assistants, we can determine which sessions they lead.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach: 
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can use the constraints to determine which sessions Kevin, Rebecca, Lan, Nessa, and Olivia lead.
  - We can then determine which session is left for the lab assistant who has not been assigned a session.

Action: Answer("C") 

If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session:
  - From the constraint that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, we know that they must lead the Wednesday morning and Wednesday afternoon sessions (in some order).
  - From the constraint that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, we know that Lan must lead either the Thursday morning or Friday morning session (since Olivia's session is on Thursday afternoon).
  - From the constraint that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, we know that Nessa must lead either the Wednesday afternoon, Thursday afternoon, or Friday afternoon session.
  - From the constraint that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, we know that Julio must lead either the Wednesday morning or Thursday morning session (since Olivia's session is on Thursday afternoon).
  - Therefore, the only remaining session is the one that is not on Thursday afternoon, which is the Friday morning session.
  - Thus, we can determine which sessions Kevin, Rebecca, Lan, Nessa, and Olivia lead, so the answer is C: three.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session:
  1. Julio cannot lead the Wednesday morning or afternoon session.
  2. Olivia cannot lead the Thursday morning or afternoon session.
  3. Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, so they must lead the Wednesday morning and afternoon sessions, or the Friday morning and afternoon sessions.
  5. Lan must lead either the Wednesday morning or Friday morning session.
  
  Therefore, we can determine the lab sessions of five of the six lab assistants, except for Lan.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then this means that wall 1 has both Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor. This is possible, so A can be true.
B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then this means that wall 3 has both Franz's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil. This is possible, so B can be true.
C: If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then this means that wall 1 or 2 has Greene's oil in the upper position. This is possible, so C can be true.
D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then this means that wall 1, 2 or 3 has Hidalgo's watercolor in the lower position. This is possible, so D can be true.
E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then this means that wall 2 has both Isaacs's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil. However, this would mean that wall 2 has the work of only one student displayed on it, which is not allowed. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Each of the four walls has one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  2. No wall has only watercolors.
  3. No wall has only one student's work.
  4. Franz and Isaacs cannot have paintings on the same wall.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall where Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 4, we know that Franz and Isaacs cannot have paintings on the same wall. Therefore, option A and E cannot be true. 
  From condition 5, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall where Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, option C cannot be true.
  From condition 6, we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, option D must be true. 
  This leaves us with option B as the only possible answer.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four art students will display exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then wall 1 must have the paintings of Franz and Greene, which means that Hidalgo's paintings must be on wall 4. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so his watercolor must be in the upper position of wall 2. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions, so A can be true.
B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then wall 3 must have the paintings of Franz and Hidalgo, which means that Isaacs's paintings must be on wall 1. But this arrangement violates the condition that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: This can be true. If Greene's oil is displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's watercolor is displayed, then Greene's watercolor must be in the upper position of wall 2, which satisfies the given conditions.
D: This can be true. If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in the lower position of wall 1, then Hidalgo's oil must be in the upper position of wall 3, which satisfies the given conditions.
E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then wall 2 must have the paintings of Isaacs and Hidalgo, which means that Franz's paintings must be on wall 3. But this arrangement violates the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, E cannot be true.

  - Option A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then the wall will have only the work of two students - Franz and Greene. Violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Hence, option A cannot be true.
  - Option B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then the wall will have only the work of two students - Franz and Hidalgo. Violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Hence, option B cannot be true.
  - Option C: As per the given information, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Hence, Greene's oil cannot be displayed in an upper position. Option C cannot be true.
  - Option D: There is no condition that violates Hidalgo's watercolor being displayed in a lower position. Hence, option D can be true.
  - Option E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then the wall will have only the work of two students - Isaacs and Hidalgo. Violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Hence, option E cannot be true.

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  Let's try to eliminate each option one by one.
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
    According to the given conditions, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, this option cannot be true. 
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    This option is possible because there is no condition that prevents Franz's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil from being displayed on the same wall.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
    According to the given conditions, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, this option cannot be true.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
    This option is possible because there is no condition that prevents Hidalgo's watercolor from being displayed in the lower position of a wall.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    This option is possible because there is no condition that prevents Isaacs's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil from being displayed on the same wall.
  
  Therefore, the answer is C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.

  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  - We can use process of elimination to determine which option cannot be true.
  - Option A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed on a different wall, and it is possible to arrange the paintings to satisfy all the given conditions. So, option A can be true.
  - Option B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed on a different wall, and it is possible to arrange the paintings to satisfy all the given conditions. So, option B can be true.
  - Option C: Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. So, option C cannot be true.
  - Option D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position, and it is possible to arrange the paintings to satisfy all the given conditions. So, option D can be true.
  - Option E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on a different wall, and it is possible to arrange the paintings to satisfy all the given conditions. So, option E can be true.
  - Therefore, the answer is C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. This cannot be true because Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The exhibition room has four walls numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  Each wall displays two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  Each student displays exactly one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  Option A cannot be true because if Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed on a different wall. However, since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  Option B can be true. There is no restriction that Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  Option C can be true. According to the given conditions, Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. This means Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position.
  Option D can be true. There is no restriction on the position of Hidalgo's watercolor.
  Option E can be true. There is no restriction that Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.

Therefore, the answer is Option A. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four walls has two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's oil must be on the same wall in the lower position. This means that wall 1 has both of Franz's paintings and wall 2 has both of Greene's paintings. This violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Franz's oil must be on the same wall in the lower position. This means that wall 3 has both of Hidalgo's paintings and wall 4 has both of Isaacs's paintings. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, B can be true.
C: According to the given condition, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil cannot be displayed in an upper position. Therefore, C cannot be true.
D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position on the same wall. This means that wall 1 has both of Hidalgo's paintings and wall 2 has both of Greene's paintings. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, D can be true.
E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Isaacs's oil must be on the same wall in the lower position. This means that wall 3 has both of Hidalgo's paintings and wall 4 has both of Isaacs's paintings.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert
  D: Kyle and Nina
  E: Olivia and Kyle
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  
Solution:
  From condition 1, George's report will be on Tuesday.
  From condition 2, Olivia and Robert will not give afternoon reports. So, they will give morning reports.
  From condition 3, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday (next day) Helen and Irving must give reports. So, Nina's report cannot be on Monday.
  From condition 4, we have six reports in total. So, only two students will not give reports.
  If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But, we have only two reports left for Wednesday. So, Nina must give a report. 
  From the above analysis, we can conclude that Nina's report is on Wednesday, and Helen and Irving's reports are on Tuesday. Also, Olivia and Robert's reports are on Monday.
  So, the remaining pairs are George and Lenore and Kyle and Nina. George's report is on Tuesday, so he cannot be a part of the pair who must give reports on Wednesday. So, the only possible pair is Kyle and Nina.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the conditions above, we can create a table to determine which students can give reports on each day:

| Day      | Morning | Afternoon |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Monday   |         |           |
| Tuesday  | George  |           |
| Wednesday|         |           |

1. Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Wednesday.
2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports on Monday and Wednesday.
3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
4. We have already assigned George, Olivia, Robert, and Nina to specific days, so they cannot be part of the answer.
5. This leaves us with Lenore, Kyle, and Helen as the remaining students.

Based on the conditions above, the only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other are Helen and Nina. Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. George must give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports.
  6. Reports will be given during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then exactly one report must be given in the morning and one report must be given in the afternoon on Tuesday.
  - If Nina gives a report, then either she gives a report on Wednesday or she gives a report on Monday or Tuesday. 
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day.
  - If neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, then they must give morning reports.
  - Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, and if Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day.
  - This means that if Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, then they must give reports on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  
Solution:
  - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he/she will be paired with either Helen or Irving on Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then she will be paired with Helen or Irving on Wednesday.
  - Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  - The remaining students are Lenore, Kyle, Olivia, and Robert.
  - Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they must give reports in the morning.
  - Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then the only pair that can give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Irving.
  - The only pair that includes Nina is (H)elen and (N)ina.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  - Exactly 6 students will give individual oral reports during 3 consecutive days.
  - Exactly 2 reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Process of elimination:
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If Nina gives a report:
  - Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, because it is the only day George can give a report.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the same day.
  
  If Nina does not give a report:
  - Then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
  
  Therefore, the only pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Nina.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The seminar has eight students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

To determine which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other, we can use the following logic:
  - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, and no one is left to give reports on Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then no one is left to give reports on Tuesday, and any pair of students who give reports on Wednesday must be the answer.

Analysis:
  - George must give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they cannot give reports on Wednesday afternoon.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, so they cannot give reports on Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then any pair of students who give reports on Wednesday must be the answer.
  - Therefore, the answer must be a pair of students that includes Nina.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Only George can give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after the day of Nina's report), Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can deduce the following:
  1. George must give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. So, they must give morning reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports. But, there is only one spot left in the morning, so Nina cannot give a report on Monday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  4. By condition 3, Helen and Irving must give reports on Thursday if Nina gives a report on Wednesday. But, there is no Thursday in the given days. So, Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Monday.
  5. By conditions 3 and 4, we know that Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  
Now, we can create a table to keep track of who has given reports on which day and time:

|     | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday |
| --- | ------ | ------- | --------- |
| AM  |  Nina  |  George |           |
| PM  | Olivia |  Helen  |  Irving   |

Using the table, we can see that the only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other are Helen and Nina.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. George gives a report only on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  6. If a pair of students give reports on the same day as each other, then they must give reports on Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that George will give his report on Tuesday. By condition 4, there will be two reports given on Tuesday, so George will be paired with one other student. From condition 6, we know that if George is paired with another student, then that pair must give their reports on Wednesday. Therefore, we can eliminate answer choices A, B, C, and D because none of those pairs necessarily have to give their reports on Wednesday. This leaves us with answer choice E, Olivia and Kyle, which we can select as the answer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Six students will give reports over three consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
  
Using the information given, we can create a table to keep track of which students can give reports on which days, and in which time slots:

|          | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Morning  |        |         |           |
| Afternoon|        |         |           |

We know that George cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday, and that he must give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, George must give a report on Tuesday morning. We can update our table:

|          | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Morning  |        |  George |           |
| Afternoon|        |         |           |

We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must both give reports on Monday morning. We can update our table again:

|          | Monday      | Tuesday | Wednesday |
|----------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Morning  | Olivia, Robert | George |           |
| Afternoon|             |         |           |

If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day (Tuesday or Wednesday). We can consider two cases:

Case 1: Nina gives a report on Monday

If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. Since George has already given a report on Tuesday morning, Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday afternoon. This leaves Lenore and Kyle to give reports on Wednesday. We can update our table:

|          | Monday      | Tuesday          | Wednesday |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Morning  | Olivia, Robert | George          | Lenore, Kyle |
| Afternoon|             | Helen, Irving |           |

In this case, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are Lenore and Kyle.

Case 2: Nina gives a report on Tuesday

If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Wednesday. This means that they must give reports on Monday or Wednesday. If they give reports on Monday, then Lenore and Kyle must give reports on Wednesday. If they give reports on Wednesday, then Lenore and Kyle must give reports on Monday. We can consider two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: Helen and Irving give reports on Monday

If Helen and Irving give reports on Monday, then Lenore and Kyle must give reports on Wednesday. We can update our table:

|          | Monday          | Tuesday | Wednesday     |
|----------|----------------|---------|---------------|
| Morning  | Olivia, Robert | George  |               |
| Afternoon| Helen, Irving  |         | Lenore, Kyle |

In this sub-case, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are Lenore and Kyle.

Sub-case 2.2: Helen and Irving give reports on Wednesday

If Helen and Irving give reports on Wednesday, then Lenore and Kyle must give reports on Monday. We can update our table:

|          | Monday          | Tuesday | Wednesday     |
|----------|----------------|---------|---------------|
| Morning  | Olivia, Robert | George  | Lenore, Kyle  |
| Afternoon|                |         | Helen, Irving |

In this sub-case, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are Lenore and Kyle.

Therefore, in both cases, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are Lenore and Kyle.

Answer: Answer("D")

  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
  A: There is no information to suggest that George and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day.
  B: There is no information to suggest that Helen and Nina must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day.
  C: There is no information to suggest that Irving and Robert must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day.
  D: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. If Kyle gives a report on Wednesday, then Nina and Kyle must give reports on the same day, but there is no information to suggest that they must give reports on Wednesday.
  E: Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so she cannot give a report on Wednesday afternoon. If Kyle gives a report on Wednesday, then Olivia and Kyle must give reports on the same day, but there is no information to suggest that they must give reports on Wednesday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.
Response 0:

  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it cannot be in space 2.
  - Since the shoe store is in space 2, the optometrist and the veterinarian cannot be in spaces 1 or 3.
  - If the pharmacy is not in space 1, it must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 7, which is at the other end of the row.
  - If the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses, they cannot be in spaces 1, 2, 3, or 7.
  - If the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it cannot be in space 3 or 5.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 2, the toy store can be in space 6. The optometrist and the veterinarian cannot be in spaces 1 or 3, so they must be in spaces 4 and 5, but their order is not specified. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it must be in space 1 or 7. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, they must be in spaces 3 and 5, but their order is not specified. Therefore, the toy store can be in space 6.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are seven spaces in a straight row in the shopping center.
- There are seven businesses: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
- If the shoe store is in space 2, it means the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7 (in either order).
- The optometrist and the veterinarian cannot be in spaces 1 and 3 because the pharmacy must be next to one of them.
- The toy store cannot be in space 1 or 3 because it cannot be next to the veterinarian.
- Therefore, the optometrist could be in space 5, the pharmacy could be in space 7, a restaurant could be in space 3, and the toy store could be in space 4.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
- The shoe store is in space 2.
- There are seven spaces, numbered 1 to 7.

Analysis:
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be in space 2.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so neither restaurant can be in space 2 or space 3.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the pharmacy cannot be in space 7 because it would not be next to either of them.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
- Therefore, the veterinarian must be in either space 4 or space 6.
- Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and the restaurant at the other end, the pharmacy must be in space 1 and one of the restaurants must be in space 7.
- The optometrist cannot be in space 5 because it would be next to the veterinarian, so option A is not possible.
- The only option that could be true is option D, with the toy store in space 6.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are four lectures on different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each lecture is given by one of the four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, or Jiang.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then either the sculptures lecture or the lithographs lecture must be last.
  
Analysis:
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the oil paintings lecture must be first or second, and the sculptures lecture or the lithographs lecture must be last. 
  Farley's lecture must be first or second, and Holden's lecture must be first. 
  Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be second and last, but their order is not determined. 
  Therefore, Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture, and Holden cannot give the sculptures lecture. 
  Garcia could give the oil paintings lecture, and Jiang could give the lithographs lecture. 
  Therefore, the answer is B or E.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures, one on each of the following topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then the oil paintings lecture must be first or second.
  
Analysis:
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then the oil paintings lecture must be first or second. This means that Farley's lecture must be first or second, since his lecture has to be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. This means that Holden's lecture must be first, since the watercolors lecture is third and the oil paintings lecture must be first or second.
  - Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture, since Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture. This means that B is false.
  - If Garcia does not give the oil paintings lecture, then he must give either the sculptures lecture or the lithographs lecture. This means that C and E are possible.
  - Holden gives the sculptures lecture. This means that D is false.
  - If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Jiang must give the lithographs lecture. This means that E is true.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The lectures are on four different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives a lecture on a different topic.
  - The lectures are given one at a time.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
If the watercolors lecture is third, then either Holden or Garcia must give the watercolors lecture. However, since Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, Garcia cannot give the watercolors lecture. Therefore, Holden must give the watercolors lecture. 

Knowledge:
  - Holden gives the watercolors lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  
If Holden gives the watercolors lecture, then Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be the oil paintings lecture and the lithographs lecture, but we don't know in which order. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so the only possible order of the lectures is Farley (sculptures), Holden (watercolors), Garcia (oil paintings), and Jiang (lithographs). 

Action: Answer("D") - Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The lecture topics are lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each lecturer lectures on a different topic.

  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs.
  
Analysis:
  - A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then the order of the lectures must be Farley, oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and this violates the rule that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  - B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then the order of the lectures must be Farley, Garcia, Holden, watercolors, and this violates the rule that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  - C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the lectures must be Farley, Holden, Garcia, watercolors, and the order of the lectures is sculptures, watercolors, lithographs, oil paintings, which satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, this choice is possible.
  - D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the lectures must be Farley, Holden, Garcia, watercolors, and the order of the lectures is sculptures, watercolors, lithographs, oil paintings, which satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, this choice is possible.
  - E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the order of the lectures must be Farley, Holden, Garcia, watercolors, and the order of the lectures is watercolors, sculptures, oil paintings, lithographs, which violates the rule that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Solution:
  From the given options, we need to find an acceptable assignment of photographers to the two graduation ceremonies.
  Let's evaluate each option:
  A: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together. But Mays is also assigned to the same ceremony which violates the constraint. So, this option is not acceptable.
  B: Knutson is assigned to Thorne University ceremony which means Heideck and Mays must also be assigned to it. But Mays is assigned to Silva University ceremony which violates the constraint. So, this option is not acceptable.
  C: Frost and Heideck are assigned to Silva University ceremony. Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University ceremony which means Lai must be assigned to Thorne University ceremony. Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University ceremony which means Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. This option satisfies all the constraints. So, this option is acceptable.
  D: Frost and Heideck are assigned to Thorne University ceremony which violates the constraint. So, this option is not acceptable.
  E: Frost and Heideck are assigned to Silva University ceremony which violates the constraint. So, this option is not acceptable.

  Therefore, the acceptable assignment of photographers to the two graduation ceremonies is Silva University: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, and Thorne University: Knutson, Lai, Mays.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are three botanists (F, G, and H), three chemists (K, L, and M), and three zoologists (P, Q, and R) available for selection.
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each type.
  If more than one botanist is selected, at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected. So, we have two cases to consider:
  Case 1: P and Q are selected, and R is not selected.
  Case 2: P and R are selected, and Q is not selected.
  
  Case 1:
    If P and Q are selected, then we have the following possible combinations:
    Botanist, Chemist, Zoologist
    F, K, P
    G, L, Q
    H, M, P
    H, L, Q
    We can see that if K is selected, then G cannot be selected. So, option A is true.
  
  Case 2:
    If P and R are selected, then we have the following possible combinations:
    Botanist, Chemist, Zoologist
    F, L, P
    F, M, P, R
    G, K, R
    H, K, P, R
    H, L, P, R
    We can see that none of the options B, C, D, or E are necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, then M cannot be selected, so P cannot be selected. This contradicts the given condition. Therefore, this option is not correct.
  B: If L is selected, then K and M cannot be selected. Therefore, at least one botanist will be selected. Since P is the only zoologist selected, either F or G must be selected. Therefore, this option is not correct.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, then it must be either K, L, or M. However, this option does not provide any information about P and the botanists. Therefore, this option is not correct.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then it must be any two of K, L, and M. If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, F cannot be selected. Therefore, this option is correct.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then it must be any two of K, L, and M. If G is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, G cannot be selected. Therefore, this option is also correct.

Action: Answer("D or E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - We know that P is the only zoologist selected.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then we must have at least one botanist and one chemist on the panel. Since F and K cannot both be selected, and we know that P is the only zoologist selected, the only way to satisfy the conditions is to select botanist H and chemist K. This means that exactly one chemist is selected, and it must be K. Therefore, choice C must be true.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected.

Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
- If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected, which means only one scientist of each type will be selected.
- If L is selected, then either K or M must be selected. If K is selected, then F cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected.
- None of the other choices can be deduced from the given information.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Action: Answer("D")

If P is the only zoologist selected, then there must be at least one botanist and at least one chemist selected. If F is selected, then K and M cannot be selected. Therefore, at most one chemist can be selected if F is selected. If exactly two chemists are selected, then F cannot be selected. Hence, if exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("B")

If P is the only zoologist selected, then there must be at least one botanist and one chemist selected. If F is selected as the botanist, then K and M cannot be selected. If K is not selected, then L must be selected as the only chemist. If L is selected, then F cannot be selected. Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected. So, the correct answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist and either K or L must be selected as a chemist. If K is selected, then G cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected. If L is selected, then F can still be selected. If M is not selected, then either P or R can be selected but not both. Therefore, we cannot conclude that exactly one chemist must be selected, or that F cannot be selected if exactly two chemists are selected, or that G cannot be selected if exactly two chemists are selected. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected.
  
Analysis:
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected. This means that if M is selected, then K must also be selected since the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. This also means that F cannot be selected since F and K cannot both be selected. 
  - Option A is incorrect because there is no direct relationship between K and G. 
  - Option B is incorrect because there is no direct relationship between L and F.
  - Option C is incorrect because it is not necessary to select K if exactly one chemist is selected. 
  - Option D is incorrect because it is possible to select F and two other chemists if exactly two chemists are selected. 
  - Option E is correct because if exactly two chemists are selected, and K is one of them, then G cannot be selected because F cannot be selected. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The panel must include at least one scientist from each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("D")

If P is the only zoologist selected, then there must be at least one botanist and one chemist, but at most one zoologist. This means that either F, G, or H must be selected, but only one of them. Also, either K, L, or M must be selected, but not both K and M together. 

Option A is not necessarily true because it is possible to select K and G together.
Option B is not necessarily true because it is possible to select L and F together.
Option C is not necessarily true because it is possible to select L and M together.
Option D is necessarily true because if exactly two chemists are selected, then one of them must be L, and the other one cannot be F because F is a botanist. 
Option E is not necessarily true because it is possible to select L and K together.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Since P is the only zoologist selected, we know that there must be at least one botanist and one chemist on the panel. We also know that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, we can conclude that only one botanist can be selected.

Let's go through each choice to see which one must be true:
A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  - There is no direct relationship between K and G, so this choice cannot be true.
B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  - There is no direct relationship between L and F, so this choice cannot be true.
C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  - This is not necessarily true. We know that there must be at least one chemist, but it could be any of the three chemists.
D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  - This is not necessarily true. We know that there must be at least one botanist and one chemist, but it is possible for F to be selected if only one botanist is selected and exactly two chemists are selected.
E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
  - This is true. If exactly two chemists are selected, and only one botanist is selected, then the two chemists must be K and L. In this case, G cannot be selected because of the rule that F and K cannot both be selected.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn were to work in the same sales zone as Parra, then there would be two sales representatives in that zone, and the remaining five sales representatives would have to be divided between the other two zones. However, the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 would be violated. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  
  A: Kim's sales zone is not mentioned and is not relevant to the question.
  B: Mahr's sales zone is not mentioned and is not relevant to the question.
  C: Stuckey and Quinn can work in the same sales zone, so this is not the correct answer.
  D: If Tiao were to work in the same sales zone as Quinn, then either Parra or Udall would have to work in Zone 2, and the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2 would be violated. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  E: Stuckey and Udall can work in the same sales zone, so this is not the correct answer.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then both of them will work in the same sales zone as Kim. This would mean that Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall would have to work in Zone 3, which would be four sales representatives in Zone 3, which is more than the number of sales representatives in Zone 2. However, we know that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra. 
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Tiao, then both of them will work in the same sales zone as Udall, which means that Parra, Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey would have to work in Zone 3, which would be five sales representatives in Zone 3, which is more than the number of sales representatives in Zone 2. However, we know that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then both of them will work in the same sales zone as Udall, which means that Parra, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao would have to work in Zone 3, which would be five sales representatives in Zone 3, which is more than the number of sales representatives in Zone 2. However, we know that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Udall, then Parra and Kim would have to work in Zone 1 and Tiao would have to work in Zone 2. This would mean that Mahr, Stuckey, and Quinn would have to work in Zone 3, which would be three sales representatives in Zone 3, which is less than the number of sales representatives in Zone 2. This is possible given the information we have.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3. This means that Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively. However, this would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, since there would be only one representative in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are 3 sales zones, and 7 sales representatives.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao is not in Zone 1, which means Tiao is in Zone 2, and Udall is not. 
  If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra is not in Zone 1, which means Parra is in Zone 2, and Udall is not.
  In either case, there is only one sales representative left who can be in Zone 1, and that is Kim.
  Therefore, Kim is in Zone 1, and Parra or Tiao is in Zone 2. The remaining 3 sales representatives are in Zone 3.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, there are only 3 possible configurations for the sales representatives:
  1) (Parra or Tiao) in Zone 2, Quinn and Parra in Zone 3, Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3, Kim and Mahr in Zone 3.
  2) (Parra or Tiao) in Zone 2, Quinn and Parra in Zone 3, Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3, Kim and Tiao in Zone 3.
  3) (Parra or Tiao) in Zone 1, Quinn and Parra in Zone 3, Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3, Kim and Mahr in Zone 3.
  In the first two configurations, Quinn is in Zone 3, so the answer cannot be C, D, or E.
  In the third configuration, Quinn is in the same sales zone as Parra, which means the answer cannot be A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Udall will also work in that sales zone, which means that Tiao will work in Zone 2 and Parra will work in Zone 1. This would leave only Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3, which contradicts the fact that there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim, which is choice A.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
To determine the answer, we need to find the sales representative that cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, we can eliminate choice A and B because they are not in the same sales zone as Parra. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, we can eliminate choice C and E because they are not in the same sales zone as Stuckey. Therefore, the answer is Tiao, which is the only remaining choice.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives that work in 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, we can infer that Quinn cannot work in Zone 1. Also, either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, so if Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao or Udall must also work in Zone 2, which would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn must work in Zone 3 along with Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao/Udall, and either Parra or Tiao. This means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, so the answer is C: Stuckey.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Since Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra and Parra works in either Zone 1 or Zone 3, it means Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao or Udall, who work in Zone 1 and Zone 2 respectively. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey. Therefore, the answer is C) Stuckey.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones (Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3).
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra, since they already work in the same zone.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 sales zones and 7 sales representatives. 
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with, we need to consider the conditions that limit the possibilities for each sales representative. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then Quinn cannot work in Zone 1. Since either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3, and Tiao must work in Zone 2. This leaves Kim, Mahr, and Udall to work in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Quinn must work in Zone 3. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as C: Stuckey.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
Choices:
  A: Julio, Nessa
  B: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  E: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  6. There are six lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. This means that Olivia's session is on Thursday afternoon, and since Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia, Lan's session must be on Thursday morning. This leaves the Wednesday sessions, which must be led by Julio, Kevin, and Rebecca.

  A: Julio cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  B: Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  C: Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  D: Julio and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  E: This is not a valid answer because it includes all six lab assistants, but there are only four sessions left to be led.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be held on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be held on Friday afternoon.
  The lab assistant who leads the Thursday afternoon session cannot be Lan or Olivia because they cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - There are 6 sessions, 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon, and each session is led by a different lab assistant.
  - If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon and Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon.
  
Analysis:
  - We need to find a lab assistant who can lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Kevin cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and her session is on Friday afternoon, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  - This leaves us with Lan, Olivia, and Rebecca as the possible lab assistants who can lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  - However, Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so if Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning and Lan's session must be on Friday morning.
  - Therefore, the only lab assistant who can lead the Thursday afternoon session is Rebecca.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session is on Thursday morning and Nessa's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia cannot lead Thursday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday, but not on Friday.
  Nessa must lead Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday.
  Rebecca must lead Thursday morning session with Kevin.
  Therefore, Julio and Lan cannot lead Thursday morning session.
  Julio cannot lead Friday session.
  
Analysis:
  Thursday afternoon session must be led by Nessa.
  Thursday morning session must be led by Kevin and Rebecca.
  Therefore, Julio, Lan, and Olivia cannot lead Thursday morning session.
  Julio's session must be on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Julio cannot lead Thursday morning session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead Thursday morning session.
  Therefore, Julio, Lan, and Olivia cannot lead Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Nessa must lead Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Julio, Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca could lead other sessions.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  6. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one on each of three days (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  
To determine who could lead the Thursday afternoon session, we need to consider the following:
  1. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the morning session on Thursday.
  2. If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin and Rebecca must be assigned to Wednesday sessions.
  3. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday morning, and Olivia's must be on Thursday or Friday afternoon.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday morning, and Olivia's must be on Thursday or Friday afternoon.

Based on the above, we can determine that:
  - Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on Wednesday (one in the morning and one in the afternoon).
  - Julio's session is on Wednesday or Thursday morning.
  - Lan's session is on Wednesday or Thursday morning.
  - Nessa's session is on Thursday or Friday afternoon.
  - Olivia's session is on Thursday or Friday afternoon, and it is not on Thursday if Julio's session is on Thursday morning.

Therefore, the only lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Nessa, so the answer is A: Julio, Nessa.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.

Reasoning: 
  Since Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon, neither of them can lead the Thursday afternoon session. 
  Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because Olivia's session must be on a later day than Lan's. 
  Therefore, Julio and Rebecca are the only lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  6. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one each day.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. This means that Olivia's session must be on Wednesday afternoon. By rule 4, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning. By rule 2, Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. This leaves only Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca who have not been assigned to a session yet. By rule 1, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they cannot both lead the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, Nessa is the only lab assistant who can lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants in total.
  There are six lab sessions in total, one each morning and one each afternoon on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session cannot be on Friday since there is no afternoon session on Saturday. Thus, Kevin's session must be on Thursday, and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  
  Therefore, Olivia and Lan cannot lead Thursday afternoon session, and Julio's session must be on Wednesday. This leaves Kevin, Rebecca, and Nessa as the only possible lab assistants to lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.

  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  The Thursday afternoon session cannot be led by Rebecca because she must lead a session on the same day as Kevin.
  The Thursday afternoon session cannot be led by Olivia or Lan because they cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  The Thursday afternoon session can be led by Julio or Nessa.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  The Thursday afternoon session cannot be led by Lan or Olivia.
  
Analysis: 
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Lan and Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so their sessions must be on Thursday. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday and Olivia's session must be on Friday. Thus, the lab assistants available to lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio, Nessa, and Lan.

  5. Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.

Let's consider the given options:
  A: If Wellspring performs in slot two, then Zircon and Xpert would have to perform in slots one and three, respectively. This would mean that Vegemite would have to perform in slot four, which would be later than Zircon, so this option is not possible.
  B: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Zircon and Xpert would have to perform in slots one and two, respectively. This means that Vegemite would have to perform in slot four and Yardsign would have to perform in slot five. This satisfies all the given constraints, so this option is possible.
  C: If Wellspring performs in slot four, then Zircon and Xpert would have to perform in slots two and three, respectively. This means that Vegemite would have to perform in slot one, which would be earlier than Zircon, so this option is not possible.
  D: If Wellspring performs in slot five, then Zircon and Xpert would have to perform in slots three and four, respectively. This means that Vegemite would have to perform in slot two, which would be earlier than Zircon, so this option is not possible.
  E: If Wellspring performs in slot six, then Zircon and Xpert would have to perform in slots four and five, respectively. This means that Vegemite would have to perform in slot three, which would be earlier than Zircon, so this option is not possible.

  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon cannot be in slot three and Yardsign cannot be in slot one.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  We know that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon must be in slot two and Yardsign must be in slot three. Therefore, Wellspring must be in slot four, since it performs in an earlier slot than Xpert, which means that Zircon also performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered slot one through slot six.
  - Six bands will perform in just one slot each.
  - Constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices would be: Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices would be: Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?. 
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the accomplices would be: Quinn, Rovero, ?, Peters, ?, ?, ?. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of the accomplices would be: Quinn, Rovero, ?, Peters, ?, Villas, White. 
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before Peters or immediately after White. The possible places for Stanton are: 
  1. First, before Quinn.
  2. Second, between Quinn and Rovero.
  3. Third, after Rovero and before Peters.
  4. Fifth, after Peters and before Villas.
  5. Seventh, after White.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot be recruited second, between Quinn and Rovero.
  
Action: Answer("B")

  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  A: If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of the accomplices must be: Stanton, ?, ?, Peters, Villas, White, ?. However, Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so this is not possible.
  B: If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of the accomplices must be: Quinn, Stanton, ?, Peters, Villas, White, ?. However, Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so this is not possible.
  C: If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of the accomplices must be: Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Peters, Villas, White, ?. This is possible.
  D: If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of the accomplices must be: Quinn, Rovero, ?, Peters, Villas, White, Stanton. However, this is not possible because Peters was recruited fourth.
  E: If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of the accomplices must be: Quinn, Rovero, ?, Peters, Villas, White, Stanton. However, this is not possible because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices must be: 
  1. Peters 
  2. Villas 
  3. White 
  4. Quinn 
  5. Rovero 
  6. Tao 
  7. Stanton
  
  Therefore, Stanton could not have been recruited third or fourth since he was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited fifth and Rovero sixth or Rovero fourth and Quinn third.
  If Quinn was recruited fifth and Rovero sixth, then Stanton must have been recruited first, second, or seventh.
  If Rovero was fourth and Quinn was third, then Stanton must have been recruited first, second, or seventh.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  2. Peters was recruited fourth.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is as follows:
  Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), (unknown), Villas, White, in which the unknowns are Tao and Stanton.
  Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, he cannot be recruited fifth, which means he cannot be recruited immediately after Rovero.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the recruits would be Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, and Stanton.
  
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited fifth, after Rovero and Tao.
  
  Answer: Answer("D") fifth.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the two would be: Q R _ _ _ _ _
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the two would be: Q R _ _ _ _ _
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order so far is: Q R _ P _ _ _
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order so far is: Q R V P W _ _
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so the order so far is: Q R V P W T S
  
Action: Answer("B")  
  Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Quinn was immediately before Rovero, it means Rovero was recruited fifth. Therefore, Stanton cannot have been recruited second.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be: [Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Stanton].
  
  Therefore, Stanton cannot have been recruited first, second, third, fifth, or seventh, but he could have been recruited fourth.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  2. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  3. Peters was recruited fourth.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices would be:
  1. Peters
  2. Villas
  3. White
  4. Quinn
  5. Rovero
  6. Tao
  7. Stanton
  
If Stanton was recruited first, second, third, or fifth, then he could have been recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. However, if Stanton was recruited seventh, then he must have been recruited immediately after Tao. This would contradict the statement that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Therefore, Stanton cannot have been recruited seventh.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be:
  Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White
  
  Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited either third or fifth.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  Each member performs exactly one solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

To determine the answer, we need to use the given restrictions to create a timeline of when each solo is performed. From the given information, we know that:
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
- The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
- The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
- The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter.

Using this information, we can create the following timeline:

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 

We know that each member performs exactly one solo, so we need to fill in each slot with a member's name. We also know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so we can eliminate that option for slot 4. 

1. 
2. 
3. 
   X
5. 
6. 

Next, we know that the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the percussionist's solo must come before the keyboard player's solo. We also know that the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so the violinist's solo must come before the keyboard player's solo, and the keyboard player's solo must come before the guitarist's solo. 

1. 
2. 
3. 
P  X
V  K
6. 

Finally, we know that the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. We also know that the percussionist performs before the saxophonist if the percussionist performs before the saxophonist. Therefore, the only option for the saxophonist's solo is to come after the percussionist's solo. 

1. 
2. 
3. 
P  X
V  K
   S

From this timeline, we can see that the percussionist performs the third solo. Therefore, the answer is B: The percussionist performs the second solo. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are six solos performed by six members of the band.
  Each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Solution:
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the following must be true:
  - The percussionist performs before the saxophonist.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  Since we don't know the order of the solos, we can use the given information to eliminate some choices:
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so A and B are not necessarily true.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does, so E is not necessarily true.
  - We don't know the order of the violinist's solo and the saxophonist's solo, so C is not necessarily true.
  The only choice that must be true is:
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six members in the band and each one performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  - We are told that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  
Analysis:
  - If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist, then we know that the saxophonist must perform either the fifth or the sixth solo.
  - The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so the only possible options for the fourth solo are the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  - Since the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then the percussionist cannot perform the fifth solo, which means the percussionist must perform the second solo.
  - The violinist performs before the keyboard player, so the violinist must perform either the first or the second solo.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both, so the saxophonist must perform either the fifth or the sixth solo.
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is that the percussionist performs the second solo.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To find the answer, we need to use the given information to create a timeline of the solos.

Timeline:
1  2  3  4  5  6
P  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?
V  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?
T/S?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?
K  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

From the given information, we know that:
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitarist performs either the first, second, or third solo.
- The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. Therefore, the percussionist performs either the first or second solo.
- The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player performs either the third or fourth solo.
- The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist performs either the fifth or sixth solo.

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform the sixth solo. Therefore, the timeline looks like this:

Timeline:
1  2  3  4  5  6
P  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?
V  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?
T  ?  ?  ?  ?  S
K  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

From the given information, we know that:
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitarist performs either the first or second solo.
- The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. Therefore, the percussionist performs the first solo.
- The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player performs the third solo.
- The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the trumpeter performs the fifth solo.

Therefore, the answer is that the percussionist performs the first solo. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Each of the six members of the band performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, it means that the saxophonist will perform a solo at some time after the percussionist does. The saxophonist will not perform a solo after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. Hence, the correct answer is D.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, it means the saxophonist is not the first or the second to perform.
  
  A: It is not necessarily true that the percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: It is not necessarily true that the percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: It is not necessarily true that the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: It is not necessarily true that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: It is not necessarily true that the saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band: guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, and violinist.
  Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform the fifth or sixth solo.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time before the guitarist does, so the guitarist must perform the sixth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, so the keyboard player must perform the third solo.
  The violinist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, so the violinist must perform the first or second solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Since the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, the saxophonist must perform after the trumpeter does.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - A six-member band performs exactly one solo each during a concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist does. Therefore, the saxophonist does not perform the first solo. Since the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, the guitarist performs the fifth solo. The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player performs the third solo. The remaining solo is performed by the trumpeter or the saxophonist. However, the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the six band members performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: 
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then we can deduce the following:
  - The percussionist's solo must come before the saxophonist's solo.
  - The saxophonist's solo must come after either the percussionist's solo or the trumpeter's solo, but not both.
  - Therefore, the percussionist's solo must come before the trumpeter's solo.
  - The keyboard player's solo must come after the violinist's solo and before the guitarist's solo.
  - The guitarist's solo cannot be the fourth solo.
  
  Given these restrictions, we can determine that the percussionist's solo must be the first solo. This is because the percussionist's solo must come before the saxophonist's solo, and the saxophonist's solo cannot be the first solo because it must come after either the percussionist's solo or the trumpeter's solo, but not both. Therefore, choices A and B are incorrect.
  
  Choice C is not necessarily true, as the violinist's solo could come after the saxophonist's solo.
  
  Choice D is true, as we have already determined that the percussionist's solo must come before the trumpeter's solo.
  
  Choice E is not necessarily true, as the saxophonist's solo could come after the keyboard player's solo.
  
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member of the six-member band performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: 
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then:
  - The percussionist cannot perform the last solo because the saxophonist must perform a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter does.
  - Therefore, the saxophonist must perform the last solo.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Since the saxophonist performs the last solo, the keyboard player must perform the fifth solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist performs the first solo or the second solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does, so the percussionist performs the second solo.
  - Therefore, the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  
Therefore, the answer is D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has two paintings - one oil and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Using the given conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2 because Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Franz's oil must be on either wall 1 or 3.
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, so the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's oil or watercolor.
  - No wall can have only watercolors, so the other painting on wall 2 must be an oil painting.
  - No wall can have only paintings by one student, so the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's watercolor.
  - No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, so the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Isaacs's watercolor or oil.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, the only painting that could also be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  Franz and Isaacs do not have any paintings displayed on the same wall.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  
Reasoning: 
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on that wall must be a watercolor. 
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2. 
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on wall 2. 
  Therefore, the only possible option is Greene's oil, which must be displayed with a watercolor on wall 2.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Four students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs - will display exactly two paintings each.
  2. Each wall will display exactly two paintings - one oil and one watercolor.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then:
  1. Wall 2 already has one oil painting, so the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor.
  2. Wall 2 cannot have only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. Wall 2 cannot have both paintings by Hidalgo displayed on it.
  4. Wall 2 cannot have both paintings by Franz displayed on it.
  5. Wall 2 cannot have both paintings by Isaacs displayed on it.
  
  Therefore, the only option that could be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil, as it is the only remaining option that has not been eliminated by the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  Franz and Isaacs cannot have paintings displayed on the same wall.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then it is not possible for Isaacs or Franz to have a painting displayed on wall 2. Therefore, it must be either Greene's oil or watercolor. However, if Greene's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Franz's oil must be displayed on wall 1, and this would mean that wall 1 has only watercolors displayed on it, which is not allowed. Therefore, the only possible option is that Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  4 art students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, Isaacs) each display 2 paintings (oil, watercolor) on 4 walls (1, 2, 3, 4) with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the upper position of wall 2 must have a painting that is not a watercolor and is not painted by Hidalgo. 
  The only painting that meets this condition is Greene's watercolor, which is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. 
  Therefore, Greene's watercolor could also be displayed on wall 2.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the paintings displayed on wall 2 are Hidalgo's oil and another painting.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting displayed on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's watercolor. 
  Also, since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, then the other painting displayed on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's other painting.
  Therefore, the other painting displayed on wall 2 must be one of the paintings by the other two students, Franz or Greene.
  However, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, and since wall 2 is not the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then the other painting displayed on wall 2 cannot be Greene's watercolor. 
  Therefore, the other painting displayed on wall 2 must be Franz's oil or Greene's oil or Isaacs's watercolor.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly 2 paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then:
  - Wall 2 has Hidalgo's oil and one other painting.
  - The other painting cannot be Hidalgo's watercolor, because no wall can have only watercolors.
  - The other painting cannot be painted by Franz or Isaacs, because no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it and no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - The other painting must be painted by Greene, because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Therefore, the possible painting that could be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  3. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  5. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  6. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we know that:
  - Wall 2 has at least one oil painting.
  - Wall 2 has at least one painting by Hidalgo.
  - Wall 2 cannot have a painting by Franz or Isaacs.
  - Wall 2 cannot have only watercolors.
  - Wall 2 cannot have only one student's work.
  
  A: Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 because of condition 3.
  B: Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because it is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed (condition 4).
  C: Greene's oil could be displayed on wall 2, but it is not guaranteed because there are still two other paintings that need to be placed on wall 2 and we don't know their positions yet.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because no wall can have only watercolors (condition 1).
  E: Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because we know that wall 2 has at least one oil painting (which is Hidalgo's oil) and no wall can have only one student's work (condition 2).
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  Franz and Isaacs cannot be on the same wall.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we cannot have Isaacs on wall 2 since his oil is displayed on wall 4. Therefore, we know that Hidalgo's watercolor must be on wall 2. Since no wall can have only watercolors, we know that there must be an oil painting on wall 2. Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2 because he cannot share a wall with Isaacs. Greene's oil cannot be on wall 2 because his watercolor is on the wall with Franz's oil. Therefore, the only option left is Greene's watercolor. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Each student displays exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. Each wall has two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  8. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.

Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting displayed on wall 2 must satisfy the following conditions:
  1. It must be a watercolor.
  2. It must not be painted by Hidalgo.
  3. It must not be painted by Franz or Isaacs.
  4. It must be displayed in the lower position of wall 2, since Hidalgo's oil is displayed in the upper position of wall 2.

Action: Answer("E")  
  Isaacs's watercolor could be displayed on wall 2, since it is a watercolor, it is not painted by Hidalgo, Franz, or Greene, and it is displayed in the lower position of wall 2.

  - If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be in bay 3 or bay 5. If the bay holding textiles is in bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be in bay 5, which is not possible because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, the bay holding textiles must be in bay 5, which means the bay holding livestock must be in bay 3. This satisfies all the given conditions, so B could be true.
  - If bay 4 is holding textiles, then the bay holding produce must be in bay 3 or bay 5. If the bay holding produce is in bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be in bay 5, which is not possible because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, the bay holding produce must be in bay 5, which means the bay holding livestock must be in bay 3. This satisfies all the given conditions, so C could be true.
  - If bay 5 is holding grain, then the bay holding livestock must be in bay 4, which is not possible because the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, D is not true.
  - If bay 5 is holding machinery, then the bay holding livestock must be in bay 4, which is not possible because the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, E is not true.

Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must begin before the sci-fi film. 
  The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot be shown on screen 1.
  Therefore, the horror film is shown on screen 2 and the mystery is shown on screen 3.
  Since the western begins before the horror film does, the western cannot begin at 9 P.M. on screen 2.
  Therefore, the western begins at 7 P.M. on screen 1 and the sci-fi film begins at 9 P.M. on screen 2.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are 5 movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screen 1 and 2 show 2 movies each at 7 PM and 9 PM.

  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possible screens for them to be shown on are screen 1 or 2.
  If the western begins before the horror film, and the western and the sci-fi film are on the same screen, then the sci-fi film must begin after the western.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the horror film cannot be shown on the same screen as the western and the sci-fi film.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it cannot be shown on the same screen as the western and the sci-fi film.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that the mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:

  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Solution:
  - If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only screen they can be shown on is screen 1 or 2.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 3.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2 along with the western.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 or 2 with the western and the sci-fi film.
  - Therefore, the only possible schedule is: 
    - Screen 1 (7 P.M.): Western and Sci-fi
    - Screen 2 (9 P.M.): Horror and Mystery
    - Screen 3 (8 P.M.): Romance
  - From this schedule, we can see that the mystery begins at 9 P.M.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen, then the horror and mystery films must be shown on screen 3. The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 3. The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2. Since the western must begin before the horror film, it cannot begin at 9 P.M., so it must begin at 7 P.M. This means that the mystery must begin at 9 P.M., which is possible according to the conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - There are three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.

  - If the western is shown on screen 1 or 2, then the horror film will be shown on the other screen, because the western begins before the horror film.
  - The mystery cannot be shown on screen 2, because the romance is not shown on screen 2, and the horror and mystery are shown on different screens.
  - If the western and sci-fi film are shown on screen 1, then the horror film will be shown on screen 2, and the romance will be shown on screen 3.
  - If the western and sci-fi film are shown on screen 2, then the horror film will be shown on screen 1, and the mystery will be shown on screen 3.
  - The sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M., because both movies on screens 1 and 2 begin at 7 P.M.
  
Action: Answer("C")

If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only option that could be true is that the horror film is shown on screen 2. This is because the western movie must begin before the horror movie, and the sci-fi movie cannot be on screen 3. Therefore, the western movie and the sci-fi movie must be on either screen 1 or 2. If the western and sci-fi movies are on screen 1, then the horror movie must be on screen 2. If the western and sci-fi movies are on screen 2, then the horror movie must be on screen 1. The other options are not necessarily true and could be false based on the constraints given.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Action: Answer("C")

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf, and L must be on the top or middle shelf. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the middle shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, G must be on the middle shelf. Therefore, H and M must be placed on the same shelf, which is the bottom shelf. Thus, the answer is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then we know that L and H are not on the same shelf. Also, we know that H is not on the top shelf because there are at least two books on each shelf. Therefore, H is either on the middle shelf or the bottom shelf.

If H is on the middle shelf, then I (which must be on the middle shelf) would be on the same shelf as H, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, H must be on the bottom shelf.

If L is on a higher shelf than H, then L must be on the top shelf and H must be on the bottom shelf.

Now, we know that F and M are on the same shelf, and K and O are on different shelves. Therefore, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("E") K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - If L is on the middle shelf, then F and M must also be on the middle shelf, which means K and O must be on the bottom shelf, and G and H must be on the top shelf. This would make (B) true.
  - If L is on the top shelf, then F and M must also be on the top shelf, which means K and O must be on the middle or top shelf, and G and H must be on the bottom shelf. This would make (C) true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  
Analysis:
  - If L is placed on a shelf higher than H, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - If L is on the top shelf, then O must be on the top shelf, which contradicts the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf.
  - If L is on the middle shelf, then O must be on the top shelf, which means K must be on the middle shelf and F must be on the bottom shelf. Also, G and H must be on the bottom shelf, so B is true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books on each shelf.
  - More books on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then it means that L is either on the top or middle shelf and H is on the bottom shelf. Therefore:
  - F and M are also on the same shelf as each other because F is on the same shelf as M.
  - I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the same shelf as G or H.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K is either on the top or middle shelf.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O is either on the top or middle shelf.
  
Looking at the answer choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other. - Not necessarily true.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. - Not necessarily true.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. - Not necessarily true.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other. - Not possible since I is on the middle shelf.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other. - Not necessarily true.
  
Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and F is not on the top shelf, then M must also not be on the top shelf. Therefore, M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. This means that the top shelf must contain only one book, which can only be either G or I. Since I is already on the middle shelf, then G must be on the top shelf. This means that F and K are on the bottom shelf and O is on the middle shelf. 
  
  A: We know that F is on the same shelf as M, but we don't know if G is on the same shelf as F.
  B: We don't know if G and H are on the same shelf as each other.
  C: We know that H is on the top shelf and M is not, but we don't know if they are on the same shelf as each other.
  D: We know that I is on the middle shelf, but we don't know if G is on the same shelf as I.
  E: We know that K is on the bottom shelf and O is on the middle shelf, but we don't know if they are on the same shelf as each other.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If L is placed on a shelf higher than H, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - If L is on the top shelf, then O must also be on the top shelf, which violates the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf.
  - If L is on the middle shelf, then F and M must also be on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the bottom shelf.
  - G, H, and I must be on the bottom shelf or the middle shelf.
  - O must be on the top shelf.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and there are only two shelves left, F and M must be on the bottom shelf together. Therefore, K must be on the top shelf, and G and H must be on the middle shelf together. Thus, the answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) are placed on a bookcase with exactly 3 shelves.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then F and K must be placed on the same shelf as each other. This is because K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and L is placed on a higher shelf than H. Therefore, to satisfy the condition that at least two books are placed on each shelf, F and K must be placed on the same shelf. 
  
  A: We do not know whether F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: We do not know whether G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: We do not know whether H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: We do not know whether I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: We do not know whether K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  
If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. This means that O must be on the bottom shelf, K must be on the middle shelf, and I must be on the middle shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, then they must be on the top shelf. This leaves G and H to be placed on the same shelf as each other on the middle shelf.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: The assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  E: Xu is assigned parking space #5.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees and six parking spaces.
  Each employee must be assigned to a different parking space.
  Young > Togowa
  Xu > Souza
  Robertson > Young
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  If Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. This means that Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Togowa is assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #4, #5, or #6, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. If Togowa is assigned parking space #5, then Young must be assigned parking space #6, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #6 and Young must be assigned parking space #5. This leaves only one possible parking space for Xu and Souza, and only one possible parking space for Vaughn. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: 
    Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    
A: If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Xu must be assigned parking space #2 or higher, which means that Young must be assigned parking space #3 or higher, which means that Robertson must be assigned parking space #4 or higher. However, we know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so this assignment is not fully and uniquely determined. 

B: If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, which means that Robertson must be assigned parking space #4 or higher. However, we know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so this assignment is not fully and uniquely determined. 

C: If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, which means that Robertson must be assigned parking space #4 or higher. However, we know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so this assignment is not fully and uniquely determined. 

D: If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, Young must be assigned parking space #2, Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or higher, and Souza must be assigned parking space #6. This assignment satisfies all of the given rules and is therefore fully and uniquely determined. 

E: If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1 or #2, which means that Young must be assigned parking space #3 or higher, which means that Robertson must be assigned parking space #4 or higher. However, we know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so this assignment is not fully and uniquely determined.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Six employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young) must be assigned one of six parking spaces (#1-#6).
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so we can start by assigning him to one of these spaces.
  - If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Robertson, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #1.
  - If Robertson is assigned parking space #2, then Young must be assigned parking space #3, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #1. This leaves Souza, Vaughn, and Xu to be assigned parking spaces #4, #5, and #6. We know that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #5 and Souza must be assigned parking space #4. Finally, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #6. Therefore, if Robertson is assigned parking space #2, then the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined.
  - If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4 or #5, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #3.
  - If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, and Souza, Vaughn, and Xu must be assigned parking spaces #2, #3, and #6 (in some order). However, we know that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which violates the assignment of parking spaces in this scenario. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #4.
  - If Robertson is assigned parking space #5 or #6, then the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young is violated. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  2. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  3. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  4. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  5. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  6. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  7. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
  From rule 7, Robertson must be assigned either parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. From rule 6, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned either parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. From rule 5, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Xu cannot be assigned a higher-numbered parking space, so Souza cannot be assigned parking space #1. If Souza is assigned parking space #2, then Xu must be assigned either parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6. If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Vaughn must be assigned parking space #6, but Young cannot be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #5. If Xu is assigned parking space #6, then Vaughn must be assigned parking space #5, and Young must be assigned parking space #4, which violates rule 6. Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #6. If Xu is assigned parking space #3, then Souza must be assigned parking space #2, and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #1. Young must be assigned either parking space #4, #5, or #6. However, if Young is assigned parking space #4, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #5, which violates rule 4. Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #4. If Young is assigned parking space #5, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #6, and the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined. Therefore, the answer is E.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
    * Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    * Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    * Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    * Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: The assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if which one of the following is true?
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #1. - This is not enough information to uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2. - This is not enough information to uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3. - This is not enough information to uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces.
  D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4. - This is enough information to uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces. If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Togowa must be assigned parking space #6, Xu must be assigned parking space #3, and Souza must be assigned parking space #2.
  E: Xu is assigned parking space #5. - This is not enough information to uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees and six parking spaces.
  Each employee must be assigned a different parking space.
  The assignment rules are:
    - Young > Togowa
    - Xu > Souza
    - Robertson > Young
    - Robertson in {1, 2, 3, 4}
    
Analysis:
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6. This means that Souza must be assigned parking space #2 and Xu must be assigned parking space #3. Finally, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #1. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Solution:
  From the rules, we know that Robertson must be assigned to parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Robertson were assigned to parking space #1, then Young would have to be assigned to parking space #2, which would mean that Togowa would have to be assigned to parking space #3, which would leave Xu with parking spaces #4, #5, and #6 to choose from, violating the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned to parking space #1. Similarly, we can eliminate parking space #2 for Robertson, since that would require Young to be assigned parking space #3, which would leave Togowa with parking space #4, which would leave Xu with parking spaces #5 and #6 to choose from, again violating the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. If Robertson were assigned to parking space #3, then Young would have to be assigned to parking space #4, which would leave Togowa with parking space #5 and Xu with parking space #6, satisfying all the rules. Therefore, we can determine the unique assignment of parking spaces as follows:
  Robertson: #3
  Young: #4
  Togowa: #5
  Xu: #6
  Souza: #2
  Vaughn: #1

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Solution:
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  - Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  - If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #2. This leaves Togowa with parking space #4. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined if Souza is assigned parking space #1.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The rules governing the assignment of parking spaces are:
- Young > Togowa
- Xu > Souza
- Robertson > Young
- Robertson = 1, 2, 3, or 4
- Each employee must be assigned a different parking space.

Analysis:
- Since Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and no two employees can be assigned the same parking space, Robertson can't be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
- Since Robertson > Young, and Robertson can't be assigned parking space #5 or #6, then Young can't be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, or #5.
- Since Xu > Souza, and Young can't be assigned parking space #1 or #2, then Xu must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- Since Young > Togowa, and Young can't be assigned parking space #1 or #2, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
- Since no two employees can be assigned the same parking space, and Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
- Since no two employees can be assigned the same parking space, and we have already assigned parking spaces to Robertson, Young, Xu, and Togowa, then Souza and Vaughn must be assigned parking spaces #5 and #6 in some order.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types - botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Solution:
If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or else K. 
If neither F nor K is selected, then the panel will have 2 botanists (G and H) and 3 zoologists (P, Q, and R). 
Since more than one botanist is selected, at most one zoologist is selected. But we have three zoologists, so this is not possible. 
Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K.
Option A includes F or K, so it is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
To consider the given question, we need to examine the different possibilities that arise when both G and H are selected. 

If both G and H are selected, then we must select one more botanist, one more chemist, and one more zoologist. We cannot select both F and K, and we cannot select both K and M. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.

Let's consider the choices:
A: F or else K - This choice is not necessarily true. We could select G, H, F, L, P, and Q.
B: F or else M - This choice is not necessarily true. We could select G, H, K, L, P, and Q.
C: K or else M - This choice is not necessarily true. We could select G, H, F, L, P, and Q.
D: M or else Q - This choice is not necessarily true. We could select G, H, F, L, P, and R.
E: P or else Q - This choice is necessarily true. If we select G, H, and one of F/K, we must select both P and Q to satisfy the requirement of selecting at least one scientist of each type.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
To satisfy the condition that both G and H are among the scientists selected, the panel must be composed of:
  - at least one botanist (F, G, or H)
  - at least one chemist (K, L, or M)
  - at least one zoologist (P, Q, or R)
  
If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel can be composed of:
  - G, H, and any other scientist that satisfies the conditions
  
Option A violates the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.
Option B violates the condition that K and M cannot both be selected.
Option C is possible, but it is not a necessary condition.
Option D is not possible, because if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Option E is possible, but it is not a necessary condition.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so there must be at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist on the panel.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Solution:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we can assume that the panel includes one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If we select F, then we have one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist, and we satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If we select K, then we have two chemists and one botanist, but we do not have a zoologist. This violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so we cannot select K.
  If we select M, then we have two chemists and one botanist, but we do not have a zoologist. This violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so we cannot select M.
  Therefore, we must select F. 
  The panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist, so we must select either K or M to be the second chemist. 
  However, K and M cannot both be selected, so we must select either K or M, but not both. 
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Solution:
  If both G and H are selected, then we need to consider the possible combinations of the remaining scientists. 
  - If we select F, we cannot select any other botanist, so we need to select one zoologist from P, Q, and R. This will give us two zoologists, which is not allowed. 
  - If we select K, we cannot select F, so we need to select one botanist from F and H, and one zoologist from P, Q, and R. This will give us one botanist and two zoologists, which is allowed. 
  - If we select L, we need to select one botanist from F and H, and one zoologist from P, Q, and R. This will give us one botanist and two zoologists, which is allowed. 
  - If we select M, we need to select both P and R, and one botanist from F and H. This will give us one botanist and two zoologists, which is allowed. 
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are selected, then at least one botanist is selected. 
  If one botanist is selected, then the other two scientists must be one chemist and one zoologist.
  K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, if G and H are selected, then the botanist must be either F or K.
  If F is selected, then a chemist and a zoologist must be selected, but both K and M are ruled out. Therefore, M is not selected. 
  If K is selected, then a chemist and a zoologist must be selected, and M is ruled out. Therefore, M is not selected. 
  In either case, M is not selected, and the panel must include either F or else K.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Solution:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then we have to select at least one botanist from G and H. If we select G and H, then we can select either K or M as the chemist. If we select M, then both P and R must be selected as zoologists. However, K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, we must select F as the botanist. In this case, we can select G and H as the other two scientists, and we can select either K or M as the chemist. If we select M, then both P and R must be selected as zoologists. Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K.
  Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and at least one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then K must be selected to satisfy the condition that at least one botanist is selected.
  If M is not selected, then P and R cannot both be selected, which violates the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, then M must be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, the panel must include F or K to satisfy the condition that at least one botanist is selected.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so there must be at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist on the panel.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. So, if there are two botanists, there can be at most one zoologist.
  F and K cannot both be selected. So, if one is selected, the other cannot be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected. So, if one is selected, the other cannot be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. So, if M is selected, P and R must also be selected.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we know that there will be at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist on the panel. 

If F is not selected, then we can select G and H along with any two other scientists. This would satisfy all of the conditions, so F is not necessary. 

If K is not selected, then we can select G and H along with any two other scientists. This would satisfy all of the conditions, so K is not necessary.

If M is not selected, then we can select G and H along with any two other scientists. This would satisfy all of the conditions, so M is not necessary.

If both F and K are not selected, then we can select G and H along with any two other scientists. This would satisfy all of the conditions, so either F or K is not necessary. 

However, if F is not selected and K is selected, then we cannot select any zoologists because there would be two botanists. This would violate the second condition, so F and K cannot both be excluded. 

Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or else K. Answer is A.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If G and H are selected, then F cannot be selected since there can be at most one botanist if more than one botanist is selected.
  If G and H are selected, then K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If G and H are selected, then F cannot be selected since there can be at most one botanist if more than one botanist is selected. However, we still need to have at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. Therefore, we must select either K or M as the chemist. If we select K, then we cannot select F. If we select M, then we must select both P and R. Therefore, the panel must include either F or else M.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we can eliminate options A and B, which only have one representative in Zone 3. 
  Option C has both Parra and Quinn working in the same sales zone, but we don't know which zone that is. It is possible that they work in Zone 3, but we cannot be sure.
  Option D has three representatives in Zone 3, which is possible given the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. However, we don't know if Tiao and Udall work in different zones or the same zone.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
  Option E has all four representatives, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall, working in Zone 3. This is possible given the conditions provided, and we can be sure that this is a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The company employs seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The company has three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  We need to find a list of sales representatives working in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we know that at least three sales representatives work in Zone 3. 

  Let's consider each option:
  A: Kim and Mahr are not mentioned in any of the given conditions, so we cannot determine if they work in Zone 3. Eliminate.
  B: Kim and Tiao are mentioned, but we cannot determine the third sales representative working in Zone 3. Eliminate.
  C: Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, but we cannot determine if they work in Zone 3. Eliminate.
  D: Tiao and Udall work in Zone 2, and Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall. This means that Tiao, Udall, and Stuckey cannot work in Zone 3, as there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Eliminate.
  E: Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. This means that at least four sales representatives work in the same sales zone, which can only be Zone 3. Therefore, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall work in Zone 3. Keep.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The company employs seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, we can conclude that Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey work in Zone 3. Additionally, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, the only possible answer choice is E, which includes Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:

  The representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  A: Kim and Mahr are not mentioned as working in Zone 3.
  B: Tiao is already assigned to Zone 2, so the list cannot be complete and accurate.
  C: Parra and Quinn are both mentioned as working in the same sales zone, but it is not specified which zone that is.
  D: Stuckey and Udall are both mentioned as working in the same sales zone, and Tiao is assigned to Zone 2, so this could be a complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  E: This list includes all seven sales representatives and is therefore not a list of sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, neither Parra nor Udall can work in Zone 3. We also know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than Zone 2. Therefore, there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3. The only option that satisfies these conditions is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs seven sales representatives - Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The sales representatives are divided into three sales zones - Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, the remaining sales representatives, Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey, must work in Zone 3. We also know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so it must be the case that at least 3 sales representatives work in Zone 3. 
  
  A: Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3 because we know that at least 3 sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  B: Kim and Tiao cannot work in Zone 3 because Tiao works in either Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  C: Parra and Quinn cannot work in Zone 3 because they work in the same sales zone as each other.
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall cannot work in Zone 3 because Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, and only sales representatives Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey can work in Zone 3.
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall could all work in Zone 3. This satisfies the condition that there are at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3, and it is consistent with the other conditions given.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Using the given conditions, we can deduce that:
  - Neither Parra nor Tiao works in Zone 3, as they are both assigned to either Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  - Udall cannot be in Zone 3, as he is assigned to Zone 2.
  - Stuckey cannot be in Zone 1, as Udall and Stuckey work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 3, as they work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Tiao cannot be in Zone 1, as Parra and Tiao cannot both be in the same zone.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Therefore, the only possible option is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs seven sales representatives to work in three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  From the given choices, A, B, and C are not possible because they only have two sales representatives, and it is stated that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  D is not possible because Stuckey and Udall cannot both work in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
The complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 could be Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  2. Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  5. More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  From conditions 1 and 2, we know that Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 and Udall cannot work in Zone 1 or Zone 3. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1, Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3.
  From condition 5, we know that there are at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  From condition 4, we know that Stuckey works in Zone 3.
  From condition 3, we know that Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, so Quinn also works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao must work in Zone 3, but we need at least one more sales representative to satisfy condition 5. Parra and Quinn cannot work in Zone 3 because they work in Zone 1. Therefore, the only option that could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, neither Parra nor Udall can work in Zone 3. This means that Stuckey must work in Zone 3. Also, since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least two sales representatives in Zone 3. From the given conditions, we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Udall must also work in Zone 3. This leaves at least one more sales representative to work in Zone 3. Kim, Mahr, Parra, and Quinn are the only sales representatives left, but we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, neither Parra nor Quinn can work in Zone 3. This leaves Kim and Mahr as the only possible sales representatives to work in Zone 3.

To answer the question, we need to check which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.

Analysis:
If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we know that:
  - The first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday.
  - The third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Wednesday or Friday.

A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (This statement is true because there are nine batches of cookies in total, and each batch is made on a different day.)
B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (This statement is true because there are three batches of each kind of cookie, and we know that one of the batches is made on Wednesday.)
C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (This statement is false because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and we already established that one kind of cookie's first batch is made on Monday.)
D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (This statement is true because there are three batches of each kind of cookie, and we know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.)

  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Analysis:
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then either oatmeal's first batch is made on Thursday or sugar's first batch is made on Monday.
  - If oatmeal's first batch is made on Thursday, then peanut butter's first batch is made on Wednesday and sugar's first batch is made on Friday.
  - If sugar's first batch is made on Monday, then peanut butter's first batch is made on Wednesday and oatmeal's first batch is made on Thursday.
  - Let's check each statement:
    - A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True, given the conditions.)
    - B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (True, since peanut butter's first batch is made on Wednesday, and there are three batches of each kind of cookie.)
    - C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False, since if sugar's first batch is made on Monday, then oatmeal's first batch is also made on Monday.)
    - D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (True, since there are three batches of each kind of cookie, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.)
    - E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (False, since if sugar's first batch is made on Monday, then sugar's second batch is made on Thursday and sugar's third batch must be made on Friday.)

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookie: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the possible pairs of batches are:
    1. oatmeal's 1st batch and sugar's 3rd batch
    2. peanut butter's 1st batch and oatmeal's 3rd batch
    3. sugar's 1st batch and peanut butter's 3rd batch
  - For each of these pairs, we can determine which day(s) they are made on and use that information to evaluate the answer choices.
  - We can use the given information to determine the possible batches for each day of the week:
    - Monday: oatmeal (1st), peanut butter (2nd), sugar (3rd)
    - Tuesday: peanut butter (3rd), sugar (1st), oatmeal (2nd)
    - Wednesday: sugar (2nd), oatmeal (3rd), peanut butter (1st)
    - Thursday: oatmeal (2nd), peanut butter (3rd), sugar (2nd)
    - Friday: peanut butter (1st), sugar (3rd), oatmeal (1st)
    
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  - If oatmeal's 1st batch and sugar's 3rd batch are made on the same day, then they are both made on Monday.
  - If peanut butter's 1st batch and oatmeal's 3rd batch are made on the same day, then they are both made on Thursday.
  - If sugar's 1st batch and peanut butter's 3rd batch are made on the same day, then they are both made on Wednesday.
  - If oatmeal's 1st batch and sugar's 3rd batch are made on the same day, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Tuesday, which means that exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday is false. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week from Monday to Friday.
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("D")

If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, it means that the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Tuesday, and the third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Tuesday. This implies that exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. Therefore, (D) could be false, but the others are still true.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we know that the first batch of one kind of cookie and the third batch of another kind of cookie are made on the same day. 
  We also know that each kind of cookie is made in three batches, so if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then there are only two possibilities:
  1. The first batch of one kind of cookie and the third batch of another kind of cookie are both made on Monday.
  2. The first batch of one kind of cookie and the third batch of another kind of cookie are both made on Wednesday.
  Based on these possibilities, we can eliminate some choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - This is true based on the information given.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - This is true based on the information given.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - This could be false if the first batch of one kind of cookie and the third batch of another kind of cookie are both made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - This is true based on the information given.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - This is true based on the information given.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Analysis:
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the following must be true:
    1. The first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
    2. The third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Wednesday or Friday.
    3. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
    4. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  From 1 and 3, we can infer that the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday or Tuesday.
  If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday, then the third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Wednesday.
  If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Tuesday, then the third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Friday.
  In both cases, we can see that exactly two batches of cookies are made on the day that is not Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday.
  Therefore, the answer is B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. This could be false if both batches of cookies made on Wednesday are of the same kind.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then:
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Tuesday or Wednesday, and the third batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Monday or Friday.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies is not made on Monday or Friday, and the third batch of peanut butter cookies is not made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - The first batch of sugar cookies is not made on Monday or Tuesday, and the third batch of sugar cookies is not made on Wednesday or Friday.
  
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. This is true, since three batches of cookies are made each day.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. This is true, since the first batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies are both made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. This is false, since we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. This is false, since we know the first batch of sugar cookies is not made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. This is true, since we know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday and each kind of cookie has three batches, so the last batch of each kind of cookie must be made on Friday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
Choices:
  A: Quinn
  B: Ruiz
  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member either. This means that the three selected workers must be from the group {Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, Xue}. 
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. This means that the three selected workers must be from the group {Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, Xue}.
  If Quinn is selected as the project leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member. This means that the three selected workers must be from the group {Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, Xue} and include either Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader.
  If Quinn is not selected as the project leader, then Ruiz cannot be a project member. This means that the three selected workers must be from the group {Smith, Taylor, Wells, Xue} and include either Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader.
  Therefore, the only worker who must be a project member is either Quinn or Ruiz, depending on who is selected as the project leader.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either. 
  Therefore, Wells must be a project member, and neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member because if Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. 
  Therefore, the project will have to be composed of three members from the following four workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, and Wells.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, both Quinn and Xue must be project members, but only one of them can be the project leader. Therefore, Wells cannot be the project leader.
  If Wells is not a project member, then either Ruiz or Verma must be a project member. But, if either Ruiz or Verma is a project member, then that person must be the project leader. Therefore, both Quinn and Xue must be project members, but only one of them can be the project leader.
  In both cases, Quinn or Xue must be a project member and the project leader. Therefore, Answer("A") Quinn must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members and one project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member either because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, the three project members must be selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, the project leader must be selected from Quinn, Smith, or Xue. Since Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project, and Ruiz cannot be a project member, then Quinn must be the project leader. Therefore, the three project members must be Smith, Wells, and Quinn.
  If Wells is not a project member, then the project leader must be selected from Quinn, Ruiz, or Xue. Since Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project, and Taylor is not a project member, then neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be the project leader. Therefore, Xue must be the project leader. Therefore, the three project members must be Smith, Verma, and Xue.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a member, Taylor must also be a member.
  If Wells is a member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a member.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a member, then Smith cannot be a member. Therefore, Wells cannot be a member because Wells being a member would require Smith to be a member. 
  If Wells is not a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a member. Therefore, Quinn must be a member because either Quinn or Ruiz must be a member and Ruiz cannot be a member.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
To solve this problem, we can use the contrapositive of the statement "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be." which is "If Taylor is not a project member, Smith cannot be a project member."

If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, we have two cases to consider: 
Case 1: Smith is not a project member. In this case, we can choose any three workers to be the project members. None of the constraints will be violated. Therefore, the answer could be any of the workers.
Case 2: Smith is a project member. In this case, neither Taylor nor Smith can be the project leader. Therefore, the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz. Also, we cannot choose Wells because neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is a project member. Therefore, the only remaining worker that must be a project member is Xue.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member, because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Smith is not a project member, then there is no constraint on who can be a project member. However, if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then one of Quinn, Ruiz, or Wells must be a project member.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members, and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. So, the project team will be selected from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Verma, and Xue.
  
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, the project team must be selected from the remaining three workers: Quinn, Smith, and Xue. However, we know that one of the project members must be the project leader, and Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member in this case.
  
  If Wells is not a project member, then the project team must be selected from the remaining four workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, and Xue. We know that one of the project members must be the project leader, and Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member and the project leader. Additionally, we know that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Since Taylor is not a project member, Smith cannot be a project member in this case. Therefore, the project team must consist of Quinn or Ruiz (as the project leader), Xue, and one of Smith or Verma.
  
  Answer: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have three members and one project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member, so only one of Quinn, Xue, and Smith can be a project member.
  If Wells is not a project member, then either Ruiz or Verma must be a project member, and the other two project members must be selected from Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
  
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then either Quinn, Smith, Wells, or Xue must be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three workers: one leader and two members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  Smith and Taylor are either both members or neither of them are members.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members.
  
If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member. Therefore, Wells must be a project member. If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members. Therefore, the only remaining workers who can be selected as project members are Quinn, Xue, and Wells. Since Quinn and Ruiz can only be project members if they are the project leader, and we do not know who the leader is, we cannot select Quinn or Ruiz as a guaranteed project member. Therefore, the answer is E: Xue.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Veqemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon
  C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy
  D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than, wellspring
  E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot 3.
  
  A: It is not necessarily true. We cannot determine the relative order of Uneasy and Xpert based on the given information.
  B: It is not necessarily true. We cannot determine the relative order of Wellspring and Zircon based on the given information.
  C: It is necessarily true. If Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots and Xpert performs after Wellspring and Zircon, then Xpert must perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
  D: It is not necessarily true. We cannot determine the relative order of Yardsign and Wellspring based on the given information.
  E: It is necessarily true. If Vegemite performs in slot 3, and it is given that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, then Zircon must perform in slot 4 or later. Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, Zircon cannot perform in slot 4. Therefore, Zircon must perform in slot 5 or 6. If Zircon performs in slot 5 or 6, then Uneasy must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon. Thus, Zircon performs in slot 4, and Uneasy performs in slot 5 or 6. Therefore, Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—need to be scheduled to perform in slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

Action: 
If Vegemite performs in slot three, then either Yardsign or Uneasy must perform in slot one, and the other band must perform in slot two. Zircon must perform in slot six, and Wellspring must perform in slot four. Therefore, the only choice that must be true is that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform in six different slots (slot 1 to slot 6).
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that Zircon performs in a later slot than slot three.
  - Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot six, because if Uneasy performs in slot six, then Zircon must perform in slot five, which would violate the constraint that Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite (who performs in slot three).
  - Since Uneasy cannot perform in slot six, and Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, we know that Uneasy must perform in either slot four or slot five.
  - Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, we know that Xpert must perform in either slot five or slot six.
  - Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, we know that Yardsign cannot perform in slot four, slot five, or slot six.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then the possible order of the bands and their slots is:
      Slot 1: Yardsign
      Slot 2: Wellspring
      Slot 3: Vegemite
      Slot 4: Zircon
      Slot 5: Uneasy
      Slot 6: Xpert
  - Therefore, Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, which is option B.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  According to the constraints, Zircon must perform in slot 4 or 5.
  If Zircon performs in slot 4, then Wellspring must perform in slot 3, and Xpert must perform in slot 6.
  If Zircon performs in slot 5, then Xpert must perform in slot 6, and Wellspring can perform in either slot 3 or slot 4.
  In either case, Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, but we don't know which one. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The concert promoter is filling six slots, numbered slot one through slot six, with six bands - Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.

  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Vegemite is in slot three.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  If Vegemite is in slot three, then we know that the first two slots must be filled by Yardsign and Wellspring (in some order). This means that Zircon must be in slot six, and by constraint (2), Xpert must be in slot five. Therefore, Wellspring must be in slot four, and Uneasy must be in slot five or six (by constraint 3). This means that Zircon is in an earlier slot than Wellspring (since Zircon is in slot six and Wellspring is in slot four), so option B must be true.

  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot six.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - There are six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band performs in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
  A: We don't know the position of Xpert, so we can't determine if Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true.
  B: We know that Zircon must perform in a later slot than Vegemite, and since Vegemite performs in slot three, Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six. Since Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, it must perform in slot one, two, or three. Therefore, Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon. This choice is true.
  C: We don't know the position of Xpert, so we can't determine if Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true.
  D: We know that Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, and since Vegemite performs in slot three, Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three. Therefore, Yardsign can't perform in an earlier slot than Wellspring, which must perform in slot one, two, or three. Therefore, this choice is not true.
  E: We know that Zircon must perform in a later slot than Vegemite, and since Vegemite performs in slot three, Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six. Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, it must perform in slot four, five, or six. Therefore, Zircon can't perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy. Therefore, this choice is not true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  Since Peters was recruited fourth, we can start counting from there.
  Peters -> (5) -> [6] -> (7) -> Villas -> (1) -> White -> (2) -> Rovero -> (3) -> Tao -> (4) -> Stanton
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must have been recruited last and Stanton must have been recruited before Tao.
  Therefore, Quinn could have been recruited first, which means (A) is a possible answer.
  Rovero could not have been recruited third, which means (B) is not a possible answer.
  Stanton could not have been recruited second, which means (C) is not a possible answer.
  Tao could not have been recruited sixth, which means (D) is not a possible answer.
  Villas could not have been recruited sixth, which means (E) is not a possible answer.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment would be: [Quinn, ?, White, Villas, Rovero, Tao, Stanton].
  
Analysis:
  - Since Peters was recruited fourth, then the order of recruitment would be: [Quinn, ?, ?, Peters, ?, ?, ?].
  - Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be: [Quinn, Rovero, ?, Peters, ?, ?, ?].
  - Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, then the order of recruitment would be: [Quinn, Rovero, ?, Peters, Villas, White, ?].
  - Since Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then the order of recruitment would be: [Quinn, Rovero, ?, Peters, Villas, White, Stanton/Tao].
  - Since White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment would be: [Quinn, Rovero, White, Peters, Villas, Tao, Stanton].
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  6. White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Using the given information, we can determine the following:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of Peters' recruitment and the recruitment of the first three accomplices must be: X X X Peters X X X.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be one of the first three accomplices recruited.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of their recruitment must be: X X X Villas White X X.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so the order of their recruitment must be: X Stanton X Tao X X X.
  
Based on these deductions, we can determine that:
  - Quinn was recruited first (Choice A) is possible since Quinn must be one of the first three recruited.
  - Rovero was recruited third (Choice B) is not possible since Villas was recruited immediately before White and Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was recruited second (Choice C) is not possible since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero and must be one of the first three recruited.
  - Tao was recruited sixth (Choice D) is not possible since Peters was recruited fourth and the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  - Villas was recruited sixth (Choice E) is possible since White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters cannot be first, second, or third.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas cannot be first or second.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be first, second, sixth, or seventh.
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the possible order of recruitment is: [Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Stanton, Peters] or [Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Peters].
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the accomplices' recruitment is Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of these three must be White, Rovero, Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the first four must be Quinn, Villas, Peters, Stanton.
  Therefore, Tao must be recruited next, and the only option that is possible is that Tao was recruited sixth. This means that Stanton was recruited second.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Stanton was recruited second.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  6. White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Using the given information, we can create a timeline of the order in which the accomplices were recruited:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. 
6. 
7. 

We know that Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White must be recruited in position 7, and Villas in position 6. We also know that Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters must be in position 4. 

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. 
6. Villas
7. White

We know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be in position 1 or 2, and Rovero must be in position 3 or 5. We also know that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Since there are only two positions left, Tao must be in position 2 or 5 and Stanton must be in position 3 or 5. 

1. Quinn
2. Tao
3. Stanton
4. Peters
5. Rovero
6. Villas
7. White

Now we can answer the question. If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must be in position 5 and Rovero must be in position 6. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Villas was recruited sixth. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Based on the given information, we can create a timeline of the recruitment order:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Peters
5. 
6. 
7. 

If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the timeline could look like this:
1. 
2. 
3. White
4. Rovero
5. Tao
6. Villas
7. Stanton/Quinn (depending on which was recruited first)

Option A: Quinn was recruited first. This is not possible because Peters was recruited fourth.
Option B: Rovero was recruited third. This is possible based on the given information.
Option C: Stanton was recruited second. This is not possible because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
Option D: Tao was recruited sixth. This is possible based on the given information.
Option E: Villas was recruited sixth. This is not possible because Villas was recruited immediately before White.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  From clue 1, Peters was recruited fourth. Hence, the order of recruitment is Peters-?-?-?-?-?-?
  From clue 3, Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Hence, the order of recruitment is Peters-Quinn-Rovero-?-?-?-?
  From clue 4, Villas was recruited immediately before White. Hence, the order of recruitment is Peters-Quinn-Rovero-Villas-White-?-?
  From clue 2, Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Hence, Tao cannot be recruited immediately after White. Therefore, the possible order of recruitment is Peters-Quinn-Rovero-Villas-White-Tao-Stanton or Peters-Quinn-Rovero-Villas-White-Stanton-Tao.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, Tao could have been recruited sixth.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Using the given information, we can make the following deductions:
  - Peters, Quinn, Villas, White, and Rovero were recruited before Tao.
  - Tao was either recruited fifth or sixth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn was recruited either first or second.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas was recruited either third or fourth.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton was recruited either first, second, fifth, or sixth.
  
If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then we can eliminate options A, C, and E because they do not follow this order. 

Option D, "Tao was recruited sixth", is also not possible because if Tao was recruited sixth, then the order of the first five recruits would have to be Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, and Peters. But this order is not possible because Peters was recruited fourth.

Therefore, the only possible option is B: "Rovero was recruited third."
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  We know that Villas was recruited immediately before White, and White was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Villas must have been recruited earlier than Rovero. Also, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited earlier than Villas. Therefore, the order of recruitment must be: Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, and Tao. 
  A: Quinn was recruited first - Incorrect, based on the order established above.
  B: Rovero was recruited third - Correct, based on the order established above.
  C: Stanton was recruited second - Incorrect, based on the order established above.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth - Incorrect, based on the order established above.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth - Incorrect, based on the order established above.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, is a rule that affects the publication schedule of the cookbooks.
  A: The publication of L and M in different seasons does not affect the publication schedule of the other cookbooks.
  B: The publication of N and P in the same season does not affect the publication schedule of the other cookbooks.
  C: The publication of M and P in different seasons affects the publication schedule of the other cookbooks.
  D: The publication of N and M in the same season does not affect the publication schedule of the other cookbooks.
  E: The publication of O and N in the same season affects the publication schedule of the other cookbooks.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 cookbooks: K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  - Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  - Option A is not relevant to the condition being replaced.
  - Option B is about N and P, which is not relevant to the condition being replaced.
  - Option C is about M and P, which is not relevant to the condition being replaced.
  - Option D states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This is the same as the original condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  - Option E is about O and N, which is not relevant to the condition being replaced.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are six cookbooks K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season. 
  Choice A states that if L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This does not have the same effect as the original condition because it only relates to L and M, not M and N.
  Choice B states that if N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This does not have the same effect as the original condition because it only relates to N and P, not M and N.
  Choice C states that if M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This does not have the same effect as the original condition because it only relates to M and P, not M and N.
  Choice D states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This has the same effect as the original condition because it means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  Choice E states that if O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This does not have the same effect as the original condition because it only relates to O and N, not M and N.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The cookbook schedule involves six books, K, L, M, N, O, and P, which will be published in one of two seasons, fall or spring.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  - K and N must be published in the same season.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
  - Choice D provides a substitution that has the same effect as the given condition. If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in different seasons, just as in the original condition.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—that will be published in either fall or spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season. Answer choice D states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This has the same effect as the original condition, as it means that M and N cannot be published in the same season. Answer choices A, B, C, and E do not have the same effect as the original condition and would not result in the same schedule for the publication of the cookbooks.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—that will be published in two seasons—fall or spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
  If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This condition is equivalent to the given condition because it ensures that M and N are not published in the same season.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are six cookbooks: K, L, M, N, O, and P
  Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  The condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, can be rephrased as "M and N cannot be published in the same season." Therefore, if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring to avoid violating this condition. Choice D correctly substitutes this condition and has the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P— that will be published in two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  This condition means that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This has the same effect on the schedule as the original condition, which states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. The other answer choices do not have the same effect on the schedule.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
Option A has no effect on the schedule of N and M.
Option B has no effect on the schedule of M and P.
Option C has no effect on the schedule of N and M.
Option D is the correct answer because if N is published in the spring, then K cannot be published in the fall, which means O cannot be published in the fall either. Therefore, M must be published in the spring. This is the same effect as the original condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Option E has no effect on the schedule of N and M.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The given conditions are:
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. - This condition does not have the same effect as the given condition.
B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. - This condition does not have the same effect as the given condition.
C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. - This condition does not have the same effect as the given condition.
D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. - This condition has the same effect as the given condition.
E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. - This condition does not have the same effect as the given condition.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings - one oil and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
To determine the answer, we can use the following deductions:
  1. Since Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and no wall can have only watercolors, Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  2. Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, Franz's oil cannot be on wall 1.
  3. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Greene's watercolor must be on wall 3.
  4. Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it and Franz's oil is on wall 3, Hidalgo's paintings must be on walls 1 and 4.
  5. Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  
Therefore, the answer is Hidalgo's oil, which is displayed on wall 1. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on walls 1 and 4. Since Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1. Since no wall can have only watercolors, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 2. Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1. Thus, the correct answer is C: Greene's watercolor.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The exhibition room has four walls, and each wall has an upper and a lower position for paintings.
  Each of the four art students will display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Hidalgo cannot have any paintings on walls 2 or 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  - Each student will display exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we can deduce the following:
  - Isaacs's oil is not on wall 2 because he already has his watercolor there.
  - Isaacs's oil is not on wall 3 because Franz's oil is displayed there.
  - Isaacs's oil is not on wall 1 because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Therefore, Isaacs's oil must be on wall 4.
  - Since Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 2, his oil must be in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Therefore, the upper position of wall 4 must have a painting by a student other than Isaacs.
  - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, and Franz's oil is on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be on wall 1 or wall 2.
  - However, Greene cannot have both his paintings on the same wall, so his oil must be on a different wall from his watercolor.
  - Therefore, Greene's oil must be on wall 2.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then either Hidalgo's oil or Hidalgo's watercolor must be on wall 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on walls 1 and 4.
  - Since Hidalgo has one oil and one watercolor, we cannot determine which one of Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are four walls in the exhibition room, each displaying two paintings - one oil and one watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then the paintings displayed on wall 1 and wall 4 can be determined by elimination.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each student has exactly one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  2. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
We know that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3. This means that Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1, because it is the only painting left that has not been placed yet. According to condition 6, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, we can deduce that Franz's oil is displayed on wall 1 in the lower position. This means that Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 4, and since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  - Each student has exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  - Two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room (walls 1, 2, 3, and 4), with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1 because:
  
  - No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, so wall 2 must have one oil painting (Isaacs's oil) and one watercolor painting (Isaacs's watercolor).
  - Wall 3 has Franz's oil, so it cannot have Franz's watercolor. It must have one painting by another student, which must be Hidalgo's painting.
  - Wall 4 has Isaacs's oil in the lower position, so it cannot have Hidalgo's oil in the lower position. It must have Hidalgo's watercolor in the lower position.
  - Wall 1 must have two paintings, one by Greene and one by Hidalgo. It cannot have Isaacs's paintings (because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it), so it must have Hidalgo's oil and Greene's watercolor.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are four walls (1, 2, 3, and 4) and each will have two paintings (one oil and one watercolor) displayed on it.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1. This is because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3. Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1 to satisfy the condition. 
Action: Answer("C")

  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 3, and Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

To satisfy the given conditions:
- George must give a report on Tuesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give reports in the morning.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Analysis:
If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then the remaining three students who will give reports are Helen, Irving, and Kyle. Since exactly two reports will be given each day, we know that George and Robert will give their reports in the morning, and Nina will give her report in the afternoon. Therefore, none of them will give a report on Monday. This means that Nina's report will be given on either Tuesday or Wednesday. If Nina's report is given on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. If Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday. In either case, Helen will give a report on Wednesday. 

Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday. This could be true. 
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday. This is not possible because none of the three students will give a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday. This is not possible because George will give a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday. This is not possible because none of the three students will give a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday. This is not possible because Robert will give a report in the morning, and there will be no morning report on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - George gives a report only on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - There are only three reports each day for three consecutive days.
  
  A: We know that George cannot give a report on Monday, so Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give a report on Tuesday, but there are no more available reports for Wednesday.
  C: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give a report on Wednesday, but there are no more available reports for Monday.
  D: If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Robert must give a report on Tuesday, and George must give a report on Wednesday. However, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this option is not possible.
  E: If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Nina must give a report on Monday, and George must give a report on Tuesday. However, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly six students will give oral reports during three consecutive days, with two reports given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  - Since George, Nina, and Robert give reports, we know that they will give them on different days from one another.
  - Since Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, he cannot give his report on Monday or Wednesday.
  - Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they must give their reports in the morning.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George is already giving a report on Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The statement "Helen gives a report on Wednesday" could be true.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  * George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  * Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  * If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  * Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  * Six students will give reports, and they will do so on three consecutive days.
  
Analysis:
  * If George gives a report on Tuesday, then only one report can be given with him. Therefore, neither Nina nor Robert can give a report on Tuesday.
  * If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday, as there would be no day left for Helen and Irving to give their reports.
  * If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then neither Olivia nor Robert can give a report on Monday. Therefore, George and Robert must give their reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, and Nina must give her report on Wednesday. This means that Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday, and Olivia must give her report on Monday.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly 6 students will give individual oral reports during 3 consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
  - Exactly 2 reports will be given each day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon).
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, that means that:
  - George must give his report on Tuesday.
  - Nina and Robert must give their reports on Monday and Wednesday (in any order).
  - Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
  
  A: There are no reports on Thursday, so Helen giving a report on Wednesday is not possible.
  B: Nina cannot give a report on Monday because both of her possible report days (Tuesday and Wednesday) are after Monday.
  C: Nina must give her report on Tuesday, so this is a possible scenario.
  D: Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
  E: Robert must give his report on Wednesday, so this is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  - Exactly 6 students will give individual oral reports during 3 consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly 2 reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("C")

If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (which is either Tuesday or Wednesday), Helen and Irving must both give reports. Therefore, George cannot give a report on Tuesday, since he is the only one who can give a report on that day. So, George must give a report on Monday or Wednesday. Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they must give reports in the morning. If Robert gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George must give a report on that day. Therefore, Robert must give a report on Wednesday. This means that George and Nina must give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. Finally, since Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, Helen must give a report in the morning and Irving must give a report in the afternoon. Thus, Nina gives a report on Tuesday. 

Therefore, the only statement that could be true is that Nina gives a report on Tuesday. So, the answer is C.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - George gives a report only on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Six students will give reports.
  
Analysis:
  - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then the only remaining day that Nina and Robert can give their reports is Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  - If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then the only remaining day that Nina can give her report is Monday.
  - Therefore, A and B are not possible because Helen must give a report on Wednesday and Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  - C is possible because Nina can give a report on Wednesday and Helen and Irving can give reports on Tuesday.
  - D is not possible because Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
  - E is not possible because Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

If George, Nina, and Robert give reports, then the other three students who give reports must be chosen from among Helen, Irving, and Kyle.

If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is impossible because George must give a report on Tuesday.

If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday, which means that Kyle must give a report on Monday, and Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.

If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports, which means that Kyle must give a report on Monday, and Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.

Therefore, it is possible that Nina gives a report on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  - Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot be paired with Nina or Robert.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina can only give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. This leaves only Lenore and Kyle to give reports on Wednesday, which violates the condition that exactly two reports will be given each day.
  - Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  - Since George and Robert cannot give reports on Wednesday, George must give a report on Tuesday and Robert must give a report on Monday.
  - This leaves Lenore and Kyle to give reports on Tuesday, and Helen and Irving to give reports on Monday.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members, and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("D")  
If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz. Since neither of them is a project member, the third member must be selected from the remaining workers: Smith, Taylor, Verma, or Xue. The selection of the third member is subject to the constraint that if Smith is selected, Taylor must also be. Therefore, the only possible selection is Wells as the project leader, and Smith and Taylor as the other two members.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have three members, one of which will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is in the project, Taylor must also be in the project.
  If Wells is in the project, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be in the project.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find the option that will completely determine the selection for the project. In other words, selecting that option will make it possible to know exactly which three workers will be selected and who will be the project leader. Let's analyze each option:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. This option does not completely determine the selection because we do not know if Quinn or Ruiz will be the project leader.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected. This option does not completely determine the selection because we do not know if Quinn or Ruiz will be the project leader.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected. This option does not completely determine the selection because we do not know if Quinn or Ruiz will be the project leader.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected. This option does not completely determine the selection because we do not know if Quinn or Ruiz will be the project leader.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected. This option completely determines the selection because if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be in the project. Therefore, Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, and the third member of the project must be Smith or Taylor (depending on whether Smith is in the project or not).
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project requires three workers, one of whom will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Action: Answer("E") 

If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the only possible leader is Quinn. If Quinn is the leader, then Ruiz can be selected as a project member. If Ruiz is selected, then Verma cannot be selected. Therefore, if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, the selection for the project is completely determined.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The selection is subject to the following constraints:
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find the selection that completely determines the project members and leader. This means that all other selections can be eliminated. Let's analyze each option:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected - This does not completely determine the selection as we don't know who will be the leader and the third member.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected - This does not completely determine the selection as we don't know who will be the leader and the third member.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected - This does not completely determine the selection as we don't know who will be the leader and the third member.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected - This completely determines the selection as per the given constraints. If Wells is not selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. This means that only Quinn can be the leader and the remaining two members will be Smith and Taylor.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected - This does not completely determine the selection as we don't know who will be the leader and the third member.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. 
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. Therefore, this selection is not completely determined.
B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected. Therefore, this selection is not completely determined.
C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, there are still multiple possibilities for the selection of project members and leader. Therefore, this selection is not completely determined.
D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Verma must be selected and be the project leader. Therefore, this selection is completely determined.
E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected and be the project leader. Therefore, this selection is completely determined.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members, and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("D") 
If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Quinn can only be selected if she is the project leader. Smith and Taylor must be selected together. Verma and Ruiz cannot be selected together if Wells is selected. Therefore, the only remaining member is Xue, who can be selected for the project. This selection satisfies all of the constraints and completely determines the selection for the project.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have 3 members and 1 leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that same sales zone. Therefore, there are at least 3 sales representatives working in that sales zone. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3, and Stuckey works in Zone 3. Therefore, D is the correct answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must work in the same sales zone as well since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, there are at least three sales representatives working in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Mahr and Stuckey must work in Zone 3. 
  
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. This is not possible because Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1. This is not possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and neither of them is Mahr.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. This is possible because Parra could be in the same sales zone as Quinn, and both could be in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. This is not possible because we know that Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, and we have already determined that they must be in Zone 3.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1. This is not possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and we have already determined that Parra works in Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they can't both work in Zone 2 because Stuckey and Udall are already paired.
  
Eliminating impossible choices: 
  - (A) Kim can't work in Zone 2 because Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2.
  - (B) Mahr can't work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - (C) Parra can't work in Zone 3 because Parra is paired with Quinn who can't work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - (D) Stuckey could work in Zone 2 if Mahr works in Zone 3 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  - (E) Tiao can't work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they are either both in Zone 1, both in Zone 2, or both in Zone 3. However, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey cannot both be in Zone 1 or both be in Zone 2. This means that they must both be in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it is possible that Stuckey works in Zone 2. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs exactly 7 sales representatives to work in its 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they must work either in Zone 2 or Zone 3. 
  If they work in Zone 2, then Udall also works in Zone 2, and Tiao works in Zone 1, which would mean that Parra works in Zone 3 with Quinn and Kim. This would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey must work in Zone 3.
  
A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are fewer sales representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3.
B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
D: Stuckey must work in Zone 3, which is true.
E: Tiao must work in Zone 1, which is also true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives.
  The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Parra and Quinn must also work in that sales zone. This means that Zone 1 and Zone 2 each have at most one sales representative.
  
  A: There is no information that suggests Kim could work in Zone 2.
  B: There is no information that suggests Mahr could work in Zone 1.
  C: There is no information that suggests Parra could work in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey working in Zone 2 would contradict the information that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  E: There is no information that suggests Tiao could work in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("D")  
If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then there are only two possible scenarios: they both work in Zone 2 or they both work in Zone 3. However, we know from the given conditions that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, if Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, it must be Zone 3, and the only option that could be true is that Stuckey works in Zone 2. Thus, the answer is (D) Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in that zone because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  - If Udall works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 (because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2). But this would mean that both Parra and Tiao work in Zone 1, which is not allowed. So Udall cannot work in Zone 1.
  - Therefore, Udall works in Zone 3.
  - Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  - So, the sales representatives in Zone 3 are Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.
  - Therefore, Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 1.
  - Since Parra is in Zone 3, Tiao must be in Zone 1.
  - Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 1.
  - So, the only option that could be true is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, there are at least three sales representatives in this sales zone. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall work in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3 as well. By the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, it follows that Tiao works in Zone 1. Therefore, Kim works in Zone 2.
  
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone:
  - Udall cannot work in that zone because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  - Quinn and Parra must work in the same zone as well.
  - Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because Tiao and Parra cannot work in the same zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - Mahr cannot work in Zone 1 because Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Quinn and Parra must work in the same zone as well.
  - Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because Quinn and Parra must work in the same zone.
  - Stuckey can work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  - Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
- U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
- W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 3, 4, or 5.
- If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7, which is not possible because X is already mentioned in chapter 1.
- Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
- R is the only clue that can be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, because T and U must be mentioned before W and X.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. This is possible. Answer("A")

B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. This is not possible, because R must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, and W must be mentioned after T.

C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. This is not possible, because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. This is possible. Answer("D")

E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. This is not possible, because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each chapter must contain exactly one clue.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. 
  Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5.
  Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 1, 2, 6, or 7.
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 7.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and T must be mentioned before W, T must be mentioned in either chapter 3 or 4.
  - Therefore, W must be mentioned in either chapter 5 or 6.
  - Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  - Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters and X is mentioned in chapter 1, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, W could be mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The mystery novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  - Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - From the constraint "W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters", it follows that W is mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  - From the constraint "T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W", it follows that T is mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and W is mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  - From the constraint "S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters", it follows that S is mentioned in chapter 3 or later, and Z is mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
  - From the above analysis, it is possible that R is mentioned in chapter 3 or 7, and it is possible that W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, and it must be mentioned in either chapter 4 or 5. Since T must be mentioned before W, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4. This leaves only one possible order for the clues:

Chapter 1: X
Chapter 2: U
Chapter 3: T
Chapter 4: S
Chapter 5: W
Chapter 6: R
Chapter 7: Z

Therefore, the only option that could be true if X is mentioned in chapter 1 is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
  - U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 (because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters), so W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 (because T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W), so T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  - S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 (because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters), so S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  - Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 (because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters), so Z must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  
Let's check each choice:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. This is possible. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6. Therefore, R can be mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. This is not possible. R must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, or 4, because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then there would be no place to mention S or Z without violating this constraint.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. This is not possible. If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, but there would be no place to mention Z without violating the constraint that T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. This is possible. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, so T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6. Therefore, W can be mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. This is not possible. If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later, but there would be no place to mention S without violating the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - The clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - Also, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 (because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters), so W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  - Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and T must be mentioned before W, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
  - Since there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then the possible orderings for T, W, and X are: T _ _ W X or _ T _ W X.
  - Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 4 and 6 (in some order).
  - Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 7 because it is the only remaining chapter.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 (because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters), nor in chapter 3 (because T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W).
  - Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
  - If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and S must be mentioned in chapter 4 (because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters). Then, Z must be mentioned in chapter 6 and R must be mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, the answer is B.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.

  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. 
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4. But X cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, so this is not possible.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5. But X cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, so this is not possible.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6. This is possible.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7, but this is not possible because there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 6, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7, but this is not possible because there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  
Action: Answer("D")

  - W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in either chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. So, T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or chapter 3, and W must be mentioned in either chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  - R must be mentioned in either chapter 3, chapter 4, or chapter 5.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. (This violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.)
B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. (This violates the constraint that each of seven clues must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.)
C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. (This violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.)
D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. (This violates the constraint that W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.)

Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then which one of the following could be true?

  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: 
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the only possible section that could have both photographs by Gagnon is the Metro section. This means that the other photographer in the Metro section must be Fuentes or Hue. However, since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, this means that the Lifestyle section cannot have both photographs by Hue. Therefore, the only possible option is that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.

This means that the Sports section must have at least one photograph by Fuentes or Hue.
  
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. (Not possible because the Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by Fuentes or Hue.)
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. (Possible, as long as neither photograph is by Gagnon.)

  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("E") 

If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon can have at most two photographs in that section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, Gagnon must have two photographs in either the Lifestyle or Metro section. However, in both of these cases, there must be at least one photograph by either Fuentes or Hue in that section. Therefore, the only possible option is that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is consistent with the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("E")
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have two photographs, one by Fuentes and one by Hue. According to the constraint, the Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since Gagnon has already been assigned to two photographs in one of the sections, Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Metro section. Therefore, both photographs in the Metro section must be by Fuentes and Hue. Finally, since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and each of these sections already has one photograph by Hue and Fuentes, respectively, the remaining two photographs in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue. Therefore, both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, so the answer is E.
Response 5:
Knowledge:

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, both photographs in the Lifestyle and Metro sections must have been taken by Fuentes and Hue. This means that both photographs in the Sports section must have been taken by Hue, since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Answer: E
Response 6:

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Answer: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be either one or two. According to the condition, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. If one Fuentes photograph appears in the Sports section, then one Hue photograph must appear in the Lifestyle section. If two Fuentes photographs appear in the Sports section, then two Hue photographs must appear in the Lifestyle section. Since there are only two photographs in each section, the only possibility is that both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. Therefore, the answer is A. Answer("A")

If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then there can be no photographs by Gagnon in the Sports section, according to the given conditions. Therefore, the Sports section must have two photographs by the other two photographers, Fuentes and Hue. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Since there are no photographs by Gagnon in the Sports section, there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes. This means that the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, so either Fuentes or Hue must also have a photograph in the Metro section. However, it is possible for both photographs in the Sports section to be by Hue, so (E) is a possible scenario.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Two photographs from each photographer must be selected.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation:
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then neither of the two photographs in the Sports section can be by Gagnon. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, both photographs in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and Hue. Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, both photographs in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue. Therefore, both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, which means that option A is true.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are 3 sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are 6 photographs in total, exactly 2 per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("A") 

If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot appear in the Sports section. Therefore, all three photographers must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle and Metro sections. This means that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then there would be no Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which violates the constraint. Therefore, A is not possible. B is possible because it satisfies all the constraints. C is not possible because there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. D is possible because it satisfies all the constraints. E is not possible because there must be at least one photograph in the Sports section by either Fuentes or Hue.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - From the first condition, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - From the third condition, we know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - From the fourth condition, we know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  - We can use the second condition to make inferences about the order of the items. If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp. If the lamp is auctioned before the harmonica, then the mirror could be auctioned before or after the lamp.
  - We can use the information we have to create a chart of possible auction orders:
  
| Day | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1   |        |        |        | sundial|        |        |
| 2   |        |        | mirror |        |        |        |
| 3   |        |        |        |        | lamp   |        |
| 4   |        |        |        |        |        | vase   |
| 5   |        | table  |        |        |        |        |
| 6   | harmonica |        |        |        |        |        |

Action: Answer("D") - The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Six antiques are auctioned, one per day for six consecutive days.
  - The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

Solution:
  - From the given conditions, we know that:
    - Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
    - If harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
    - Sundial is auctioned before the mirror and vase.
    - Table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  - Let's try to place the antiques on each day based on the given conditions:
    - June 1st: Not Sundial
    - June 2nd: Harmonica/Lamp/Mirror
    - June 3rd: Lamp/Harmonica/Mirror
    - June 4th: Sundial
    - June 5th: Table
    - June 6th: Vase
  - From the above arrangement, we can see that the lamp can be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, and the mirror can be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  - Therefore, the following could be true:
    - A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
    - E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
  - However, we cannot determine the exact date of the lamp or the mirror auction based on the given conditions.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  3. The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  4. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
- If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This would mean that the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which contradicts condition 1. Therefore, A is not true.

B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
- If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the mirror must also be auctioned on June 2nd or earlier. This would mean that the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This arrangement satisfies all the conditions, so B could be true.

C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
- If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the harmonica, lamp, and mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This would violate condition 3, which states that the sundial must be auctioned before the vase. Therefore, C is not true.

D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
- If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or earlier. This would mean that the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later. This arrangement satisfies all the conditions, so D could be true.

E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
- If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th. This would mean that the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd or later. This arrangement violates condition 3, which states that the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, E is not true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

Using the rules, we can create a timeline of the auction dates and determine which options are possible.

June 1st: [Not Sundial]
June 2nd: [Harmonica or Lamp], [Not Mirror], [Not Sundial], [Not Table], [Not Vase]
June 3rd: [Not Harmonica], [Lamp], [Not Mirror], [Sundial], [Not Table], [Not Vase]
June 4th: [Not Harmonica], [Not Lamp], [Not Mirror], [Not Sundial], [Table], [Not Vase]
June 5th: [Not Harmonica], [Not Lamp], [Mirror], [Not Sundial], [Not Table], [Vase]
June 6th: [Not Harmonica], [Not Lamp], [Not Mirror], [Not Sundial], [Not Table], [Not Vase]

Possible options are:

Action: Answer("B") or Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. However, the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd. This means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. Therefore, the statement is false.
B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st and the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. However, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, the statement is true.
C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd or later, and the table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica. However, this is not possible because the table cannot be auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, the statement is false.
D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. However, this is not possible because the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the statement is false.
E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd or earlier. However, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, the statement is false.

Action: Answer("B")

  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and it is auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on either June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th. 
  Also, the table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on either June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st. But this is not possible because the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd and the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st if the harmonica and the mirror are auctioned on that day. Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.

  - The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - June 1st: The sundial cannot be auctioned.
  - June 2nd: The harmonica and the lamp are possible options. If the lamp is auctioned before the harmonica, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the harmonica. The vase cannot be auctioned yet because the sundial must be auctioned before it.
  - June 3rd: The harmonica and the lamp are possible options. If the lamp is auctioned before the harmonica, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the harmonica. The vase cannot be auctioned yet because the sundial must be auctioned before it.
  - June 4th: The sundial must be auctioned on this day. The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the harmonica or the vase must be auctioned on June 4th.
  - June 5th: The mirror or the vase can be auctioned on this day. If the vase is not auctioned yet, then it must be auctioned on June 5th because it cannot be auctioned on June 6th. If the mirror is not auctioned yet, then it can be auctioned on June 5th.
  - June 6th: The remaining item is auctioned on this day.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: The mirror can be auctioned on June 2nd if the lamp is also auctioned on June 2nd, and the harmonica is auctioned on a later date.

C: It is not possible for the vase to be auctioned on June 2nd because the sundial must be auctioned before the vase.
D: It is not possible for the lamp to be auctioned on June 3rd because if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp, and the mirror cannot be auctioned on June 3rd.
E: It is possible for the mirror to be auctioned on June 5th because the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the sundial can be auctioned on June 1st. The harmonica and the table cannot be auctioned on June 5th because the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both. The vase cannot be auctioned on June 5th because the sundial must be auctioned before the vase.

  - If the sundial is auctioned on June 6th, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th, which means it is possible for the harmonica or the vase to be auctioned after the table. 
  - If the sundial is auctioned on June 5th, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, which means it is possible for the harmonica or the vase to be auctioned after the table. 
  - If the sundial is auctioned on June 4th, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, which means it is possible for the harmonica or the vase to be auctioned after the table. 
  - If the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which means it is possible for the harmonica or the vase to be auctioned after the table.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson

  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  The question asks which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony. We need to check each option to see if it is a valid assignment according to the given constraints.

Option A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony, so they can't be assigned to Silva University and Thorne University respectively.
  Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, but Lai must be assigned to Thorne University if Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University. Therefore, Lai cannot be assigned to Silva University.
  Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University, so both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson cannot be assigned to Silva University.
  This option is not valid.

Option B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony. They can be assigned to Silva University.
  Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, but Lai must be assigned to Thorne University if Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University. Therefore, Lai cannot be assigned to Silva University.
  This option is valid.

Option C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, but Lai must be assigned to Thorne University if Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University. Therefore, Lai cannot be assigned to Silva University.
  Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University, so both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson cannot be assigned to Silva University.
  This option is not valid.

Option D: Heideck, Lai
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony, so they can't be assigned to Silva University and Thorne University respectively.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. Therefore, Lai cannot be assigned to Silva University.
  This option is not valid.

Option E: Knutson, Mays
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony, so they can't be assigned to Silva University and Thorne University respectively.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. Therefore, Mays cannot be assigned to Silva University.

In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be: 1-Tao, 2-?, 3-?, 4-Peters, 5-?, 6-?, 7-White. 
The following options are possible based on the given information:
  A: Quinn was recruited third. (possible, since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero)
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth. (not possible, since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero)
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth. (not possible, since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao)
  D: Villas was recruited sixth. (not possible, since Villas was recruited immediately before White)
  E: White was recruited third. (not possible, since Peters was recruited fourth)

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the accomplices would be: 
  1. X
  2. Tao
  3. Y
  4. Peters
  5. Z
  6. W
  7. Villas
Where X, Y, Z, and W are four of the remaining five accomplices.

A: Quinn cannot be recruited third because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
B: Rovero cannot be recruited fifth because Peters was recruited fourth.
C: Stanton cannot be recruited sixth because Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
D: Villas could be recruited sixth because Villas was recruited immediately before White.
E: White cannot be recruited third because Villas was recruited immediately before White.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  Since Tao was recruited second, Peters was recruited first. Thus, the order of the accomplices' recruitment is Peters, Tao, __, __, __, __, __.
  We know that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited either third, fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited either third or fourth, and Rovero must have been recruited either fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited either fifth or sixth, and White must have been recruited either sixth or seventh.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited first, then Quinn must have been recruited third. This means that Rovero could have been recruited fifth. Since Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao, Stanton must have been recruited either fourth or sixth. Thus, Villas could have been recruited sixth, and White could have been recruited seventh. Therefore, (B) Rovero was recruited fifth could be true.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  A: If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn cannot be recruited third because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth.
  B: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, the order of recruitment would be Tao, Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, and Stanton, which means that Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, the order of recruitment would be Tao, Peters, Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, and Stanton, which means that Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: If Tao was recruited second, and Villas was recruited immediately before White, then Peters must have been recruited fourth, and the order of recruitment would be Tao, Peters, Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, and Stanton, which means that Villas could not have been recruited sixth.
  E: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, the order of recruitment would be Tao, Peters, Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, and Stanton, which means that White could not have been recruited third.

     This is not possible since Peters was recruited fourth.
     
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited first, and there are only five remaining positions to fill. 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited either second or third. 
  If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then Villas must have been recruited either fifth or sixth. 
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so he must have been recruited either third, fourth, or fifth. 
  
Action: Answer("D") 
  If Tao was recruited second, and Peters was recruited fourth, then Villas must have been recruited either fifth or sixth. If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then it is possible that Villas was recruited sixth, making choice D a possible scenario.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Seven people were recruited one at a time.
  2. Peters was recruited fourth.
  3. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  4. Quinn was recruited before Rovero.

If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be: 
1. X
2. Tao
3. Y
4. Peters
5. Z
6. Villas
7. White

Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton must be recruited either first, third, or seventh.

A: Quinn was recruited third. This is possible, as Quinn could be one of the people represented by X or Y.
B: Rovero was recruited fifth. This is possible, as Rovero could be one of the people represented by Z.
C: Stanton was recruited sixth. This is not possible, as Stanton must be recruited either first, third, or seventh.
D: Villas was recruited sixth. This is not possible, as Villas was recruited seventh.
E: White was recruited third. This is not possible, as Peters was recruited fourth.

  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
  A: If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited first, then Quinn could not have been recruited third because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited before Rovero. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited first, then Rovero could not have been recruited fifth because Peters was recruited fourth, and Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited first, then Stanton could not have been recruited sixth because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited first, then Villas could have been recruited sixth because Villas was recruited immediately before White, and Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited first, then White could not have been recruited third because Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, E is not true.
Action: Answer("D")

  2. Peters was recruited fourth.
  3. Stanton wasn't immediately before or after Tao.
  4. Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  5. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited third. 
  
  A: If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero would have to be recruited second, which would violate rule 4. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Quinn would have to be recruited first, which would violate rule 4. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Tao would have to be recruited fifth, which would violate rule 3. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then White would have to be recruited seventh, which would violate rule 5. Therefore, D is not true.
  E: If White was recruited third, then Villas would have to be recruited second, which would violate rule 5. Therefore, E is not true.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:

  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the recruits would be: [unknown], Tao, [unknown], [unknown], [unknown], [unknown], [unknown]. 

Analysis of each choice:
  A: If Quinn was recruited third, then the order of the recruits would be: [unknown], Tao, Quinn, [unknown], [unknown], [unknown], [unknown]. This could be true, so it is a possible answer.
  B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of the recruits would be: [unknown], Tao, [unknown], [unknown], Rovero, [unknown], [unknown]. This is not possible because we know Peters was recruited fourth and the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order of the recruits would be: [unknown], Tao, [unknown], [unknown], [unknown], Stanton, [unknown]. This is not possible because we know Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of the recruits would be: [unknown], Tao, [unknown], [unknown], [unknown], Villas, White. This is not possible because we know Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  E: If White was recruited third, then the order of the recruits would be: [unknown], Tao, [unknown], White, [unknown], [unknown], [unknown]. This is not possible because we know Peters was recruited fourth and the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Truvest has a website target and a voicemail target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days. 

Analysis:
  - If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's website target must be 1 day. However, this would violate the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, option A is not true.
  - If Image's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day. However, this would violate the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, option B is not true.
  - If Image's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be 1 day as well. This satisfies the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, option C could be true.
  - If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day. However, this would violate the condition that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target. Therefore, option D is not true.
  - If Solide's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's website target must also be 1 day. This satisfies the condition that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target. Therefore, option E could be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Truvest has two targets: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, if Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target must be at least 2 days.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- Based on the previous condition, we can infer that Image's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days.

Analysis:
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Truvest's voicemail target is at least 2 days.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- Based on the previous condition, we can infer that Image's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
- We cannot determine the exact value of Image's website target or Truvest's voicemail target.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest has two targets, one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days.
  If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must also be 1 day, which violates the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days.
  
Analysis:
  If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must also be 2 days, which means that Solide's voicemail target is 3 days. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, which means that Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 2 days. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which means that Solide's website target cannot be 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day.

Action: Answer("E")

  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  Analysis:
  - If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's voicemail target must be 1 day or 2 days. This means that Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, which contradicts the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Truvest's website target cannot be 1 day.
  - If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days or 3 days. This means that Image's voicemail target must be 2 days or 3 days. However, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, which means that Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days or 3 days. This means that Image's voicemail target must be 2 days, and Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.

    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is 1 day and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
  
A: Image's voicemail target being 2 days is not necessarily true, because Image's voicemail target could be either 1 day or 3 days, depending on the targets of the other clients.
B: Image's website target being 2 days is not necessarily true, because Image's website target could be either 1 day or 3 days, depending on the targets of the other clients.
C: Image's website target being 1 day is not necessarily true, because Image's website target could be either 2 days or 3 days, depending on the targets of the other clients.
D: Solide's website target being 2 days is not necessarily true, because Solide's website target could be either 1 day or 3 days, depending on the targets of the other clients.
E: Solide's website target being 1 day is the only option that must be true, because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and we know that Truvest's website target is 1 day. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest's website target being shorter than its voicemail target means that Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Analysis: 
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target cannot be longer than 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Image's website target cannot be longer than 2 days. This means that Image's website target must be 1 day or 2 days. 

Action: Answer("B")  
The answer is B: Image's website target is 2 days.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The articles are divided into two groups: finance (G, H, J) and nutrition (Q, R, S) and there is one article about wildlife (Y).
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles will be one of the following:
1. Q _ S Y _ _ _   (since S must be earlier than Y, Q must be first or third)
2. S _ Q Y _ _ _   (since S must be earlier than Y, Q must be third)
3. G J _ Y _ _ _   (since J must be earlier than G)
4. H J _ Y _ _ _   (since J must be earlier than G, but G is not the first finance article)
5. J G _ Y _ _ _   (since J must be earlier than G)
6. H G _ Y _ _ _   (since J must be earlier than G, but G is not the first finance article)

A: J cannot be second in any of the possible orders.
B: J is third in order 1 and order 5.
C: Q is first in order 1 and order 3.
D: Q is third in order 2 and order 4.
E: R is seventh in all possible orders.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles is G, H, J, Q, R, S, Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be Q, R, and S (since S must be earlier than Y). 
  Then, J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. This means that G must be fifth and H must be sixth. 
  Therefore, the order of the articles is Q, R, S, Y, G, H.

Action: Answer("B") 
  J must be third, since it must be earlier than G.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  - Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  - One article covers wildlife: Y.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be Q, R, and S in some order. Since S must be earlier than Y, S must be first, and Q must be third. Therefore, R must be second. Since J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, J cannot be second. Therefore, J must be fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh. This means that Q, R, and S must be the first three articles, and G and H must be the last two articles. 
  A: J cannot be second.
  B: J must be fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  C: Q cannot be first.
  D: Q must be third.
  E: R cannot be seventh.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - 3 articles cover finance (G, H, J), 3 articles cover nutrition (Q, R, S), and 1 article covers wildlife (Y).
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, the order of the first three articles must be QRS. 

  A: If J is second, then the order of the first three articles would be GJQ or HJQ, which would violate the rule that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  B: If J is third, then the order of the first three articles would be GHJ, which satisfies all the conditions.
  C: If Q is first, then the order of the first three articles would be QRS, which satisfies all the conditions, but it would violate the fact that Y is fourth.
  D: If Q is third, then the order of the first three articles would be SRQ, which satisfies all the conditions.
  E: If R is seventh, then the order of the first six articles would be GHJQYS, which satisfies all the conditions.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance.
  - Three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition.
  - The remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Working through the conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - S must be first or second.
  - If S is first, then Q must be third, and R must be fifth or seventh.
  - If S is second, then Q must be fourth, and R must be sixth.
  - If Y is fourth, then S must be first or second, and Q must be third or fourth.
  - If Q is third, then S must be first, and R must be fifth or seventh.
  - If Q is fourth, then S must be second, and R must be sixth.
  - If J is first, then G must be second, and R must be fourth or seventh.
  - If G is second, then J must be first, and R must be fourth or seventh.
  - If R is fourth, then J must be third, and G must be second.
  - If R is sixth, then J must be fifth, and G must be fourth.
  
From the above, we can see that the only option that is necessarily true is:
Action: Answer("D") Q is third.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the articles is: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
  G, H, and J cover finance.
  Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  Y covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order is: _ _ _ Y _ _ _.
  S must be earlier than Y, so S cannot be fourth.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other, so the fourth article cannot be Q or R.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, so J cannot be fourth.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Y is fourth, then the order is: _ _ _ Y _ _ _.
  S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first, second, or third.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other, so the first three articles must be Q, R, and S in some order.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, so J must be fifth, sixth, or seventh and G must be sixth or seventh.
  Since the third article is S, and S cannot be followed by Q, the order must be Q, R, S.
  Therefore, the order is Q, R, S, Y, G, H, J.
  Thus, Q is the first article, and Q is third. Therefore, the answer is D: Q is third.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles must be: Q, R, S, G, H, J, Y.
  If Y is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  The remaining articles, H and Y, must be edited after J.
  Therefore, the order must be: Q, R, S, G, H, J, Y.

Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, Q must be first if Y is fourth.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The articles can be ordered as follows: Q-R-S-G-H-J-Y.
  If Y is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S in some order.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, so J must be either first or second.
  If J is first, then G must be second, and the order of the articles that cover nutrition must be Q-S-R, which is not allowed. Therefore, J must be second.
  The articles covering nutrition must be in the order Q-S-R.
  Y must be last.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles are about finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles are about nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article is about wildlife: Y.
  If two articles are consecutive, they cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then S must be first or second. Q must be third. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. 
  
  A: J cannot be second because G must be earlier than J.
  B: J cannot be third because G must be earlier than J.
  C: Q must be third, so this could be true.
  D: Q must be third, so this is true.
  E: R must be seventh, so this could be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  We need to edit 7 articles, 3 about finance, 3 about nutrition, and 1 about wildlife.
  We cannot edit consecutive articles about the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S must be either first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, but that would mean that we would need to edit two consecutive articles about nutrition, which is not allowed.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, but that would mean that we would need to edit two consecutive articles about nutrition, which is not allowed.
  If S is third, then Q can be either first or second, but if Q is first, then R must be fifth, and if Q is second, then R must be sixth.
  If J is earlier than G and G is earlier than R, then J must be either first or second, and R must be either sixth or seventh.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q must be third, and R must be sixth. J cannot be second because it would violate the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.

Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?
Choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
  C: the western, the horror film
  D: the western, the mystery
  E: the western, the sci-fi film
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  - Screen 1 shows two movies, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.

Eliminating options based on the given conditions: 
  - Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, options B, C, and D can be eliminated.
  - Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, option A can be eliminated. 

Checking the remaining option:
  - Option E: The western, the sci-fi film
    - This option is possible. The western can be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1, followed by the sci-fi film at 9 P.M. on screen 1.

Action: Answer("A")  
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Elimination:
  The western must be shown on screen 1 or 2 because it starts before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 1.
  
  A: The sci-fi film and horror film are both shown on screen 1, violating the rule that the horror film and mystery cannot be shown on the same screen. Eliminated.
  B: The sci-fi film is shown on screen 1, and the mystery is not shown on screen 1. This is possible.
  C: The western is shown on screen 1, and the horror film is not shown on screen 1. This is possible.
  D: The western is shown on screen 1, and the mystery is not shown on screen 1. This is possible.
  E: The western and sci-fi film are both shown on screen 1, violating the rule that the sci-fi film and romance cannot be shown on the same screen. Eliminated.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screen 1 shows two movies, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the mystery is shown on screen 1, then the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1, since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. This eliminates choices A and C. 
  If the western is shown on screen 1, then the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1, since the western begins before the horror film. This eliminates choice D. 
  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1, then the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1, since the horror film and the sci-fi film are not shown on the same screen. This eliminates choice E. 
  Therefore, the only remaining choice is B, which cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie.
  Screen 1 has a 7 PM movie and a 9 PM movie.
  Screen 2 has a 7 PM movie and a 9 PM movie.
  Screen 3 has an 8 PM movie.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  Since screen 1 has a 7 PM movie and a 9 PM movie, and there are five movies, one of the movies must not be shown on screen 1. We need to check which options violate the given conditions.

A: The sci-fi film and the horror film are shown on screen 1. This option does not violate any of the given conditions.

B: The sci-fi film and the mystery are shown on screen 1. This option does not violate any of the given conditions.

C: The western and the horror film are shown on screen 1. This option violates the condition that the western begins before the horror film. Therefore, this option cannot be accurate.

D: The western and the mystery are shown on screen 1. This option does not violate any of the given conditions.

E: The western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1. This option violates the condition that the western begins before the horror film. Therefore, this option cannot be accurate.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Screen 1 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  - Since screen 1 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., the movie shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1 cannot be the same as the movie shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2.
  - Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, they cannot be both on screen 1.
  - Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, it cannot be on screen 1 either.
  - The western must be on screen 1 or 2, and it must be before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film cannot be on screen 3, so it must be on screen 1 or 2.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the mystery cannot be on screen 1 at 9 P.M. because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the list "the sci-fi film, the mystery" cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  According to the given conditions, the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 because screen 1 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M. Hence, in option B, the horror film is shown on screen 1 along with the sci-fi film, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, option B cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Elimination:
  The western must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  The romance cannot be shown on screen 2.
  The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
  The horror film and the mystery must be shown on different screens.
  Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  
Test:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film -> This is possible, since the horror film can be shown on screen 2.
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery -> This is possible, since the mystery can be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  C: the western, the horror film -> This is possible, since the western can be shown on screen 1 and the horror film on screen 2.
  D: the western, the mystery -> This is possible, since the western can be shown on screen 1 and the mystery on screen 2.
  E: the western, the sci-fi film -> This is not possible, since the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3 and it is not shown on screen 1 or 2 with the western.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
Eliminating the options that violate the given conditions:
  A: The western cannot be shown on screen 1 before the horror film, so this option is not possible.
  B: Possible, since the sci-fi film and the mystery can be shown on screens 1 and 2, in any order.
  C: Possible, since the western and the horror film can be shown on screens 1 and 2, in any order.
  D: Possible, since the western and the mystery can be shown on screens 1 and 2, in any order.
  E: Possible, since the western can be shown on screen 1 and the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 2.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies showing at the theater: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  There are three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 each show two movies each, one at 7 P.M. and one at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  We need to check which of the options cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
  We know that the romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so we can't have both of them on screen 1.
  The western must be shown before the horror film, so the western cannot be the 9 P.M. movie on screen 1.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis: 
  Since the western must be shown before the horror film, we can eliminate options A and B because they both have the horror film shown before the sci-fi film, which is not possible. 
  Option C is possible because the western can be shown at 7 P.M. and the horror film at 9 P.M. on screen 1. 
  Option D is possible because the western can be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1 and the mystery can be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2. 
  Option E is not possible because the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, and it is the only option left to be paired with the western on screen 1.

- There are 7 days, so each combination must be featured once and only once.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so any combination featuring Greyhounds must include day 1.
- No breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, so any combination featuring a certain breed on day X cannot feature the same breed on day X+1 or X-1.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, so any combination featuring a certain breed on day 1 cannot feature the same breed on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, so any combination featuring Himalayans must include exactly 2 of days 2-6.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, so any combination featuring Rottweilers cannot include day 7 or any of the 3 days that feature Himalayans.

- Since there are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies, there are a total of 6 breeds that will be featured in the seven days.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on any other day that is not day 1. Therefore, B and C are not possible.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, Himalayans cannot be featured on days 1, 2, and 7. 
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers cannot be featured on days 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Based on the above analysis, it is possible that each of the 6 breeds is featured on three days, but not necessarily exactly four breeds. Therefore, A is possible.
- Based on the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, it is possible that Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not. Therefore, E is possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company sets service targets for three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days. According to the conditions, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days and Truvest's website target is 3 days. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is 1 day. Therefore, Image's website target must also be 1 day. This means that all the options are true except for Option A, which states that Image's website target is 1 day, which is actually true. So, the answer is Option A.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company sets two service targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - Targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then:
  - Image's voicemail target is either 2 days or 1 day.
  - Solide's voicemail target is either 2 days or 1 day.
  - Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 1 day.
  
  Based on the conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - Image's website target cannot be 3 days, so it must be either 2 days or 1 day.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Since Truvest's website target cannot be 1 day, Solide's website target must be 2 days.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Solide's voicemail target cannot be 1 day, and Truvest's voicemail target cannot be 1 day.
  
  Therefore, the answer to this question is A: Image's website target is 1 day. This is not necessarily true, as Image's website target could be 2 days. The other statements are true based on the given conditions. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - There are two service targets for each client: one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The service targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("D")

If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then it means that the longest voicemail target is 2 days. This means that the following statements must be true:
- Image's voicemail target is 1 day (because it must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets).
- Solide's voicemail target is 2 days (because it cannot be longer than 2 days).
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- Truvest's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days (because neither of those is longer than 2 days).
- Truvest's website target can be either 2 days or 3 days (because it cannot be shorter than Solide's website target).

Therefore, the only statement that does not have to be true is D: Truvest's website target is 2 days. It could be 3 days if Truvest's voicemail target is 1 day.

  - Solide's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - Truvest's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - None of the clients' website targets can be longer than their voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

  C: Solide's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target must be 3 days as it cannot be shorter than its voicemail target, which is either 1 day or 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days.
  
  Therefore, the answer is A: Image's website target is not necessarily 1 day.

- The targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, it means that the longest voicemail target is 2 days.

Analysis:
- Option A: If Image's website target is 1 day, it means that its voicemail target must be shorter than 1 day, which is not possible because the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Therefore, option A is false.
- Option B: If Solide's website target is 2 days, it means that Truvest's website target must be 1 day because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, option B is true.
- Option C: If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, it means that Image's voicemail target must be 1 day because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, option C is true.
- Option D: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, it means that Solide's website target must be 3 days because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, option D is false.
- Option E: If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, it means that Image's voicemail target must be 1 day because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, option E is true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

    - Image's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
    - Solide's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
    - Truvest's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 3 days, which means that it must be either 1 day or 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, we know that Solide's and Truvest's voicemail targets must be at least 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which means that Solide's website target must be 2 days and Truvest's website target must be 3 days. This leaves Image's website target, which must be 1 day according to the first condition. Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is A: Image's website target is 1 day, because it is a fixed value according to the first condition.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The maintenance company sets two service targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A") 

If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, it means that the longest voicemail target is 2 days. This also means that the longest website target is 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, the only option that cannot be true is that Image's website target is 1 day (option A). Therefore, the answer is A.
Response 8:

  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, it means that the maximum voicemail target is 2 days.
  
Analysis:
  A: If Image's website target is 1 day, it means that the voicemail target of Image must be 1 day or less, which contradicts the given condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  B: If Solide's website target is 2 days, it means that Truvest's website target must be 3 days or longer, which contradicts the given condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  C: If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, it is consistent with the given condition that none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days.
  D: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, it means that Solide's website target must be 1 day or shorter, which contradicts the given condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  E: If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, it is consistent with the given condition that none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days.
  
Therefore, the answer is A: Image's website target is 1 day.

  - Hue has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Sports section.
  - Hue has the same number of photographs in the Lifestyle section as Fuentes has in the Sports section.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. Not possible because Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. Not possible because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. Possible, because one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. This means that the other photograph in the Lifestyle section is taken by Gagnon. To satisfy the constraints, Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section, which means that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. Not possible because Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - At least one photograph in the Metro section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is one.
  - The number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section is one.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. (Not possible, because at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.)
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. (Not possible, because there are only three photographers and each photographer can have at most three photographs.)
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. (Possible, because one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, and at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.)
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. (Not possible, because the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section is one.)
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. (Possible, because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is one, and the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section is one.)
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs will appear in total, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Three photographers are available: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section that is by either Fuentes or Hue, due to the constraint that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, option A is not possible. 
Option B is not possible because none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. 
Option D is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, then one photograph in the Sports section must also be by Fuentes.
Option E is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must also be by Hue. 
Therefore, option C is the only one that could be true: exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, with exactly two photographs per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Analysis:
  - If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be taken by Gagnon.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, either Fuentes or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Since there is one photograph by each in the Lifestyle section, there must be one photograph by each in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, as either Fuentes or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- There are six photographs in total, with two photographs in each section: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue. Therefore, (A) and (B) are not possible because they both imply that both photographs in the Metro section are by the same photographer. (D) is not possible because it would mean that there are two photographs by Hue in the Sports section, which violates the rule that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. (E) is not possible because the question states that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, but it does not say that the other photograph in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Hue. Therefore, (C) is the only possible option, as it allows for one photograph in the Metro section to be by Hue while still meeting all of the other constraints.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Photographs are taken by Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
    - The other two Lifestyle photographs are taken by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
    - The two Sports photographs are taken by Hue and Fuentes.
    - The two Metro photographs can be taken by any combination of the three photographers as long as the conditions are met.
    
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. Not possible because there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by a photographer other than Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. Not possible because there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. Possible, as long as the other photograph in the Metro section is taken by a photographer other than Hue or Fuentes.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Not possible because there must be one photograph in the Sports section taken by Fuentes.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. Not possible because one photograph in the Sports section must be taken by Hue.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- There are six different photographs, exactly two photographs per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is because a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section must also have a photograph in the Lifestyle section, and Fuentes already has one in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, Hue must have a photograph in the Lifestyle section, and it is possible that the other photograph in the Metro section is by a different photographer, such as Gagnon.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) should have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - There are two photographers left: Gagnon and Hue.
  - Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Sports section, and therefore Hue must also have at least one photograph in the Sports section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, if Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must also have one photograph in the Sports section.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. If Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Hue must also have one photograph in the Metro section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  Based on these conditions, the only possible choice is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, Sports) will have two photographs, and each photograph is taken by one of the three photographers.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
- The remaining four photographs are taken by Gagnon and Fuentes or Hue.
- At least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. (Not possible because at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.)
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. (Not possible because at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.)
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. (Possible, as long as the other photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.)
D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. (Not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.)
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. (Possible, as long as both photographs in the Sports section are by Fuentes.)

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Six photographs in total, two per section in three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Constraints:
    - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs.
    - At least one Lifestyle photograph must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
    - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
    - No Gagnon photographs can be in the Sports section.
  - If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the other Lifestyle photograph must be by Gagnon.
  - The number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the other Lifestyle photograph must be by Gagnon. That means there are no more photographs by Fuentes or Hue available for the Metro section. Therefore, the only possibility is that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This satisfies the constraint that at least one Lifestyle photograph must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The other Metro photograph must be by Gagnon. Therefore, neither photograph in the Sports section can be by Hue (since Fuentes already has a photograph in the Sports section), which eliminates choices D and E. Furthermore, since no Gagnon photographs can be in the Sports section, choice B is also eliminated. Finally, since Fuentes already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, choice A is also eliminated. Therefore, the only possible choice is C.

Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. This does not affect Mollie's assignment.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. This would mean Mollie must be assigned to 1922, which satisfies the condition.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. This does not affect Mollie's assignment.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. This means Louis must be assigned to the remaining year, which does not satisfy the condition that Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. This does not affect Mollie's assignment.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. No information is provided about Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, or Tiffany.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. No information is provided about Mollie, Louis, Ryan, or Tiffany.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. No information is provided about Mollie, Louis, Ryan, or Tiffany.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923. No information is provided about Louis, Onyx, Ryan, or Yoshio.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. No information is provided about Mollie, Louis, Onyx, Ryan, or Tiffany.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is not assigned to 1923, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This means that Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921, so he must be assigned to 1924. If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922 because she cannot be assigned to the same year as Onyx, and she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. However, if Louis is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, and therefore Onyx must be assigned to 1922, which means Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, and therefore Ryan must be assigned to the project, and therefore Onyx must be assigned to 1921.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then the other student assigned to the project with Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1924. If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then the remaining students must be assigned to 1923 and 1924. However, only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923 if Mollie is assigned to 1922. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921, which means that Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if Onyx is assigned to 1924. This is because if Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining students must be assigned to 1923 and 1924. However, only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 if Louis is assigned to 1924. Therefore, Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1921 because if Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922, and Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 if Yoshio is assigned to 1921. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  A: We don't know who will be assigned to 1922 and 1923, so we cannot determine if Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  B: If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 because of the condition that Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  C: If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923. However, only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so this condition is impossible.
  D: If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Louis must be assigned to 1924. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 because Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  E: If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922 because Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. This does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment or the assignment of the other students.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. This means that Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921, so she must be assigned to 1922. This satisfies the condition that "If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922."
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. This does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment or the assignment of the other students.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. This means that Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, so he must be assigned to either 1921, 1922, or 1924. This does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment or the assignment of the other students.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. This does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment or the assignment of the other students.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years will be assigned to Onyx, Ryan, and Louis/Tiffany. But if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must also be assigned to the project, leaving only Louis and Onyx to be assigned to 1924 and 1922, respectively. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921.
- If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then the remaining years will be assigned to Onyx, Ryan, and Louis/Tiffany. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must also be assigned to the project, leaving only Louis to be assigned to 1923. If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Onyx will be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if Louis is assigned to 1924.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
- A: Louis is assigned to 1924. This condition does not affect Mollie's assignment.
- B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. This condition does not affect Mollie's assignment.
- C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. This condition does not affect Mollie's assignment.
- D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. This condition affects Mollie's assignment because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
- E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. This condition does not affect Mollie's assignment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
- There are four years to be assigned and four students to assign, with each year assigned to exactly one student.

Reasoning:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then there are two remaining years to be assigned: 1923 and 1924. 
- If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Louis must be assigned to 1924 and Ryan must be assigned to 1922. However, this leaves Onyx with no year to be assigned to, which is not allowed. 
- Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923. 
- If Ryan is assigned to 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to 1921. This leaves Louis with 1924 and Tiffany with 1923, which is allowed.
- If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922 and Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. This leaves Ryan with 1924 and Louis with no year to be assigned to, which is not allowed.
- Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921.
- If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923. This leaves Louis with 1922 and Mollie with 1921, which is allowed.
- Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if Onyx is assigned to 1924.

Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then we know that the bay holding textiles is either bay 3 or bay 5. 
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the bay holding fuel must be either bay 1 or bay 2.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so the bay holding livestock must be either bay 1 or bay 2.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain must be either bay 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1 and 2 are not completely determined.
Action: Answer("4")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  Bay holding produce is higher than the bay holding fuel.
  Bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are six types of cargo, and each bay is holding a different type of cargo.
  
Solution:
  From the given information, we can determine the following order of bays from left to right: fuel, textiles, produce, livestock, grain, machinery.
  Therefore, for exactly 3 bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined: bays 3, 5, and 6.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  From the given information, we know that:
  - Bay 4 is holding produce.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, bay 1 cannot be holding produce.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Therefore, bay 3 must be holding textiles.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, bay 2 must be holding livestock and bay 5 must be holding grain.
  So, for exactly four of the six bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined: 
  - Bay 2 is holding livestock.
  - Bay 3 is holding textiles.
  - Bay 4 is holding produce.
  - Bay 5 is holding grain.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  From the given information, we know that:
    - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
    - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
    - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
    - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Therefore, we can deduce that:
    - The bay holding livestock must be either bay 2 or bay 3 if the bay holding textiles is bay 3.
    - The bay holding livestock must be either bay 4 or bay 5 if the bay holding textiles is bay 5.
    - The bay holding grain must be either bay 1 or bay 2 if the bay holding livestock is bay 2.
    - The bay holding grain must be either bay 2 or bay 3 if the bay holding livestock is bay 3.
    - The bay holding fuel must be either bay 1 or bay 2 if the bay holding produce is bay 6.
    - The bay holding fuel must be either bay 2 or bay 3 if the bay holding produce is bay 5.
    - The bay holding fuel must be either bay 3 or bay 4 if the bay holding produce is bay 4.
  Therefore, if bay 4 is holding produce, then the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined, as well as the type of cargo held in bays 3, 5, and 6. The types of cargo held in bays 1 and 2 are not completely determined.
Action: Answer("4")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.

To determine the answer, we can use the given information to deduce the type of cargo held in each bay. We know that bay 4 holds produce, and the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, bay 5 must hold fuel. We also know that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so bay 3 must hold textiles. We know that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so bay 2 must hold livestock. We know that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so bay 1 must hold grain. Therefore, the type of cargo held in each bay is completely determined.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  
Reasoning:
  We know that bay 4 is holding produce and the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so we can deduce that bay 5 is holding fuel.
  We also know that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the only possible location for textiles is bay 3.
  We know that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so the only possible location for livestock is bay 2.
  We know that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the only possible location for grain is bay 1.
  Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is completely determined, which is a total of 5 bays.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles is either bay 3 or bay 5. If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock is bay 2 and the bay holding grain is bay 1. If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock is bay 6 and the bay holding grain is bay 1.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the bay holding produce must be bay 4 or bay 6.
  Therefore, if bay 4 is holding produce, then the bays holding livestock and grain must be determined. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles is either bay 3 or bay 5. 
  The bay holding produce is bay 4.
  The bay holding livestock is either bay 2, bay 3, or bay 5.
  The bay holding grain is either bay 1, bay 2, bay 3, or bay 5.
  The bay holding fuel is either bay 1 or bay 2.
  The bay holding machinery is either bay 1 or bay 6.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then bay 3 is holding textiles.
  There are two bays between bay 3 and bay 4, so bay 2 and bay 5 must be fuel and livestock, but it is unknown which one is which.
  The bay holding grain must be either bay 1 or bay 6, but it is unknown which one is which.
  The six types of cargo are: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
Action: Answer("B")  
If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding fuel must be bay 1, and the bay holding grain must be bay 6. Therefore, the types of cargo for bays 1, 4, and 6 are completely determined.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.

Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The research team will include at least four employees from eight possible employees.
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  
Analysis:
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Therefore, if Myers is selected, we can eliminate Ortega and Paine from the list of possible employees for the team.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Therefore, if Schmidt is selected, we must also select Paine and Thomson for the team.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, if Wong is selected, we must also select Myers and Yoder for the team.
  - We need a team of at least four employees. 

Solution:
  - Let's go through each option:
    - Option A: Myers is selected, so we cannot select Ortega or Paine. Schmidt is selected, so we must select Paine and Thomson. Therefore, this option is not possible.
    - Option B: Ortega and Paine are selected, so Myers cannot be selected. Schmidt is not selected, so Paine and Thomson cannot be selected. Therefore, this option is not possible.
    - Option C: Paine and Yoder are selected, so Myers cannot be selected. Schmidt is selected, so we must select Paine and Thomson. Therefore, this option is possible.
    - Option D: Schmidt is selected, so we must select Paine and Thomson. Yoder and Zayre are also selected. Therefore, this option is possible.
    - Option E: Wong is selected, so we must select Myers and Yoder. Zayre is also selected. Therefore, this option is possible.
  - Options C, D, and E are possible selections.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The company employs exactly seven sales representatives.
  - The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 2 must be the lowest.
  - If one of the sales representatives is assigned to a zone, then the other two sales representatives cannot be assigned to the same zone.
  - If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Udall must work in Zone 2. This would mean that there are more sales representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information.
  - If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well, which would mean that there are only two sales representatives in Zone 1, which again contradicts the given information.
  - If Kim or Mahr works in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall cannot both work in Zone 2, which would mean that there are only two sales representatives in Zone 2, which again contradicts the given information.
  - Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall and Stuckey work in Zone 3. This would mean that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The software company employs seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives in Zone 2 is less than the number of sales representatives in Zone 1, because the total number of sales representatives is seven.
  - From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. So, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, because if Tiao works in Zone 1, then there will be at most one sales representative in Zone 2, which is less than the number of sales representatives in Zone 1.
  - Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1, and Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, and Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  - Now, we have three sales representatives left: Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey (because Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, and Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, and Tiao works in Zone 2).
  - From the given conditions, we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so either two or three sales representatives work in Zone 3, and either zero or one sales representative works in Zone 2.
  - Therefore, Kim and Mahr work in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone (because they cannot work in Zone 2, as there is at most one sales representative in Zone 2).
  - So, the only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives in Zone 2 must be less than the number of sales representatives in Zone 1. 
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. So, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, because that would mean there are more sales representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra must work in Zone 1, and Udall must work in Zone 2. 
  Also, from the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. So, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2. This means that there are at most 3 sales representatives in Zone 3. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly 7 sales representatives.
  - There are exactly 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 cannot be the zone with the least number of sales representatives.

Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 2 must have exactly two sales representatives.
  - If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1. But this would mean that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition. So Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  - If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 2. This leaves Zone 1 with only one representative, which again contradicts the given condition. So Udall cannot work in Zone 3.
  - This means that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and the other works in Zone 3. Also, neither Stuckey nor Udall works in Zone 3.
  - If Kim or Mahr works in Zone 2, then the other one must work in Zone 1, which means that Zone 3 has at most two representatives. So neither Kim nor Mahr can work in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then:
  - Parra cannot work in Zone 1, because if she did, then Tiao would have to work in Zone 2, which would mean that there are more sales representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information.
  - Tiao must work in Zone 1, because if he worked in Zone 2, then Udall would have to work in Zone 3, which would mean that there are more sales representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information.
  - Udall cannot work in Zone 1, because Tiao is already assigned to that zone.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, which means that they both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  - Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall, which means that they both work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  - If Mahr works in Zone 2, then Kim would have to work in Zone 1, which would mean that there are more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information.
  - Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both.
- Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
- More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("D")

If Tiao works in Zone 2, Udall must work in Zone 3, and Parra must work in Zone 1. This would mean that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 2. This means Udall must work in Zone 2, and Parra must work in Zone 1. If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Quinn must work in Zone 3, and Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 1. So, the answer is D.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives that work in 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then it is impossible for both Parra and Tiao to work in Zone 1, since only one of them can work in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3. Parra and Quinn must work in the same zone, so they cannot both work in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 3 and Quinn works in the same zone as Parra. Stuckey must work in the same zone as Udall, which is Zone 3. Kim and Mahr are the only sales representatives left, so one of them must work in Zone 1 and the other must work in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 must have at least 3 sales representatives.
  
Eliminating choices:
  - A: We don't know where Kim works.
  - B: We don't know where Mahr works.
  - C: If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 1. However, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  - D: If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in another zone (either Zone 2 or Zone 3). If Parra works in Zone 3, then there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Parra must work in Zone 2 if Tiao works in Zone 1. However, we don't know whether Tiao works in Zone 1 or not.
  - E: If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey works in Zone 3 as well. However, we don't know whether there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at least three sales representatives in Zone 1.
  - From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  - If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3 and Udall works in Zone 2, which would mean that there are more sales representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  - Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2. This means that Udall works in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Quinn work in the same zone as Udall. Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 3 as well.
  - Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 must have at least 3 sales representatives (since there are only 7 sales representatives in total). 
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2. But then, there can be at most one sales representative in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1.
  Also, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Quinn and Parra work in Zone 1, and Stuckey and Udall work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. 
  Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there are already 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, there can be at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 2, which means that Udall works in Zone 2. This also means that Stuckey works in Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra works in Zone 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  Each rider will test one bicycle each day, and all bicycles will be tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  
Analysis:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day.
  Therefore, Yuki cannot test J on the first day, and Reynaldo cannot test J on the second day.
  Theresa cannot test H on the first day because she is testing J.
  Seamus cannot test H on the first day because he is testing J on the second day.
  Therefore, Yuki must test H on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day because he cannot test F on the first day.
  Seamus cannot test H on the first day because he is testing J on the second day.
  Therefore, Theresa must test G on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  * Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.
  * Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  * Reynaldo cannot test F.
  * Yuki cannot test J.
  * Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  * The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("D")
  
Explanation:
If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test F on the first day, because Reynaldo cannot test F. Then Reynaldo must test H on the first day, because Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Yuki must test G on the first day. On the second day, Seamus must test Yuki's bicycle from the first day, which is G. Therefore, Seamus cannot be one of the testers for J, and Yuki cannot test H on the second day because she tested it on the first day. The only remaining option is that Seamus is one of the testers for J. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  - There are four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider will test one bicycle on the first day and a different bicycle on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Action: 
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then:
  - Yuki must test H on the first day (because she cannot test J).
  - Seamus must test J on the second day (because Yuki tests H on the first day).
  - Theresa cannot test G on the second day (because she tests J on the first day).
  - Reynaldo cannot test F on the second day (because he cannot test F).
  - Seamus cannot test H on the first day (because Theresa must test H).
  
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is:
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. 
  
  Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are 4 riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  There are 4 bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider tests one bicycle each day.
  Each bicycle is tested by one rider each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must test H on one of the days.
  Yuki tests a bicycle on day 1 that Seamus tests on day 2.
  If Theresa tests J on day 1, then Seamus cannot test J on day 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Theresa cannot test H on the first day.
  Therefore, Theresa must test H on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test H on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test G on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J, so she must test F on the first day.
  Therefore, Yuki tests H on the second day.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will each test one of four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) on the first day.
  - Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("D")
If Theresa tests J on the first day, the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be H (since Yuki cannot test J). Therefore, Seamus must test H on the second day (since the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day). This means that Seamus cannot be one of the testers for J, so D is the only option that could be true.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day. This means Seamus must test J on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day.
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day is not possible because Reynaldo cannot test F, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day is not possible because Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day is not possible because Theresa tests J on the first day, and Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J is possible because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G is not possible because Reynaldo cannot test F, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  5. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  6. Theresa tests J on the first day.
  
Analysis: 
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki must test one of F, G, or H on the first day. Then, Seamus must test J on the second day. Therefore, H must be tested by Reynaldo on the second day. This leaves Seamus to test either F or G on the first day, and Reynaldo to test either F or G on the first day.
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. Possible.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day. Impossible, because Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. Impossible, because Yuki cannot test J, which must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. Impossible, because Yuki must test J on the first day and Seamus must test J on the second day.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. Possible.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  - Four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider tests one bicycle on each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - Yuki tests a bicycle on the first day that Seamus tests on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo must test H on the first day.
  
Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo must test H on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day. 
  - Seamus tests a bicycle on the second day that Yuki tests on the first day. Therefore, Seamus cannot test H on the first day. 
  - Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test G on the first day. Therefore, Seamus must test J on the second day. 
  - Theresa must test H, so Theresa cannot test G on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki will test four bicycles F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider will test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then H must be tested by Yuki on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test F on the first day.
  Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  On the second day, Reynaldo will test J, Seamus will test H, Theresa will test G, and Yuki will test F.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  5. Each rider will test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  6. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then:
  - Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day (because he cannot test F and all four bicycles are tested each day).
  - Seamus cannot test H on the first day (because Theresa must be one of the testers for H).
  - Yuki cannot test H on the second day (because she cannot test J and all four bicycles are tested each day).
  - Seamus cannot be one of the testers for J (because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day).
  - Theresa cannot be one of the testers for G (because she tests J on the first day and all four bicycles are tested each day).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are 8 students in the seminar.
  Exactly 6 students will give individual oral reports.
  The reports will be given during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Exactly 2 reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are 6 students left to give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, he must give a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports on Monday and Wednesday in some order.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Analysis:
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday or Monday, because that would force Helen and Irving to give reports on the following day, which would exceed the limit of two reports per day. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday and Tuesday in some order. Since George must give a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday. Therefore, George, Helen, and Irving must give reports on Monday and Tuesday in some order.
  Olivia and Robert must give morning reports on Monday and Wednesday in some order. Since George, Helen, and Irving are already giving reports on Monday, then Olivia and Robert must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by George, Helen, and Irving.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are six students left who will give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  
Solution:
  1. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are six students left who will give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  2. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, then George must give a report on Tuesday.
  3. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, then both Olivia and Robert must give a report in the morning.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, otherwise, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
  5. If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
  6. Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are three morning reports left for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  7. From 4 and 5, we know that Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, then she must give a report on Monday or Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then there are no constraints on Tuesday's reports. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  8. From 3, we know that both Olivia and Robert must give a report in the morning, then Helen and Irving must give reports in the afternoon.
  9. From 2 and 7, we know that George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Wednesday, and Kyle and Lenore do not give reports. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Answer("D") Olivia, Robert, and Irving. 

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  We need to determine which three students will give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, given that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly six students will give reports, so two of the eight students will not give reports.
  We know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  We know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Solution:
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We know that George must give his report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must both give morning reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. This means that either Nina's report is given on Wednesday, or Nina's report is given on Monday and Helen and Irving's reports are given on Wednesday.
  If Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving's reports must be given on Monday. This means that the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  If Nina's report is given on Monday, then Helen and Irving's reports must be given on Wednesday. This means that the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Olivia, George, and Robert.
  
  Thus, the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, are:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina (not possible)
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen (not possible)
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia (possible if Nina's report is given on Wednesday)
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving (not possible)
  E: Robert, George, and Helen (possible if Nina's report is given on Monday)
  
  Since both C and E are possible, the answer is None of the Above.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  We are looking for a possible order of morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  We are also given that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, but we are not given any other information about who does give reports.
  
Analysis: 
  Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we know that the six people who do give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We can start by placing George in the Tuesday morning slot, since that is the only day he can give a report.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must both give morning reports. 
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, or else Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday, and Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday. 
  This leaves us with the following order of morning reports: 
  Monday: Helen and Irving
  Tuesday: George and Olivia
  Wednesday: Nina and Robert

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students who will give the reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. 
  From condition 3, George will give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, George cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday. 
  From condition 4, Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, they will give morning reports on two of the three days.
  From condition 5, if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday. 
  
  Possible morning reports on Monday: George, Helen, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Possible morning reports on Tuesday: Helen, Irving, Nina, and Robert.
  Possible morning reports on Wednesday: George, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  
  The only set of morning reports that does not include Kyle and Lenore is (George, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert) on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are three consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  From condition 6, we know that Kyle and Lenore will not give reports. Therefore, they cannot be morning reports on any day.
  From condition 3, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, he cannot be a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  From condition 4, we know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, they must give morning reports.
  From condition 5, we know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give morning reports on Wednesday.
  From condition 2, we know that there are only two reports in the morning and two in the afternoon each day. Therefore, there cannot be more than two morning reports on any day.
  
  A: Helen cannot be a morning report on Monday because she must give a morning report on Wednesday if Nina gives a report. Therefore, A is not possible.
  B: Irving and Helen cannot be morning reports on Monday and Tuesday because they must give morning reports on Wednesday if Nina gives a report. Therefore, B is not possible.
  C: This is possible. Nina cannot give a report because Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give morning reports on Thursday. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Olivia, Robert, and Nina.
  D: Robert cannot be a morning report on any day because he cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, D is not possible.
  E: George cannot be a morning report on Monday because he can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, E is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  We need to determine the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, which means we are looking for three students who will give reports in the morning.
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina - George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this option is not possible.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so this option is not possible.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so this option is not possible.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so this option is not possible.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen - George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this option is not possible.
  
  None of the above options are possible.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. The seminar has eight students.
  2. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  4. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  5. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  6. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  7. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
Solution:
  From the given information, we can deduce that George must give his report on Tuesday and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, Olivia and Robert must give their reports in the morning. As Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the students who can give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, and Olivia. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday. So, Nina must give her report on Monday or Wednesday. If Nina's report is given on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. But George is already giving his report on Tuesday, so this is not possible. Therefore, Nina's report must be given on Wednesday. So, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Robert and Olivia, George and Helen, and Irving and Nina.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. There are eight students in the seminar: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  2. Exactly six students will give oral reports during three consecutive days.
  3. Exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  4. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  5. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  6. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  7. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. 
  
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, the morning reports on Tuesday and Wednesday must be given by George and one of Nina, Helen, or Irving. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that either Nina gives a report on Wednesday, or Helen and Irving both give morning reports on Wednesday. 
  
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina (incorrect, because Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday)
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen (incorrect, because Robert cannot give an afternoon report)
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia (incorrect, because Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday)
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving (incorrect, because Robert cannot give an afternoon report)
  E: Robert, George, and Helen (correct, because George gives a report on Tuesday, and the morning reports on Wednesday can be given by Helen and Irving) 
  
  Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. The schedule consists of 2 reports per day for 3 consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
  2. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  3. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  5. If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only 6 people left to give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.

Solution:
  1. If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only 6 people left to give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  2. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report. Therefore, George must give a report on Tuesday.
  3. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, Olivia and Robert must give their reports in the morning.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, otherwise, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
  5. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  6. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. But George is already giving a report on Tuesday, so Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. This means that Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday. But this is not possible because neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  7. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. This means that Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, they must give reports on Tuesday. This means that Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday.
  8. The morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Robert, George, and Helen.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  
Analysis:
  If I is placed on the middle shelf, then there are only two shelves left for the other seven books. So, the bottom shelf must have at least three books, and the top shelf must have at most two books.
  If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the top or middle shelf, and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top or middle shelf, and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other, then H and O must be on the top or middle shelf, and L and F must be on the bottom shelf. However, we cannot determine whether K, G, and I are on the top or middle shelf in this case.
  If any of the other options were true, we would still not be able to determine the placement of all the books.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O)
  - There are 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom)
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is on the middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M
  - At least two books are on each shelf
  - We need to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on
  
Analysis:
  - If I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, we know that F must be on a different shelf since it is on the same shelf as M. We also know that I is on the middle shelf, so the remaining two books (G, H) must be on the top shelf and the remaining three books (K, L, O) must be on the bottom shelf. This satisfies all the conditions, so the answer is A.
  - If K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other, we don't know where F, M, and H are placed. This is not enough information, so B is not the answer.
  - If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, we don't know where O, K, G, I, and H are placed. This is not enough information, so C is not the answer.
  - If M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, we don't know where F, I, K, G, L, and O are placed. This is not enough information, so D is not the answer.
  - If H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other, we don't know where F, G, I, K, L, and M are placed. This is not enough information, so E is not the answer.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  If I is on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least two books, and the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle or the bottom shelf.
  If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the middle or the bottom shelf.
  If F is on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be either both on the middle shelf or both on the bottom shelf.
  If any of the pairs in the answer choices are on the same shelf, then it is not enough to determine which shelf each of the books is placed on.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.

  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, it is fully determined that H and O are on the same shelf, but it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the other books is placed on.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F is placed. We only know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, but we don't know which shelf that is. So, this statement is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, H, I, L, and O are placed. So, this statement is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M is also on that shelf, according to the condition "F is placed on the same shelf as M." However, we still don't know where H, I, K, and O are placed. So, this statement is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, G, I, K, L, and O are placed. So, this statement is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that L and F are not on the same shelf as H and O, according to the condition "O is placed on a higher shelf than L" and "More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf." So, L and F must be on the same shelf as I, which is the middle shelf. Then, K must be on the top shelf and G must be on the same shelf as H and O, which is the bottom shelf. So, this statement is enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - If I is on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least 2 books, and the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - If F is on the same shelf as M, then they must be on the top or bottom shelf together.
  - If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the top or middle shelf, and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top or middle shelf, and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - If H is on the same shelf as O, then they must be on the top or middle shelf together.
  - If G is on the same shelf as K, then they must be on the middle or bottom shelf together.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  - If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, then they must be on the middle or bottom shelf together.
  - From the given conditions, we know that I is on the middle shelf, and K is on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, K and F cannot be on the same shelf as each other.
  - We also know that O is on a higher shelf than L, and F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, O and M cannot be on the same shelf as each other.
  - Thus, the only remaining books that could be on the same shelf as F are G and H, which must be on the top shelf together. This leaves L and O to be on the middle and bottom shelves, respectively. Therefore, the placement of the books is fully determined if L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and I is on the middle shelf, then we know that H and G must be on the top shelf, and K, L, F, M, and O must be on the bottom shelf.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, and K is on a higher shelf than F, then H and O must be on the top shelf, and the remaining books must be on the other two shelves.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F is placed, since F can be on the same shelf as I and M or on a different shelf, so this statement is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, H, I, L, and O are placed, since they can be placed on any of the 2 remaining shelves, so this statement is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M is also on the same shelf, because F is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K, I, and O are on the other shelf, since K is on a higher shelf than F, I is on the middle shelf, and O is on a higher shelf than L. Finally, we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, this statement is enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.
 
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F is placed, since F can be on the same shelf as M and H or on a different shelf, so this statement is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, G, I, K, and L are placed, since they can be placed on any of the 2 remaining shelves, so this statement is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
  - Each shelf must have at least 2 books
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is on the middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M

Analysis:
  - If I is on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least 2 books (because more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf).
  - If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf, and F cannot be on the top shelf.
  - If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf, and L cannot be on the top shelf.
  - If F is on the same shelf as M, then either both are on the top shelf or both are on the bottom shelf.

Solution:
  - From the given conditions, we know that I is on the middle shelf. So, if we know which shelf F is on (because F is on the same shelf as M), then we can determine which shelf the other books are on. 
  - Therefore, the answer is (C) L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will each test one of four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) on the first day, and then a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H on one of the days.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - We are given that Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  - Based on the given conditions, we can deduce that:
    - Reynaldo can test either H or J on the first day.
    - Yuki can test either F or H on the first day.
    - Seamus must test J on the first day.
    - Theresa must test H on the first day.
  - Since Theresa tests G on the second day, we know that she cannot test H on the second day, which means H must be tested by Yuki or Reynaldo on the second day.
  - We know that Yuki cannot test H, so H must be tested by Reynaldo on the second day.
  - Therefore, Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - Yuki's first-day bicycle must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.

Solution:
  - Since Theresa tests G on the second day, Yuki's first-day bicycle must be H or J.
  - If Yuki tests H on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day. However, this is not possible since Yuki cannot test J.
  - Therefore, Yuki tests J on the first day, and Seamus tests H on the second day.
  - Since Theresa must test H, Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  - Thus, the only option that must be true is B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  - Each rider will test only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - Yuki tests a bicycle on the first day that Seamus tests on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day.
  - Reynaldo and Seamus cannot test the same bicycle on the same day.
  
  A: We don't know which bicycle Reynaldo tests on the first day. This choice is not necessarily true.
  B: Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, Reynaldo must test J on the first day. This choice is true.
  C: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day. This choice is not true.
  D: Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Theresa cannot test J on the first day. This choice is not true.
  E: Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, Yuki tests F on the first day, and Seamus tests F on the second day. This choice is not true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then:
- Yuki tests H on the first day (because Theresa must be one of the testers for H).
- Seamus tests J on the first day (because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day).
- Reynaldo tests F or H on the first day (because Reynaldo cannot test F and Theresa is testing G on the second day, which leaves only F and H for Reynaldo to test on the first day).

Therefore, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("B") Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  5. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  6. Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
If Theresa tests G on the second day, then on the first day, Seamus must test H, because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, Theresa must test H on the first day, because Theresa must be one of the testers for H. 

So, Reynaldo cannot test J on the first day, because Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, Reynaldo tests F on the first day. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Reynaldo cannot test F.
- Yuki cannot test J.
- Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
- The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
- Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then:
- Theresa cannot test G on the first day.
- Yuki must test G on the first day.
- Seamus must test H on the second day.
- Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki tests G, so Reynaldo must test J or H on the first day.

A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. Not necessarily true. Reynaldo could test J on the first day.
B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. Not necessarily true. Reynaldo could test H on the first day.
C: Theresa tests H on the second day. Not necessarily true. Theresa could test J on the first day.
D: Theresa tests J on the first day. Not necessarily true. Theresa tests H on the second day.
E: Yuki tests H on the second day. Must be true. If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Yuki must test G on the first day, which means Seamus must test H on the second day, leaving only H for Yuki to test on the second day.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. It is not possible because Reynaldo cannot test F, and if he does not test F, he must test J. Therefore, it is not possible for Reynaldo to test H.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. If Reynaldo tests J on the first day, then he cannot test F. Therefore, Reynaldo must test G or H on the first day. However, if Reynaldo tests G or H on the first day, then Yuki must test J on the first day, which is not possible. Therefore, Reynaldo must test J on the first day, and he will test F on the second day. 
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. It is not possible because Theresa must test H on the first day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. It is not possible because Reynaldo must test J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. If Yuki tests H on the second day, then Seamus must test H on the first day. Therefore, Yuki must test J on the first day, which is not possible. Therefore, Yuki cannot test H on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  - There are four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider tests one bicycle on the first day and a different bicycle on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H on one of the days.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - We are told that Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("D")

If Theresa is testing G on the second day, then she cannot test G on the first day. Therefore, Theresa must be testing H on the first day. Since Yuki cannot test J, and Seamus must test the same bike that Yuki tests on the first day, Yuki must be testing J on the first day and Seamus must be testing H on the first day. That means Reynaldo is testing F on the first day. Therefore, the only choice that must be true is D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  On the first day, each rider tests one of the bicycles F, G, H, and J.
  On the second day, each rider tests a different one of the bicycles F, G, H, and J.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Solution:
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then on the first day she must test either H or J.
  If Theresa tests H on the first day, then Yuki cannot test H on the second day (because Yuki cannot test J).
  Therefore, Yuki must test J on the second day, and Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day, which is not H.
  This means that Seamus must test F on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test H on the first day.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the first day.
  
Analysis: 
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day. 
  Since Theresa must be one of the testers for H, Theresa must test H on the first day, which means that Yuki must test J on the first day. 
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, which means that Seamus must test H on the second day. 
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test G on the first day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Solution:
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles, either QRS or RSQ. Since S must be earlier than Q, the only possible order is SQR. Then, G must be earlier than R, so the order must be SQRGJHY. However, we could also have H as the seventh article, and the order would be SQJRGYH. Therefore, we cannot fully determine the order if H is fourth or sixth, so we can eliminate choices A and B.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be finance articles, either GHJ or JHG. If we start with GHJ, then we must follow with QSYR and end with Y. If we start with JHG, then we must follow with QRSY and end with Y. Therefore, we can fully determine the order if R is fourth. 
  If R is seventh, then we must start with QSYHGRJ and end with Y, so we can fully determine the order. 
  If Y is fifth, then we must start with SQJRG and end with YH, but we cannot determine whether the nutrition or finance articles come first, so we can eliminate choice E.
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  - Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  - One article covers wildlife: Y.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - The order is subject to the following conditions:
    - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
    - S must be earlier than Y.
    - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
    
A: If H is fourth, we don't know which articles come before or after it. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
B: If H is sixth, we know that the articles edited before H must be G, R, Q, S, and Y (in that order). We also know that J must be edited before G, so the order is fully determined: J, G, R, Q, S, H, Y.
C: If R is fourth, we don't know which articles come before or after it. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
D: If R is seventh, we know that the articles edited before R must be J, G, Q, S, Y (in that order). We also know that G must be edited before R, so the order is fully determined: J, G, Q, S, Y, H, R.
E: If Y is fifth, we know that S must be first and Q must be third. However, we don't know the order of the other articles, so the order is not fully determined.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  G, H, and J cover finance.
  Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  Y covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Solution:
  If H is fourth, the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. However, we cannot determine the order of the remaining articles, G, H, J, and Y.
  If H is sixth, the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, and the fourth and fifth articles must be G and J in some order. However, we cannot determine the order of the last article, Y.
  If R is fourth, the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or J. If G is fourth, then H must be fifth, and J and Y must be sixth and seventh in some order. If J is fourth, then Y must be fifth, and G and H must be sixth and seventh in some order. Either way, the order is fully determined.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be S, Y, and either Q or R. If Q is fourth, then G and J must be fifth and sixth in some order, and H must be seventh. If R is fourth, then G and J must be fifth and sixth in some order, and H must be seventh. Either way, the order is fully determined.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, R, S, and G or J in some order. If G is fifth, then J must be sixth, and H and Y must be seventh in some order. If J is fifth, then G must be sixth, and H and Y must be seventh in some order. Either way, we cannot determine the order of the last two articles, H and Y.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - G, H, and J cover finance; Q, R, and S cover nutrition; and Y covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, then the order of the first four articles could be H, Q, R, and Y. However, we do not know the order of the remaining three articles, G, J, and S. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if H is fourth.
B: If H is sixth, then the order of the first five articles could be Q, R, S, G, and J. However, we do not know the order of the remaining two articles, H and Y. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if H is sixth.
C: If R is fourth, then the order of the first four articles must be Q, S, Y, and R. The order of the remaining three articles, G, H, and J, must be H, J, and G, in that order. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if R is fourth.
D: If R is seventh, then the order of the first six articles must be Q, S, Y, G, J, and H, in that order. However, we do not know the order of the seventh article, R. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if R is seventh.
E: If Y is fifth, then the order of the first five articles must be Q, S, Y, G, and J. The order of the remaining two articles, H and R, must be R and H, in that order. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if Y is fifth.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are seven articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three of the articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three other articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  The remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, but it is unknown which order they come in. The next article must be one of G or J, but it is unknown which one. The remaining articles are H and Y, but it is unknown which one comes first. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if H is fourth.
  If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be Q, R, S, G, and J, in that order. The last two articles are H and Y, but it is unknown which one comes first. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if H is sixth.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, in that order. The fourth article must be one of G or J, but it is unknown which one. The remaining articles are H and R, but it is unknown which one comes first. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if R is fourth.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, in that order. The fourth article must be G, and the fifth article must be J. The sixth article must be H. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if R is seventh.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, R, and G, in that order. The fifth article must be Y. The sixth article must be J, and the seventh article must be H. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if Y is fifth.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The articles are divided into two groups of three: finance (G, H, J) and nutrition (Q, R, S), and one article on wildlife (Y).
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third, which means that either QRS or RSQ are valid orderings.
  S must be earlier than Y, which means that if Y is not the last article, then the ordering must be QRSY or RSQY.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, which means that the ordering must be JGR or RGJ.
  
Analysis: 
  We can start by placing Y as the last article since it must be after S and there are no other articles to place after it. Therefore, we have the following orderings: 
  - QRSY
  - RSQY
  Next, we know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, we know that J must be first in the order and R must be last in the order. So we have the following orderings:
  - JGRSY
  - JRGSY
  - RSGQY
  - RQSJY
  Finally, we know that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, we cannot have consecutive finance or nutrition articles. This means that the only valid orderings are:
  - JGRSY
  - RSGQY
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles being edited is subject to certain conditions.
  Three of the articles cover finance, three cover nutrition, and one covers wildlife.
  The order of the articles is not fully determined until a specific condition is met.
  
A: If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles Q, R, and S. The next article must be G, followed by J, then H, and finally Y. However, the order of article S and Q is not determined, so the order is not fully determined.
B: If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles Q, R, and S. The fourth article must be Y, followed by G, J, and finally H. However, the order of article S and Q is not determined, so the order is not fully determined.
C: If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be finance articles G, H, and J. The fourth article must be Y, followed by nutrition articles Q, S, and finally R. However, the order of article S and Q is not determined, so the order is not fully determined.
D: If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be finance articles G, H, and J. The fourth article must be Y, followed by nutrition articles Q, S, and finally R. The order is fully determined.
E: If Y is fifth, then the first article must be a nutrition article, either Q or S. The second article must be finance article G, followed by finance article J, then nutrition article R, and finally nutrition article H. However, the order of article S and Q is not determined, so the order is not fully determined.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are seven articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: H is fourth.
If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, in that order. S must be earlier than Y, so Y must be fifth. The order of the remaining two articles, G and J, is not determined. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if H is fourth.

B: H is sixth.
If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be Q, R, S, Y, and G, in that order. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, so J and R must be the last two articles, in either order. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if H is sixth.

C: R is fourth.
If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, in that order. S must be earlier than Q, so Q cannot be third. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if R is fourth.

D: R is seventh.
If R is seventh, then the first four articles must be Q, S, Y, and G, in that order. J must be earlier than G, so J must be fifth and H must be sixth. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if R is seventh.

E: Y is fifth.
If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, R, and G, in that order. J must be earlier than G, so J must be sixth and H must be seventh. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if Y is fifth.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  3 articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  3 articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  1 article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Let's evaluate each option:
  A: H is fourth. 
    This option does not provide enough information to determine the order of the articles. 
  B: H is sixth. 
    This option does not provide enough information to determine the order of the articles.
  C: R is fourth. 
    This option does not provide enough information to determine the order of the articles.
  D: R is seventh. 
    This option does not provide enough information to determine the order of the articles.
  E: Y is fifth. 
    If Y is fifth, then S must be earlier than Q (because S must be earlier than Y). Since Q cannot be fourth, it must be sixth. Therefore, R must be seventh. 
    The order of the articles would be: G, S, J, H, Y, Q, R.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  G, H, J cover finance; Q, R, S cover nutrition; and Y covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If H is fourth, we do not know the positions of G and J, nor the positions of the nutrition articles, nor the position of Y. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  If H is sixth, we do not know the positions of G and J, nor the position of Y. We only know that the nutrition articles must be in positions 4, 5, and 7, in some order. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  If R is fourth, we know that G and J must be in positions 2 and 3, in some order; we know that the nutrition articles must be in positions 5, 6, and 7, in some order; and we know that Y must be in position 7. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
  If R is seventh, we know that Y must be in position 6, and we know that the nutrition articles must be in positions 1, 2, and 4, in some order. We do not know the positions of G and J, nor the position of H. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  If Y is fifth, we know that S must be in position 1, and we know that the nutrition articles must be in positions 2, 3, and 4, in some order. We do not know the positions of G, H, J, or R. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf must have more books than the top shelf. Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books. Since there are 8 books in total, at least 3 books must be placed on the middle shelf.
  
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf and F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, if G is placed on the top shelf, then the only possible configuration for the books on the middle shelf is I, L and one more book, either H or K. This is because K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf if F is on the same shelf as M. O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the middle shelf if L is on the middle shelf.
  
  A: H, I - This cannot be correct because there must be at least 3 books on the middle shelf.
  B: I, L - This could be correct if the third book on the middle shelf is K or H.
  C: H, I, L - This could be correct if the third book on the middle shelf is K.
  D: I, K, L - This cannot be correct because F and M must be on the same shelf, and K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  E: F, I, M - This cannot be correct because there must be at least 3 books on the middle shelf.
  
  Therefore, the answer is B: I, L.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are eight books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least three books, and the middle shelf must have at least two books. Since I is on the middle shelf, the remaining book on the middle shelf must be either H or L. If K is on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M, then K and M must be on the bottom shelf, and F must be on the middle shelf with I and either H or L.
  
  A: H, I - H cannot be on the middle shelf because it would leave L and O on the same shelf, which is not allowed. 
  B: I, L - L cannot be on the middle shelf because it would leave H and O on the same shelf, which is not allowed.
  C: H, I, L - This is not possible because O must be on a higher shelf than L.
  D: I, K, L - This is not possible because K and M must be on the same shelf.
  E: F, I, M - This is possible because F, I, and either H or L are on the middle shelf, and K, M, and two other books are on the bottom shelf. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then at most one book can be placed on the top shelf. 
  Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, at least four books must be placed on the bottom shelf. 
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so the remaining books must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is not on the middle shelf, then M must be on the top shelf and F must be on the bottom shelf. 
  If M is on the top shelf, then O must be on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then K must be on the middle shelf.
  
  Therefore, the only possible complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is I and K.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
If G is placed on the top shelf, then we know that:
  - The top shelf has at least 2 books (because at least 2 books are placed on each shelf).
  - The bottom shelf has more than 2 books (because more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf).
  - G is not placed on the middle or bottom shelf (because it is placed on the top shelf).
  - I is placed on the middle shelf (given).
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F (given).
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L (given).
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M (given).

We can deduce the following:
  - Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F and F is not on the top shelf, then K and F must be on the middle and bottom shelves (in some order).
  - Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L and there are only three shelves, then O and L must be on different shelves (one is on the middle shelf and the other is on the bottom shelf).
  - Since I is placed on the middle shelf and G is on the top shelf, then the remaining books (H and M) must be on the bottom shelf along with at least one other book.

Option A: H, I
  - If H and I are on the middle shelf, then the bottom shelf must have F, M, and at least one other book.
  - However, we know that the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf, so this option is not possible.

Option B: I, L
  - If I is on the middle shelf and L is on the bottom shelf, then the remaining books (F, G, H, K, M, and O) must be on the top shelf and the middle shelf.
  - However, we know that the top shelf has at least 2 books and the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf, so this option is not possible.

Option C: H, I, L
  - If H, I, and L are on the middle and bottom shelves, then the remaining books (F, G, K, M, and O) must be on the top shelf and the middle shelf.
  - This option is possible, so we will keep it as a potential answer.

Option D: I, K, L
  - If I is on the middle shelf and K and L are on the bottom shelf, then the remaining books (F, G, H, M, and O) must be on the top shelf and the middle shelf.
  - However, we know that the top shelf has at least 2 books and the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf, so this option is not possible.

Option E: F, I, M
  - If F, I, and M are on the middle and bottom shelves, then the remaining books (G, H, K, L, and O) must be on the top shelf and the middle shelf.
  - However, we know that the top shelf has at least 2 books and the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf, so this option is not possible.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there are at least 4 books on the bottom shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then there are at least 2 books on the middle shelf.
  
  If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then F and M must both be on the top shelf, the middle shelf, or the bottom shelf. If F and M are on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf, which is not possible since G is also on the top shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf or the bottom shelf.
  
  If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F and M are on the same shelf, then K and M must be on the same shelf as well. Therefore, K and M are either both on the middle shelf or both on the bottom shelf.
  
  If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and there are at least 4 books on the bottom shelf, then O and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  
  Based on the above analysis, the only possible complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I and L.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 8 books placed on exactly 3 shelves, and at least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then it cannot be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  
Analysis:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at least 2 books on the top shelf, and at most 2 books on the middle and bottom shelves combined. 
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so there is exactly 1 book on the middle shelf. 
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is not on the middle shelf, then M is not on the middle shelf either.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf if F is not.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so if O is not on the middle shelf, then L is not on the middle shelf either.
  
Solution:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the books on the middle shelf must be I and one other book. 
  If F is on the middle shelf, then M cannot be on the middle shelf. 
  If K is not on the middle shelf, then it must be on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If O is not on the middle shelf, then L cannot be on the middle shelf, which violates the condition that at least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible list of books placed on the middle shelf is H and I.
Action: Answer("A")

  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then at least 2 books are placed on the top shelf. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, then 3 or more books must be placed on the bottom shelf. Thus, there are exactly 3 books placed on the middle shelf: F, I, and M. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then F and M must also be placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, the complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is {F, I, M}.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf, and at least 2 books on the bottom shelf.
  - Since I is on the middle shelf, H cannot be on the top shelf.
  - Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the top shelf if F is on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the top shelf if L is on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - If F is on the top shelf, then M must be on the top shelf as well, which means there are at least 3 books on the top shelf.
  - Therefore, F and M cannot be on the top shelf.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are eight books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
If G is placed on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least three books (more than the top shelf). Also, K and O cannot be on the top shelf because they are placed on a higher shelf than F and L, respectively. Therefore, K and O must be on the bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be on the middle shelf. Finally, I is placed on the middle shelf, so the only book left to place on the middle shelf is H.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F and M must be on the same shelf, and they cannot be on the top shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom or middle shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, F and M cannot be on the middle shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, only two books can be on the top shelf, and those books are G and either H or L. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf, so K must be on the middle shelf. Finally, O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the harmonica must have been auctioned before the table.
  - It is not clear whether the table is auctioned before or after the lamp, so option B cannot be determined.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so option C cannot be true.
  - The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, so option D cannot be true.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, but we don't know the order of the harmonica and the lamp, so option E cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: 
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the table. This is because the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the vase must be auctioned on an earlier date than the table. And since the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase, the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  - Thus, the answer is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table. 
  - B, C, D, and E are not true based on the given information.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  3. The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  4. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  5. We know that the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase.
  
Analysis:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and D since they both suggest that the table is auctioned before one of these items. Option B is also incorrect because we do not know whether the table is auctioned before or after the lamp. Option C is possible since we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and it is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Option E is not possible because we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and we also know that the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica is auctioned before the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, it means that the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. 
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then:
  - The harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, and the harmonica is not auctioned after the lamp.
  - The table is not auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp because the lamp is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  - The table is not auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase because the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp because the lamp is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. Therefore, the only possible answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. Thus, the table can only be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. 
  A: The harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th if the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase, so this is not possible.
  B: The table cannot be auctioned earlier than the lamp, so this is not possible.
  C: The table cannot be auctioned earlier than the sundial, so this is not possible.
  D: This could be true, as we don't know the order of the mirror and the vase.
  E: The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th if the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase, so this is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  3. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  4. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  5. The table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
Action: 
  From condition 5, we know that the table is auctioned on June 4th, June 5th or June 6th.
  From condition 3, we know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, which means the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  From condition 4, we know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the harmonica or the vase must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 6th, then the table must be auctioned on June 4th, which contradicts condition 5. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 6th, and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 5th.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, which contradicts condition 2. Therefore, the vase must be auctioned on June 5th, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 4th.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st, which contradicts condition 2. Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  So, the possible order of the auctions is: 
  June 1st: Lamp
  June 2nd: Mirror
  June 3rd: Vase
  June 4th: Table
  June 5th: Sundial
  June 6th: Harmonica
  From the possible order, we can see that choice D is true. Therefore, Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.

Solution:
  We know that the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  A: The harmonica is auctioned before the table. This could be true.
  B: The table is auctioned before the lamp. This is not possible because we know that the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, and the lamp could be auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  C: The table is auctioned before the sundial. This is not possible because we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase.
  D: The mirror is auctioned before the vase. This is not possible because we know that the vase is auctioned after the mirror.
  E: The sundial is auctioned before the lamp. This is not possible because we know that the sundial is auctioned after the mirror and the vase.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table, because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, and if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table, then the table would be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase and the condition would be violated.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp if the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  - The table is auctioned later than the mirror and the vase.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If the table is auctioned later than both the mirror and the vase, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table, as the table is already later than the mirror and the vase, and the harmonica cannot be later than the table. Option A is eliminated. If the table is later than the mirror, then the table cannot be earlier than the lamp, as the lamp must be later than the mirror. Option B is eliminated. The sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table, as the table must be earlier than the harmonica or the vase, and the sundial is already later than both the mirror and the vase. Option C is eliminated. Therefore, option D, "The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase," could be true, as it does not contradict any of the given conditions. Option E is also eliminated, as it is not relevant to the question asked.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
Action: 
  - If the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase, then we know that the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. 
  - The harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 6th because that would mean the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, which is not allowed. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the table cannot be auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned because the table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which is not allowed. Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, which is not allowed. Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 3rd.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, then the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, which is allowed. Therefore, the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 4th because the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the mirror is auctioned on June 4th and the lamp is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. However, the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, which means the vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. Therefore, the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd and the vase is auctioned on June 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then it must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not allowed. Therefore, the table is auctioned on June 3rd, which means the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, the mirror is auctioned on June 4th, the lamp is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, and the vase is auctioned on June 6th.
  - The only statement that could be true is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 spaces in a row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it cannot be in space 5, which means it must be in space 1 or space 7.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7, and the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, which means the toy store cannot be in space 3. Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 3, and the shoe store must be in space 4. This leaves space 6 for the other restaurant, which satisfies the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. So, this arrangement is possible.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the restaurant must be in space 1, and the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, which means the toy store cannot be in space 4. Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 2, and the shoe store must be in space 3. This leaves space 4 for the other restaurant, which violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. So, this arrangement is not possible.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row in the shopping center.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.

  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
Action: Answer("B") 
If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it must be in space 1 or space 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, making choice B the correct answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
  
Process of elimination:
  - A cannot be true because if the optometrist is in space 2, then the pharmacy cannot be next to it or the veterinarian.
  - B cannot be true because if the pharmacy is in space 7, then it cannot be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - C can be true because if a restaurant is in space 4, then the other restaurant can be in space 1 or space 7, and the pharmacy can be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, which satisfies all the constraints.
  - D cannot be true because if the shoe store is in space 6, then the toy store must be in space 4 or space 7, and the restaurant cannot be at the other end of the row.
  - E cannot be true because if the toy store is in space 3, then the veterinarian must be in space 4 or space 6, which violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Reasoning:
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 4 or space 6.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Since one of the restaurants must be at the other end and the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or space 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 4.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, a restaurant cannot be in space 4 or space 6.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 4 or space 6.
  - Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 2 and a restaurant must be in space 4 or space 6.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven spaces in a straight row numbered 1 through 7.
  Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, it means that there are two businesses on each side of the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in space 4 or space 6.
  If the pharmacy is in space 4, then the optometrist must be in space 3 and the two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7, respectively. This means that the shoe store and the toy store must be in spaces 2 and 6, respectively. But this violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 6. This means that the optometrist must be in space 7 and one of the restaurants must be in space 1. The other restaurant must be in either space 2 or space 4. Therefore, the shoe store must be in space 3 and the toy store must be in space 2 or space 4.

  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 4 or 6.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 1 and 2 or in spaces 6 and 7.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 6 and one of the restaurants must be in space 1.
  Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it must be in space 3.
  Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 2 and the shoe store in space 7.

  Since the veterinarian is in space 5, we know that the pharmacy must be either in space 6 or space 1. If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the optometrist must be in space 2. This means that the shoe store must be in space 3, and the toy store must be in space 4. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, a restaurant cannot be in space 4. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that the pharmacy is in space 7.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
  
  A: There is no information about the location of the optometrist. We cannot determine whether the optometrist is in space 2 or not.
  B: The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in either space 4 or space 6. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 7. 
  C: The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since the pharmacy is at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, there are only two possible arrangements: R _ _ P _ _ V or V _ _ P _ _ R. In both cases, there is no restaurant in space 4.
  D: There is no information about the location of the shoe store. We cannot determine whether the shoe store is in space 6 or not.
  E: The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the toy store must be in either space 3 or space 7. Therefore, the toy store can be in space 3.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The veterinarian is in space 5.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Analysis: 
  Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be either in space 6 or space 4. If the pharmacy is in space 6, then the restaurant must be in space 1, which contradicts the constraint that the restaurant must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 4. This means that the restaurant must be in space 7. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the only possible location for the other restaurant is space 2. Therefore, the optometrist cannot be in space 2. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it cannot be in space 4 or space 6. Therefore, the shoe store must be in space 6 and the toy store must be in space 3.

  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

A: Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, but it is not stated that forest cannot be used in a multicolored rug. Therefore, A is not necessarily true.
B: This statement is true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
C: Peach is used in every rug that olive is used in, so if olive is used in any of the rugs, then peach must also be used in one of the rugs. Therefore, C is true.
D: Turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug. Therefore, D is not necessarily true.
E: There are only five colors available, and we know that peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, if peach is used in one of the rugs, then yellow must be used in one of the other rugs. Therefore, E is true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread.
  - Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  - Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.

  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
  - From the given rules, we can conclude that Peach is used in one of the rugs because Olive is used in one of the rugs and Peach must be used in that rug. 
  - We cannot conclude that A, B, D, or E must be true based on the given rules.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are six colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  - Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the three rugs.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  - Let's start with options A and B. There is no rule that prohibits the use of forest or turquoise in multicolored rugs. Therefore, options A and B can be eliminated.
  - Now, let's move to option C. According to the second rule, if olive is used, peach must also be used. Since olive is not used in all three rugs, peach must be used in one of the rugs. Therefore, option C must be true.
  - Next, let's consider option D. According to the rules, turquoise cannot be used with forest or peach. Therefore, it is possible that turquoise is not used in any of the rugs. Hence, option D is not necessarily true.
  - Finally, let's look at option E. According to the rules, peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, it is possible that yellow is not used in any of the rugs. Hence, option E is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("C")

  - If olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  - If A is true, then forest is not used in any of the rugs. This is possible, but not necessarily true.
  - If B is true, then turquoise is not used in any of the multicolored rugs. However, it could still be used in a solid-colored rug. Thus, B is not necessarily true.
  - If C is true, then peach is used in at least one of the rugs. This is possible, as olive requires the use of peach, and white requires the use of two other colors, one of which could be peach. Thus, C is a possible answer.
  - If D is true, then turquoise is used in at least one of the rugs. This is possible, as turquoise could be used in a solid-colored rug, or in a multicolored rug that does not contain peach. Thus, D is a possible answer.
  - If E is true, then yellow is used in at least one of the rugs. This is possible, as yellow could be used in a solid-colored rug, or in a multicolored rug that does not contain peach. Thus, E is a possible answer.

  - According to the constraints, Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture and the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, Jiang cannot give the watercolors lecture. This cannot be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

A: If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must be earlier. This is possible, so A can be true.
B: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden must give either the oil paintings or the watercolors lecture. This is possible, so B can be true.
C: If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden must give the oil paintings lecture and Farley must give the lithographs lecture. This is possible, so C can be true.
D: If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley must give the first lecture, which cannot be on oil paintings, so D cannot be true.
E: If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden must give the oil paintings lecture and Farley must give the lithographs lecture. This is possible, so E can be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures, each on a different topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  - Constraints:
    - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Action: 
  - If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings and watercolors lectures would both have to be earlier than the lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  - If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture would have to be earlier than the sculptures lecture, which violates the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  - If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture would have to be earlier than the watercolors lecture, which satisfies all of the constraints. Therefore, C can be true.
  - If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture would have to be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which violates the constraint that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  - If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture would have to be earlier than the watercolors lecture, which satisfies all of the constraints. Therefore, E can be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The novel has seven chapters and each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then:
  - S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - If S is not mentioned in chapter 6, then it must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5.
  - If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, because S and R cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - If S is mentioned in chapter 5, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, because S and R cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, and so it cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 either, because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7, and R must be mentioned in chapter 2, because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and S cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters with R.
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 5, W must be mentioned in chapter 7, and R must be mentioned in chapter 2, because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and S cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters with R.
  
  Based on the above analysis:
  - A cannot be true, because R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 if S is mentioned in chapter 3.
  - B can be true, because S can be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5.
  - C cannot be true, because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - D cannot be true, because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - E can be true, if U is mentioned in chapter 4, X is mentioned in chapter 5, and W is mentioned in chapter 7.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The mystery novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.

  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then it cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  
Analysis:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, S can only be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then they can only be mentioned in chapters 1 and 2, or chapters 2 and 3, or chapters 3 and 4, or chapters 4 and 5, or chapters 5 and 6.
  If T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T can only be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  If W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then W can only be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 2, and X is mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3 or chapter 4 or chapter 5, then Z can only be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S and T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues to be mentioned in seven chapters.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
  
  A: There are only two chapters between the mention of T and W, so T cannot be in chapter 3, which is too close to W if Z is in chapter 7.
  B: There are only two chapters between the mention of T and W, so T cannot be in chapter 3, which is too close to W if Z is in chapter 7.
  C: T cannot be in chapter 4 because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  D: U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and U must be mentioned in adjacent chapters with X.
  E: If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, and T must be mentioned in chapter 2. This satisfies all of the constraints.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find a valid order of clues given the constraints.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
  
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, W must be mentioned in chapter 5. Then, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 6. So, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4. If T is mentioned in chapter 4, W must be mentioned in chapter 7. If T is mentioned in chapter 3, W must be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, the order of clues is one of the following:
  1) T, R, X, U, S, W, Z
  2) R, T, X, U, S, W, Z
  3) R, X, U, T, S, W, Z
  4) R, X, U, S, T, W, Z
  5) R, X, U, S, W, T, Z
  
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. This is possible only in order 2. 
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3. This is possible only in order 1, 2, and 4.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4. This is possible only in order 2 and 4.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1. This is not possible since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5. This is possible only in order 1 and 5.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each chapter must contain exactly one clue.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Explanation: 
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in one of the first five chapters. If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4 (since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters), and T must be mentioned in chapter 2 (since T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W). Then, R must be mentioned in chapter 3, leaving only W to be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, X could be mentioned in chapter 5, which is answer choice E.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each chapter mentions one clue, and each clue is mentioned exactly once.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - If S is not mentioned in chapter 6, then it must be mentioned in either chapter 3 or chapter 5.
  - If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 4, and T must be mentioned in chapter 2. However, this violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - If S is mentioned in chapter 5, then R must be mentioned in chapter 3, and T must be mentioned in chapter 4. This satisfies all the constraints.
  - Therefore, the answer is (B) S is mentioned in chapter 3.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
- Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
- T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- Z is mentioned in chapter 7.

Analysis:
- Since Z is mentioned in chapter 7, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
- Also, since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
- If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then the only possible clue that can be mentioned in chapter 2 is U, which means that X must be mentioned in chapter 4, violating the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then the only possible clue that can be mentioned in chapter 2 is U, which means that X must be mentioned in chapter 4, violating the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then the only possible clue that can be mentioned in chapter 2 is U, which means that X must be mentioned in chapter 3 and W must be mentioned in chapter 6, satisfying all the constraints.
- If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then the only possible clue that can be mentioned in chapter 6 is U, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 4 and T must be mentioned in chapter 2, violating the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z are seven different clues that are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints:
    - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.

  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then clues R, S, T, U, W, and X must be mentioned in chapters 1 through 6, but their order is not yet determined.
  
Analysis:
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then clues R, S, T, U, W, and X must be mentioned in chapters 1 through 6, but their order is not yet determined.
  - We know that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapters 2 through 6.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 3, or 5.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, U must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 5.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, and clues R, S, T, U, W, and X are mentioned in chapters 1 through 6 in the following order: S, T, R, U, X, W, then X must be mentioned in chapter 5. Therefore, E is the correct answer.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned once and only once.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, with two chapters separating their mentions.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then:
  - W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6, since T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - X must be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7, since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 6, since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  A: There is no information about the placement of R, so this could be true.
  B: There is no information about the placement of S, so this could be true.
  C: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so this is not true.
  D: U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so this is not true.
  E: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then X must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 7, which satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, this could be true.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The mystery novel consists of seven chapters.
  Seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  
Analysis:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, S can only be mentioned in chapters 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which is not possible since Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not possible since W must be mentioned after T and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4 and W must be mentioned in chapter 7. This satisfies all the constraints.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The project has four years and four students, with one student assigned to each year.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned.
  If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Applying the last two conditions, if Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Thus, Ryan must be assigned to either 1922 or 1923, and Onyx must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx must all be assigned to the project. Since there are only six students available, this means that everyone must be assigned to the project. Therefore, (A) Louis is not assigned to the project, (B) Ryan is not assigned to the project, (C) Tiffany is not assigned to the project, (D) Onyx is assigned to 1922, and (E) Louis is assigned to 1924 cannot be true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project.
  A: We cannot assign Louis to 1923, and Tiffany can only be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to a year other than 1923. This choice is not possible.
  B: If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  C: If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, which violates the condition that if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  D: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. Mollie must then be assigned to 1921. This is a possible assignment of students to years, so this choice could be true.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to 1922. Mollie must then be assigned to 1921. This is a possible assignment of students to years, so this choice could be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We know that there are four years, and four students will be assigned to them, one per year. 
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. 
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the four students who will be assigned to the project are Louis, Mollie, Onyx, and Ryan, and the following conditions apply:
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. 
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
  Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it could be true that Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  There are six students available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Solution:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to one of the years 1921, 1922, or 1924. If Tiffany is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which is a contradiction because there is no year immediately prior to 1924. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922, which means that Louis must be assigned to 1923, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to 1922, which means that Mollie must be assigned to 1921. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to 1921, which is a contradiction because Mollie is already assigned to 1921. Therefore, Ryan cannot be assigned to the project. If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Louis must be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, which is a contradiction because there is no year immediately prior to 1924. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1921 and Louis must be assigned to 1923. This leaves Ryan to be assigned to 1924. 
  Thus, the only option that could be true is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The project requires assigning students to four different years (1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924).
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be five students available for the project.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then five students (Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany) will be assigned to the four years. 
  Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so one of them must be assigned to that year. 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. 
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. 
  Therefore, the possible assignments are:
    - Louis to 1923, Mollie to 1921 or 1922, Onyx to 1922 or 1924, Ryan to 1924 or with Tiffany to 1923.
    - Tiffany to 1923 with Louis not assigned, Mollie to 1921 or 1922, Onyx to 1922 or 1924, Ryan to 1924.
    - Ryan to 1924 with Tiffany assigned, Louis to 1923, Mollie to 1921 or 1922, Onyx to 1922.
    - Onyx to 1922 with Ryan assigned to 1924, Tiffany assigned to 1923, Louis to 1921 or 1924, Mollie to the remaining year (1921 or 1922).
    - Onyx to 1924 with Ryan assigned to 1923, Tiffany not assigned, Louis to 1923, Mollie to 1921 or 1922.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Six students are available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: Answer("A")
If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it is still possible for Louis to be unassigned to the project. The conditions only limit the assignments of Louis and Tiffany to 1923, and Ryan to the year immediately after Onyx. Therefore, it is possible that Louis is not assigned to the project. The other choices are not possible:
  B: Ryan must be assigned to the project if Tiffany is assigned, so Ryan cannot be unassigned if Yoshio is not assigned.
  C: If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned, which violates the condition that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be unassigned.
  D: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, which means Tiffany must be assigned to the project. This violates the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which means Ryan must be assigned to the project. This violates the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1924.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project. We need to determine which of the answer choices could still be true given this constraint.

  A: It is possible that Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: It is possible that Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: It is possible that Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: It is possible that Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: It is not possible that Louis is assigned to 1924, because each year can only have one student assigned to it, and if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available, so one of the years will not have a student assigned to it.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are four years in the project: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  There are six students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Action: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the remaining five students must be assigned to the four years. 
  The following scenarios are possible:
  1. Louis is assigned to 1923, and Tiffany is assigned to the project with Ryan. In this case, Mollie and Onyx must be assigned to 1921 and 1922, respectively.
  2. Tiffany is not assigned to the project. In this case, Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, and Onyx cannot be assigned to any year. Louis, Mollie, and Yoshio must be assigned to 1921, 1922, and 1924, respectively.
  3. Louis is not assigned to the project. In this case, Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 with Ryan. Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to the remaining year.
  4. Louis is assigned to 1923, and Tiffany is not assigned to the project. In this case, Mollie, Ryan, and Yoshio must be assigned to 1921, 1922, and 1924, respectively. Onyx cannot be assigned to any year.
  5. Louis is not assigned to 1923, and Tiffany is assigned to the project with Ryan. In this case, Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to the remaining year. Yoshio cannot be assigned to any year.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
  A: We don't know if Louis is assigned to the project or not.
  B: We don't know if Ryan is assigned to the project or not.
  C: We don't know if Tiffany is assigned to the project or not.
  D: We don't know if Onyx is assigned to 1922 or not.
  E: Louis cannot be assigned to 1924 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923 and Yoshio is not assigned to the project. So, Louis must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  2. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  3. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  4. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  5. Four students will be assigned to the project, one for each year from 1921 to 1924.
  
  The question asks which one of the options could be true, so we need to check if each option is possible or not.

Analysis:
  We know that there are four years and four students who will be assigned to this project. If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the remaining five students will be assigned to the project. Let's evaluate each option:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then only Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. But this would mean that Ryan must be assigned to the project, which would leave only two students (Mollie and Onyx) to be assigned to 1921 and 1922. This is not possible since Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. This is because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, option B is possible.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. This would mean that Ryan must be assigned to the project, which would leave only two students (Mollie and Onyx) to be assigned to 1921 and 1922. This is not possible since Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, option C is not possible.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922 - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923. This would mean that only Tiffany and Louis are left to be assigned to the project. But we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, option D is not possible.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924 - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then only Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. This would mean that Ryan must be assigned to the project, which would leave only two students (Mollie and Onyx) to be assigned to 1921 and 1922. This is not possible since Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, option E is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. M is published in the fall.
  2. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  3. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  4. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  5. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  From rule 5, if M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall.
  From rule 3, K and N must be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, K also cannot be published in the fall.
  From rule 4, if K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. But since K cannot be published in the fall, we don't need to consider this rule.
  From rule 2, M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall.
  From the above analysis, the only cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M are L and O.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- M is published in the fall
- K and N must be published in the same season as each other
- If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall
- If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
- M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other
- There are two seasons: fall and spring

Analysis:
- If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and N must be published in the spring as well.
- If K and N are published in the spring, O must be published in the spring too.
- Therefore, K, N, and O must be published in the spring.
- M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other, so P must be published in the spring.
- That leaves L and 0 to be published in the fall, along with M.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - M is published in the fall.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  - K and N must be published in the same season.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  - Since M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  - Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall.
  - Since K and N must be published in the same season, N must be published in the fall.
  - Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring (according to rule 4). Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall (according to rule 3). Thus, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
- K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
- If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
- If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring

Action: 
If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be one of the cookbooks published in the fall along with M. 
If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, K and O must both be published in the fall. 
So, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  2. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  3. K and N must be published in the same season.
  4. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, M cannot be published with N in the fall. 
  K and N must be published in the same season. Therefore, if K and N are published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. 
  M and P cannot be published in the same season. Therefore, if M is published in the fall, P must be published in the spring.
  The only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring (from 4 above). Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall (from 3 above). Therefore, K and O cannot be published in the fall since N cannot be published in the fall (as already established). If L is published in the fall, it can be published with M in the fall. Therefore, the answer is L and O.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall. This eliminates choices B and D. 
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, if N cannot be published in the fall, K cannot be published in the fall either. This eliminates choice A. 
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. But if M is published in the fall, then K cannot be published in the fall. Therefore, O cannot be published in the fall. This eliminates choice C. 
  Therefore, the only possible choice is E: 0 and P.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- M is published in the fall.
- M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
- If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
- K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
- If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.

Analysis:
- If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be paired with M.
- K and N must be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, if N is published in the spring, K must also be published in the spring. But if K is published in the spring, O cannot be published in the fall (contradicts the last condition).
- If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, if K is published in the fall, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with K and O is (K, O).
- P cannot be published in the fall if M is published in the fall. Therefore, P cannot be paired with M.
- That leaves us with two cookbooks that could be paired with M in the fall: L and 0.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. M cannot be published in the same season as P.
  2. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  3. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  4. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  
Analysis: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. That means L and P must also be published in the fall. So, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.

  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then there are three possible scenarios for the first three compositions performed:
   1. O is performed first and P is performed second, then T must be performed third, and since S is performed fourth, then F and R must be performed fifth and sixth, respectively, and the last two compositions performed are either L or H and then the remaining one. So, the answer is D.
   2. P is performed first and either O or T is performed second, then the other one is performed third, and since S is performed fourth, then F and R must be performed fifth and sixth, respectively, and the last two compositions performed are either L or H and then the remaining one. So, this scenario is not listed as an option.
   3. T is performed first and either O or P is performed second, then the other one is performed third, and since S is performed fourth, then F and R must be performed fifth and sixth, respectively, and the last two compositions performed are either L or H and then the remaining one. So, this scenario is not listed as an option.

Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles

  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Bay 4 must hold one of the following three types of cargo: fuel, produce, or textiles.
  Livestock must be in one of the two highest-numbered bays (5 or 6), so it cannot be in bay 4. Therefore, livestock cannot be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six bays numbered from 1 to 6.
  - There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  - Grain is held in a higher-numbered bay than the bay holding livestock.
  - Livestock is held in a higher-numbered bay than the bay holding textiles.
  - Produce is held in a higher-numbered bay than the bay holding fuel.
  - Textiles is held in a bay next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  - According to the given information, bay 6 must hold grain, bay 5 must hold livestock, and bay 2 must hold textiles.
  - Bay 3 must hold produce, and bay 4 must hold either fuel or machinery.
  - Therefore, the type of cargo that CANNOT be held in bay 4 is either produce or textiles.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo, bay 2 holds a different one of the six types, and so on up to bay 6.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  From the rule "The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel", we know that fuel cannot be held in bay 6.
  From the rule "The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce", we know that textiles cannot be held in bay 1 or bay 6.
  From the rule "The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles", we know that livestock cannot be held in bay 1, 2, or 3.
  From the rule "The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock", we know that grain cannot be held in bay 1, 2, 3, or 4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.

Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")  
If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on another wall. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's watercolor is displayed. Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of the same wall (since each wall has exactly one oil and one watercolor). This means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Isaacs's oil is displayed, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of that same wall. So, Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. Therefore, the answer is C.

  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Analysis: 
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, it means that Greene's watercolor is displayed on a different wall from Franz's oil. 
  - Since each wall has exactly two paintings, it means that Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's paintings.
  - We need to find out what must be true based on this information.
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. - We cannot determine this based on the given information. Incorrect.

Explanation: 
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then it means that the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed will have Greene's watercolor in the upper position. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. This means that Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on the same wall, and since no wall can have only watercolors, it means that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. Thus, the only option that must be true is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, which is option C.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are four walls and each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than Franz's oil.
  
Analysis:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than Franz's oil. So, either Greene's oil or Franz's watercolor will be displayed on a wall with paintings of other students. Therefore, Hidalgo's paintings (both oil and watercolor) must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil or Franz's watercolor.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will display exactly two paintings - an oil and a watercolor.
  - Two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls (1, 2, 3, and 4) with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - We need to determine what must be true if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor.
  
Analysis:
  - If Greene's watercolor is displayed on the wall with Franz's oil, then Greene's oil must be displayed on one of the other two walls (not on wall 1 or 4).
  - This means that Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 1 and 4.
  - Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, then Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  - This leaves Hidalgo's oil to be displayed in the upper position of wall 1.
  - Therefore, the correct answer must be one that is consistent with the above analysis.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students displaying two paintings each.
  2. Two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room.
  3. One painting will be in the upper position, and the other will be in the lower position.
  4. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  5. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  6. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  7. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  8. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, this means that Franz's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. Therefore, neither of the paintings displayed on that wall can be Hidalgo's, as no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. This means that Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on a different wall, and since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four walls has one upper and one lower position.
  - Each student displays two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that:
- Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor are displayed on the same wall (Wall 1, 2, or 3).
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position on Wall 4, so Isaacs cannot have a painting on the same wall as Franz's oil or Greene's watercolor.

Therefore, the only student left who could have a painting on the same wall as Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor is Hidalgo. 
- Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor (as that would result in a wall with only watercolors).
- Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor (Wall 2 or 3), and since Greene's watercolor is in the upper position on that wall, Hidalgo's oil must be in the upper position. 

Thus, the answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students displaying two paintings each, an oil and a watercolor, on the four walls of an exhibition room.
  - Each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
- Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than Franz's oil (to satisfy the condition "No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it").
- Greene's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor in the lower position (since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the same wall as Franz's oil).
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor (to satisfy the condition "No wall has only watercolors displayed on it").
- Hidalgo's two paintings must be displayed on the same wall, and since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, Hidalgo's two paintings must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor and Franz's oil.
- Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position, satisfying the condition "No wall has only watercolors displayed on it".

Thus, the answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four students has one oil and one watercolor painting.
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

To determine which one of the following must be true if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, we need to use the given information to make deductions.

We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that:
- Franz's watercolor is displayed in the lower position of the same wall.
- Greene's oil is displayed in the lower position of the same wall.

Now we need to check each of the answer choices to see which one must be true based on this deduction.

A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
- This is not necessarily true. We know that Greene's oil is displayed in the lower position of the same wall as Franz's watercolor.

B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
- This is not necessarily true. We do not have enough information to determine the positions or walls of Hidalgo's paintings.

C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
- This is not necessarily true. We do not have enough information to determine the positions or walls of Hidalgo's paintings.

D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
- This is not necessarily true. We do not have enough information to determine the positions or walls of Hidalgo's paintings.

E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
- This must be true. We know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so if Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then it must be in the upper position.

Response 1:
Knowledge:
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the shoe store cannot be at either end of the row because the pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other end. This means that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be next to one of the restaurants. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
 
A: The pharmacy and a restaurant cannot be immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other end.
B: The pharmacy cannot be immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other end. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be next to one of the restaurants.
C: The two restaurants cannot be immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
D: One of the restaurants must be immediately on either side of the toy store, but this cannot be the case if the optometrist and shoe store are next to each other.
E: The restaurant cannot be immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the order of businesses in the row is as follows:
  [pharmacy], [optometrist], [shoe store], [?], [?], [?], [restaurant]
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, so the pharmacy must be in space 1.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant must be in space 7.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 5.
  Therefore, the order of businesses in the row is as follows:
  [pharmacy], [optometrist], [shoe store], [veterinarian], [toy store], [?], [restaurant]
  
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the only possible arrangement is:
  [pharmacy], [optometrist], [shoe store], [veterinarian], [toy store], [restaurant], [restaurant]
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the veterinarian.

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist, shoe store, and the businesses immediately on either side of this pair are: (1) optometrist, (2) shoe store, (3) ?, (4) ?
  
  - From the given choices, only A and B have the pharmacy in them since it has to be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - From the given choices, only B has the toy store next to the pharmacy.
  - Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The optometrist is next to the shoe store.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
We can use the given information to deduce the positions of some of the businesses:
  - The pharmacy must be at either end of the row. Let's assume it is at space 1 without loss of generality.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, i.e., at space 7.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since there are only five spaces left, the only possible arrangement is 2-4-6 for the two restaurants and the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be at space 3 or 5, since those spaces are adjacent to the veterinarian. Therefore, the toy store must be at space 2 or 6.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy is at space 1, the optometrist must be at space 2 and the veterinarian at space 3.
  
Now we can answer the question:
  - If the optometrist is at space 2 and the shoe store is at space 3, then the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be the pharmacy and the toy store.
  Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row, numbered 1 through 7.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are three possible scenarios: optometrist and shoe store are in spaces 1 and 2, spaces 2 and 3, or spaces 6 and 7.
  
Analysis:
  - If the optometrist and shoe store are in spaces 1 and 2, the pharmacy must be in space 3. The two restaurants must be in spaces 4 and 7, and the toy store and veterinarian must be in spaces 5 and 6, but it is not possible to satisfy the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist and shoe store are in spaces 2 and 3, the pharmacy can be in space 1 or 4. If the pharmacy is in space 1, the two restaurants must be in spaces 5 and 7, and the toy store and veterinarian must be in spaces 4 and 6. If the pharmacy is in space 4, the two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 5, and the toy store and veterinarian must be in spaces 6 and 7. In both cases, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  - If the optometrist and shoe store are in spaces 6 and 7, the pharmacy must be in space 5. The two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 4, and the toy store and veterinarian must be in spaces 2 and 3, but it is not possible to satisfy the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly three kinds of cookies are made - oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a schedule for the batches of cookies:
Monday: oatmeal 1, sugar 1, peanut butter 1
Tuesday: sugar 2, oatmeal 2, peanut butter 2
Wednesday: peanut butter 3, sugar 3, oatmeal 3
Thursday: oatmeal 1, sugar 2, peanut butter 3
Friday: sugar 1, oatmeal 2, peanut butter 2 (assuming one batch is made on Friday)

Given this schedule, we can see that:
A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. (False)
B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday. (True)
C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. (False)
D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. (False)

Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  3. Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  4. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  5. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  6. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  7. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  From (4), there are at most 3 batches made on any given day. Since there are 3 batches of each kind of cookie made each week, and there are 5 weekdays, it follows that there must be exactly one day on which only one batch of cookies is made. If that day is Friday, then it must be one of the sugar cookies batches, since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This leaves only one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies to be made on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. From (6), the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, which eliminates option D. The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday, which eliminates option B. The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday, which eliminates option A. The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday, which eliminates option C. This leaves only option E as a possibility.

  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday since the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day.
  - The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday since there is only one batch made on Friday.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - The second batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Tuesday since it is not excluded by any of the given conditions.
  
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, one batch per day from Monday to Friday.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are two batches made on Monday through Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are three batches of each kind of cookie and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, each day must have one batch of each kind of cookie.
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are two batches made on Monday through Thursday. This means that one of the three kinds of cookies will not have a batch made on Friday.
  - We need to find an option that satisfies the given conditions.

Solution:
  - Option A violates the condition that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - Option B violates the condition that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - Option C violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - Option D violates the condition that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies.
  - Option E satisfies all the given conditions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are only three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - There are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week.
  - Each batch is made on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there must be two batches of cookies made on either Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
  - Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, there cannot be any sugar cookies made on any other day.
  - The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because there must be at least one batch of cookies made on Monday, and that batch cannot be a batch of sugar cookies.
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day.
  - The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because there are only three batches of each kind of cookie made each week.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Wednesday, which would mean that there are two batches of oatmeal cookies made on Tuesday and two batches of sugar cookies made on Thursday.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Three batches of each type of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made from start to finish on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are two possibilities:
    - One batch of oatmeal cookies, one batch of peanut butter cookies, and one batch of sugar cookies are made on Friday.
    - Two batches of the same type of cookie are made on Friday.
  - A cannot be true because the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - B cannot be true because the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
  - C cannot be true because the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday.
  - D cannot be true because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday or Thursday.
  - E could be true because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, which leaves Wednesday and Thursday for the two batches of sugar cookies and the remaining batch of oatmeal cookies.

  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M., then the mystery cannot be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M. because the horror and the mystery must be shown on different screens. Therefore, the list "the sci-fi film, the mystery" cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies, and each movie is shown exactly once.

  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  For screen 2, we know that it shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  We also know that the romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be one of the other four movies.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 2.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be on either screen 1 or screen 2.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does, so it cannot be shown after the horror film.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M., then the mystery cannot be shown on screen 2, because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the list "the sci-fi film, the mystery" cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening.

  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the horror film cannot be paired with the mystery on screen 2. 
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does. Therefore, the western cannot be shown after the horror film on screen 2.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. Therefore, the sci-fi film must be shown on either screen 1 or 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2. Therefore, the romance must be shown on either screen 1 or 3.
  Since screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., the remaining movies (western, horror, and mystery) must be shown on screen 2, with one movie beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the only option that violates the given conditions is option B: the sci-fi film, the mystery.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven businesses in the shopping center: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must not be a toy store and a veterinarian in either order. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 2 or space 6, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in either space 1 or space 7. If the veterinarian is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7, which violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 7, and the restaurant must be in space 1. Since the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be in space 6 and the optometrist in space 2. Thus, the shoe store is not next to the veterinarian, and the only statement that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The shoe store is in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  Since the shoe store is in space 4, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be in space 1 and space 7, but we don't know which one is in which space. Also, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so we can deduce that the optometrist, the toy store, and the veterinarian must be in space 2, 3, 5, and 6. Additionally, we know that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be next to the restaurant in space 7. Finally, we know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Action: Answer("B")  
The pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it must be next to the veterinarian, which means the veterinarian is in space 3. Therefore, the optometrist is in space 2, and the two restaurants are in space 1 and space 7. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it must be in space 6, and the other restaurant must be in space 5. Therefore, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, and the shoe store is not next to the toy store. The only option that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, so the answer is B.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The shoe store is in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  We know that the shoe store is in space 4, so we can deduce the locations of some of the other businesses based on the given constraints. 
  Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it cannot be next to the shoe store in space 4. Therefore, the pharmacy must be at either space 1 or space 7. 
  If the pharmacy is at space 1, then the restaurant must be at space 7. This means that the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2, and the other restaurant must be in space 5 or 6. However, this violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the pharmacy must be at space 7, and the restaurant must be at space 1. This means that the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6, and the other restaurant must be in space 2 or 3. 
  We also know that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy is in space 7, this means that the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6. 
  Finally, we know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Since the shoe store is in space 4, this means that the toy store must be in either space 2 or space 6. 

Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, if the shoe store is in space 4, then one of the following must be true: a restaurant is next to the toy store.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - A shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
If the shoe store is in space 4, then we can deduce that the optometrist and one of the restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7, respectively. That leaves three spaces between the two restaurants, which means we can place the pharmacy in space 2 or 6. However, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the veterinarian must be in space 3 or 5. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the toy store must be in the remaining space. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, making choice B the correct answer.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Analysis:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be next to the shoe store in space 4.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant at the other end of the row cannot be next to the shoe store in space 4.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and since it cannot be next to the shoe store in space 4, it must be next to the other end of the row. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 2 or space 6.
  - If the optometrist is in space 3, then the restaurant must be in space 7, and the shoe store cannot be next to the toy store. Therefore, the optometrist must be next to a restaurant.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The shoe store is in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or 7 because it must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 2 or 6. If the pharmacy is in space 2, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 1. If the pharmacy is in space 6, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 7. In either case, the restaurant that is not at the end of the row must be in space 5. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the toy store must be in space 3, and the remaining business, which is either the optometrist or the veterinarian, must be in space 1 or 7. Therefore, the following must be true:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant. - Not necessarily true.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. - Not necessarily true.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store. - True.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store. - Not true.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian. - Not true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, we know that the restaurant that is not at the end of the row must be either in space 2 or space 6.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and there are only five spaces left between the two possible locations for the restaurants, we know that the optometrist, veterinarian, and toy store must be in spaces 3, 5, and 7, in some order.
  - Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the pharmacy cannot be in space 2 or space 6, we know that the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7, and the optometrist or veterinarian must be in the other of those two spaces.
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, we know that the toy store must be in space 7 and the veterinarian in space 5.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - A shopping center has exactly seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
If the shoe store is in space 4, then the optometrist and the veterinarian cannot be in spaces 3 and 5. Therefore, the pharmacy must be at one of the ends, which means it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it follows that the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, choice B is the correct answer.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row in the shopping center.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the shoe store is in space 4, we know that the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 1 and 7.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2. If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6.
  - If the optometrist or the veterinarian is in space 2, then the other one must be in space 3 or space 5. If the optometrist or the veterinarian is in space 6, then the other one must be in space 5 or space 3.
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
  - Therefore, the toy store must be in either space 2 or space 6.
  - If the toy store is in space 2, then a restaurant must be in space 7 and the other restaurant must be in space 5. This means that the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 3, and the other one must be in space 1. This also means that the shoe store is not next to the toy store or the veterinarian.
  - If the toy store is in space 6, then a restaurant must be in space 1 and the other restaurant must be in space 3. This means that the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 5, and the other one must be in space 7. This also means that the shoe store is not next to the toy store or the veterinarian.
  - Therefore, we can eliminate options D and E.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7. If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the restaurant must be in space 1.
  - Therefore, the restaurant is next to the pharmacy, and option B is true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven businesses: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  According to the given constraints, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. If the shoe store is in space 4, then the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the optometrist cannot be in space 6 because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the veterinarian must be in space 6. This means that the toy store must be in space 5, and according to the constraint, it cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 3. This leaves the two restaurants to be in spaces 1 and 2, and the shoe store in space 4. Thus, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, which is choice B.

Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the colors of those two rugs CANNOT be
Choices:
  A: forest and peach
  B: forest and yellow
  C: peach and turquoise
  D: peach and yellow
  E: turquoise and yellow
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We need to find the pair of colors that cannot be used to make two solid rugs.
  Solid rugs are woven in a single color.
  We have six colors: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Five colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Solution:
  Let's consider the possible combinations of two solid rugs:
    - forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white
    - forest, olive, peach, turquoise, yellow
    - forest, olive, peach, white, yellow
    - forest, olive, turquoise, white, yellow
    - forest, peach, turquoise, white, yellow
    - olive, peach, turquoise, white, yellow
  Now we need to find the pair of colors that cannot be used to make two solid rugs.
  Let's check each option:
    - A: forest and peach
      If we choose forest and peach, then we can make two solid rugs as follows:
        - Rug 1: forest
        - Rug 2: peach
      So, we can't eliminate this option.
    - B: forest and yellow
      If we choose forest and yellow, then we can make two solid rugs as follows:
        - Rug 1: forest
        - Rug 2: yellow
      So, we can't eliminate this option.
    - C: peach and turquoise
      If we choose peach and turquoise, then we can make two solid rugs as follows:
        - Rug 1: peach
        - Rug 2: turquoise
      So, we can't eliminate this option.
    - D: peach and yellow
      If we choose peach and yellow, then we can't make two solid rugs because both colors can't be used together in a rug.
      So, we can eliminate this option.
    - E: turquoise and yellow
      If we choose turquoise and yellow, then we can make two solid rugs as follows:
        - Rug 1: turquoise
        - Rug 2: yellow
      So, we can't eliminate this option.
  Therefore, the answer is D: peach and yellow.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We need to find the pair of colors that cannot be used to make solid rugs, given the given rules.
  A: This pair of colors does not violate any of the given rules.
  B: This pair of colors does not violate any of the given rules.
  C: This pair of colors violates the rule that peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  D: This pair of colors violates the rule that peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  E: This pair of colors violates the rules that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, and peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  We need to find which pair of colors cannot be used in the two solid rugs.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  If white is used in a rug, two other colors are also used.
  Olive and peach are used together in a rug.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug. 
  If white is used in a rug, two other colors are also used. Thus, white cannot be used in a solid rug.
  Olive and peach are used together in a rug. Thus, olive and peach cannot be used in separate solid rugs.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Thus, forest and turquoise can be used in separate solid rugs.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Thus, peach and turquoise can be used in separate solid rugs.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug. Thus, peach and yellow can be used in separate solid rugs.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The question provides rules for weaving three rugs using six colors of thread.
  Exactly five colors will be used and each color will be used in only one rug.
  In any rug with white, two other colors are used.
  In any rug with olive, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  There are exactly two solid rugs.
  
  We need to determine which color pairs cannot be used in the two solid rugs.
  
Analysis:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then one rug must be multicolored.
  If the multicolored rug uses white, then two other colors must also be used.
  If the multicolored rug uses olive, then peach must also be used.
  Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  
  If we try to use forest and peach in the two solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must use olive, white, and turquoise, which is not possible. So, A is not possible.
  
  If we try to use forest and yellow in the two solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must use white, peach, and turquoise, which is possible because the multicolored rug can use white, peach, and turquoise, and the other solid rug can use forest. So, B is possible.
  
  If we try to use peach and turquoise in the two solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must use white, olive, and yellow, which is not possible because the multicolored rug cannot use peach and yellow together. So, C is not possible.
  
  If we try to use peach and yellow in the two solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must use white, olive, and turquoise, which is possible because the multicolored rug can use white, olive, and turquoise, and the other solid rug can use peach. So, D is possible.
  
  If we try to use turquoise and yellow in the two solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must use white, olive, and peach, which is possible because the multicolored rug can use white, olive, and peach, and the other solid rug can use turquoise. So, E is possible.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are six colors of thread available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Each rug is either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  If white is used in a rug, two other colors are also used.
  If olive is used in a rug, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of the five colors must be used in exactly one rug. 
  The colors forest and peach cannot be used together in a multicolored rug because forest and peach are not allowed to be used together in a rug. 
  The colors forest and yellow can be used together in a multicolored rug (with a third color) or in two separate solid rugs.
  The colors peach and turquoise can be used together in a multicolored rug (with a third color) or in two separate solid rugs.
  The colors peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be used in two separate solid rugs. 
  The colors turquoise and yellow can be used together in a multicolored rug (with a third color) or in two separate solid rugs. 
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be peach and yellow.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Two solid rugs means that each rug will be woven in a single color.
  We need to find a pair of colors that cannot be used to weave two solid rugs.
  We will use the given rules to eliminate the pairs of colors that cannot be used together to weave two solid rugs.
  We will keep the pairs that can be used to weave two solid rugs.
  A: forest and peach cannot be used together in a rug. They cannot be used to weave two solid rugs.
  B: forest and yellow can be used together in a rug. They can be used to weave two solid rugs.
  C: peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. They cannot be used to weave two solid rugs.
  D: peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug. They cannot be used to weave two solid rugs.
  E: turquoise and yellow can be used together in a rug. They can be used to weave two solid rugs.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We are told that there are exactly two solid rugs, so the third rug must be multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis:
  Let's consider each option:
  A: forest and peach - Forest and peach can be used together in a rug, and since there are exactly two solid rugs, this combination could be used for the solid rugs. Therefore, this option is not the correct answer.
  B: forest and yellow - Forest and yellow can be used together in a rug, and since there are exactly two solid rugs, this combination could be used for the solid rugs. Therefore, this option is not the correct answer.
  C: peach and turquoise - Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, this option is a possible answer.
  D: peach and yellow - Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, this option is a possible answer.
  E: turquoise and yellow - Turquoise and yellow can be used together in a rug, and since there are exactly two solid rugs, this combination could be used for the solid rugs. Therefore, this option is not the correct answer.
  
Action: Answer("CD")  (Both C and D are possible answers)
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are six colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Each rug will use exactly five colors.
  Each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
  If white is used in a rug, two other colors must be used in that rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, peach must also be used in that rug.
  Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of those two rugs will use only one color.
  There are a total of three rugs, so the remaining rug must be multicolored and use three colors.
  If white is used in a rug, two other colors must be used in that rug, so white cannot be used in a solid rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, peach must also be used in that rug, so olive and peach cannot be used in separate solid rugs.
  Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot both be used in separate solid rugs.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot both be used in separate solid rugs.
  Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot both be used in separate solid rugs.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  We need to find two colors that cannot be used in solid rugs if there are exactly two solid rugs.
  We know that there are six colors available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  We also know that the rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the other rug must be multicolored.
  If white is used in one of the solid rugs, then two other colors must be used, which means that the other solid rug must be a single color that is not white.
  If olive is used in one of the solid rugs, then peach must also be used, which means that the other solid rug cannot be peach.
  If forest is used in one of the solid rugs, then turquoise cannot be used in the other solid rug.
  If peach is used in one of the solid rugs, then yellow cannot be used in the other solid rug.
  If turquoise is used in one of the solid rugs, then yellow cannot be used in the other solid rug.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The question states that there are exactly two solid rugs.
  We need to find a pair of colors that cannot be used together in a solid rug.
  In a solid rug, only one color is used, so the rules that involve two colors used together do not apply.
  We need to check which pairs of colors cannot be used together in one solid rug.
  If a color is used in one solid rug, then it cannot be used in the other solid rug or in any of the multicolored rugs.
  A: forest and peach are not restricted from being used together in a solid rug.
  B: forest and yellow are not restricted from being used together in a solid rug.
  C: peach and turquoise are restricted from being used together in any rug, but they are not restricted from being used together in a solid rug because only one color is used in a solid rug.
  D: peach and yellow are restricted from being used together in any rug, but they are not restricted from being used together in a solid rug because only one color is used in a solid rug.

Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: Verma could be the project leader if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then she must be one of the three selected members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is selected.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, if Verma is a project member, then Smith must also be.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then that person must also be the project leader. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Quinn or Ruiz cannot be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
  Verma could be the project leader if neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Elimination:
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Smith and Taylor must be the other two members. 
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Wells cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, Verma can be the project leader only if Quinn or Ruiz is a project member and neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Elimination:
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. So, if Verma is the project leader, Smith must be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. So, either Ruiz or Verma can be a project member only if Wells is not a project member.
  
Test each answer choice:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then either Ruiz or Verma must be the project leader, because only they can lead the project. However, if Verma is the project leader, Smith must be a project member, which is not possible because Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, Verma could not be the project leader if neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. Eliminate A.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Quinn, Smith, Wells, and Xue must be the project members. Therefore, Verma could be the project leader if neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. Keep B.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, because only they can lead the project. However, if Verma is the project leader, Smith must be a project member, which is not possible because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, Verma could not be the project leader if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. Eliminate C.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Taylor must be a project member. Therefore, Verma could not be the project leader if neither Smith nor Xue is selected because if Verma is the project leader, Smith must be a project member, which is not possible if Smith is not selected. Eliminate D.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, because only they can lead the project. However, if Verma is the project leader, Smith must be a project member, which is not possible because if Taylor is not selected, Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, Verma could not be the project leader if neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. Eliminate E.

Answer: B
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The project leader must be one of the three selected workers.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Elimination:
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then it is impossible for Quinn or Ruiz to be the project leader, so Verma cannot be the project leader. Eliminated.
  B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then it is impossible for Quinn or Ruiz to be the project leader, so Verma cannot be the project leader. Eliminated.
  C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then it is impossible for Smith to be a project member, so Verma cannot be the project leader. Eliminated.
  D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then it is possible for Smith to be a project member and Taylor to not be a project member, which satisfies the constraints, so Verma could be the project leader. Keep.
  E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then it is possible for Smith to be a project member and Taylor to not be a project member, which satisfies the constraints, so Verma could be the project leader. Keep.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be one of the three project members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, they must be the project leader.
  If Wells is selected, Ruiz and Verma cannot be selected.
  If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Verma must be one of the three project members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then that person must be the project leader, which means Verma cannot be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected, which means Verma cannot be selected.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected, which means Verma cannot be the project leader if Smith is selected.
  Therefore, for Verma to be the project leader, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be selected, and neither Smith nor Taylor can be selected. This leaves options (B) and (D).
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be one of the three selected project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Verma must be one of the three selected project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. So, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. So, Smith and Taylor must be selected together.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then that person must be the project leader. So, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be selected as a project member if they are not the project leader.
  Therefore, the only possible selection that allows Verma to be the project leader is if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the seven workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then she must be one of the three project members selected.
  If Wells is not selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members. Therefore, Verma cannot be one of the project members and, consequently, cannot be the project leader.
  If Taylor is not selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, because if Smith is a project member, then Taylor must be a project member. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member. This means that neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be project members, because if either Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be the project leader. This eliminates choices A, B, and C.
  If Smith is not selected, then Taylor cannot be a project member, because if Smith is a project member, then Taylor must be a project member. This means that neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be project members, because if either Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader. Therefore, if Smith is not a project member, then neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be the project leader. This eliminates choice D.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members. This means that the three project members must be selected from the group {Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, Xue}. The project leader must be one of the project members. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then she must be one of the project members selected. The only way for this to happen is if Smith, Taylor, and Wells are the three project members selected, and Verma is the project leader. This means that Verma could be the project leader if Wells is selected.

  The project leader must be one of the three project members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then he must be the project leader.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then he must be one of the three project members.
  If Verma is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. This means that Wells must be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Smith and Taylor must be the other two project members.
  Therefore, the correct answer is the option where Verma can be a project leader and these three workers are the project members and leader: Wells, Smith, and Taylor.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be selected among the three project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then she must be selected among the three project members. 
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Verma cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be selected.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader.
  So, neither Quinn nor Smith can be selected as a project member.
  Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the given constraints is (B) Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
- Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
- If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
- If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Analysis:
- If Verma is the project leader, then Wells is not a project member.
- If Wells is not a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
- If neither Ruiz nor Verma is a project member, then Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, because only they can be a project member if leading the project.
- So, if Verma is the project leader, then Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
- If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must be a project member too.
- So, if Verma is the project leader, then Smith cannot be a project member, otherwise Taylor must be a project member, which means that three people are already selected (Verma, the leader, and either Quinn or Ruiz as a project member), and there would be no spot left for Verma.
- Therefore, Verma could be the project leader only if Smith is not selected.

Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown in the afternoon.
  C: L is shown in the evening.
  D: M is shown in the morning.
  E: M is shown in the afternoon.

  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Elimination:
  A: K cannot be shown in the evening.
  B: L can be shown in the afternoon, but it is not a must.
  C: J must be shown in the evening, so L cannot be shown in the evening. 
  D: M cannot be shown in the morning.
  E: L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. So, M cannot be shown in the afternoon.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show 7 houses in a single day.
  The first and second houses will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Analysis:
  Since J must be shown in the evening and only two houses are shown in the evening, J must be either the sixth or the seventh house.
  Since K cannot be shown in the morning, K must be either the third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh house.
  Since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, L must be either the fourth or the fifth house.
  Therefore, the possible order of the houses is:
  Morning: [__] [__]
  Afternoon: [__] [__] [__]
  Evening: [__] [__]
  J must be either the sixth or the seventh house.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh house.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L must be either the fourth or the fifth house.
  Therefore, the possible order of the houses is:
  Morning: [__] [__]
  Afternoon: [__] [__] [__]
  Evening: [__] [J or __]
  Since K cannot be shown in the morning, K must be either the third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh house.
  If K is the third house, then L must be the fourth house, which means M must be the fifth house. This leaves only N and O for the evening, but neither of them can be J, so this option is not possible.
  If K is the fourth house, then L must be the fifth house, which means M must be the fourth house. This leaves only N and O for the evening, and one of them must be J, so this option is possible.
  If K is the fifth house, then L must be the fourth house, which means M must be the fifth house. This leaves only N and O for the evening, but neither of them can be J, so this option is not possible.
  If K is the sixth house, then L must be the fourth house, which means M must be the fifth house. This leaves only N and O for the evening, but neither of them can be J, so this option is not possible.
  If K is the seventh house, then L must be the fourth house, which means M must be the fifth house. This leaves only N and O for the evening, and one of them must be J, so this option is possible.

  L must be shown after K and before M.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  
Analysis:
  From the rules, we know that J must be shown in the evening, and K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. Additionally, L must be shown after K and before M. Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon or evening, and M must be shown in the afternoon or morning. 

Action: Answer("E") 
Therefore, the only option that must be true is that M is shown in the afternoon.

  - K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  - L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Since K cannot be shown in the morning, L must be shown in the afternoon or evening, and M must be shown in the evening.
  - The remaining houses N, O, and P can be shown in any order in the morning or afternoon.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.

  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  
Analysis:
  J is shown in the evening and the first and second houses are shown in the morning, so J cannot be the first or second house.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L cannot be the first or second house.
  M is shown after L, so M cannot be the first, second, or third house.
  Therefore, M must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  The remaining houses are N, O, and P. None of them have any specific time restrictions.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the three ambassadorships.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Jaramillo must be assigned to one of the other two ambassadorships.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must be assigned to the remaining ambassadorship. Therefore, Jaramillo is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, so option A is incorrect. Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships, so option D is also incorrect. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, so option C is incorrect. Therefore, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia, which makes option B true. Option E is incorrect because we don't have any information about Ong's assignment if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo is also assigned as ambassador to one of the other two countries (Venezuela or Zambia).
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Landon is not assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong may or may not be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, Kayne must be assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia.

Analysis:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship, so he cannot be assigned to Venezuela or Zambia.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, Kayne must be assigned to an ambassadorship, but he cannot be assigned to Yemen since Kayne is already assigned to Yemen. Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned to Venezuela.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen, so Kayne must be assigned to Zambia, and Landon cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must be assigned to Yemen, and Novetzke must be assigned to Venezuela, leaving Ong to be assigned to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship. If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, the only option left is to assign Landon as ambassador to Zambia.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it must be Zambia.
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship, which means that Jaramillo cannot be assigned to an ambassadorship since it is stated that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, so the answer is D.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned as ambassador to any country.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo is also assigned as ambassador to one of the other two countries.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must also be assigned as ambassador to one of the other two countries. However, we don't know which country Jaramillo will be assigned to. We also know that if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  - If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must also be assigned as an ambassador.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador, then Kayne must also be assigned as an ambassador.
  - If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia.
  - If Landon is assigned as ambassador, then it must be to Zambia.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which contradicts the given information that Kayne must be assigned as ambassador if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, if Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then only Landon and Ong would be left to be assigned to Zambia and Venezuela, respectively. This would satisfy all the constraints, so it is possible that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship. Thus, (D) Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship must be true.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Analysis:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships. So, Jaramillo, Landon, or Ong must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela and Zambia. But, if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne must be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned to Venezuela. Similarly, if Landon is assigned to Zambia, then Ong must be assigned to Venezuela, which is also a contradiction. Therefore, Landon cannot be assigned to Zambia. This means that Ong must be assigned to Zambia and Jaramillo must be assigned to Venezuela.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned as ambassador to any of the three countries.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one of the countries, then Kayne must also be assigned as ambassador to one of the countries.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned as ambassador, it must be to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must also be assigned as ambassador to one of the countries. However, we cannot determine which country Jaramillo will be assigned to. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are six solos to be performed, one by each member of the band.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who cannot perform the third solo, we need to work backwards from the last solo:
- The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
- Therefore, the saxophonist must perform the sixth solo.
- The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
- Therefore, the keyboard player must perform the fifth solo.
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
- Therefore, the guitarist must perform the first, second, or third solo.
- The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
- Therefore, the percussionist must perform the first, second, or third solo.
- We know that the saxophonist performs the sixth solo, so the percussionist cannot perform the third solo, because the saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Six members of the band perform exactly one solo each.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
To find out who cannot perform the third solo, let's try to determine who can perform the third solo:
  - The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform either the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  
Now, let's see who cannot perform the third solo:
  - If the guitarist performs the first solo, then the percussionist must perform the second solo, the keyboard player must perform the third solo, and the saxophonist must perform the fourth, fifth, or sixth solo. Therefore, the guitarist can perform the first solo but not the third solo.
  - If the guitarist performs the second solo, then the percussionist can perform either the first or second solo, the keyboard player must perform the third solo, and the saxophonist must perform the fourth, fifth, or sixth solo. Therefore, the guitarist can perform the second solo but not the third solo.
  - If the guitarist performs the third solo, then the percussionist must perform the first solo, the keyboard player must perform the second solo, and the saxophonist must perform the fourth, fifth, or sixth solo. Therefore, the guitarist can perform the third solo.
  - If the saxophonist performs the fourth, fifth, or sixth solo, then the percussionist must perform the first or second solo, the keyboard player must perform the second or third solo, and the guitarist must perform the first or second solo. Therefore, the saxophonist can perform the fourth, fifth, or sixth solo but not the third solo.
  
Therefore, the answer is E: violinist. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Each member of the band performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  From the given restrictions, we know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. 
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player, and the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist. 
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. 
  Therefore, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the trumpeter, as the saxophonist must perform after the trumpeter, and the guitarist, percussionist, keyboard player, and violinist all have a specific time slot for their solos.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Elimination:
  We know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist. 
  We also know that the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does, so the keyboard player can perform the third solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does, so the percussionist cannot perform the third solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist can perform the third solo only if the percussionist or the trumpeter performs the second solo. 
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, the trumpeter cannot perform the third solo.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are six solos in total, each member must perform exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the fourth solo must be performed by one of the other five members.
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the keyboard player must perform the fifth or sixth solo.
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so the violinist must perform the first or second solo, and the keyboard player must perform the fifth solo.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. This means that the saxophonist must perform either the second, third, fourth, or sixth solo.
  - Therefore, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the guitarist, because the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo and the keyboard player must perform the fifth solo.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band, each one performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  To determine who performs the third solo, we need to use the given information to narrow down the possibilities. The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the first or second solo. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player cannot perform the fifth or sixth solo. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitarist must perform either the first or the second solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the first or the second solo. We can now create a chart to keep track of the possibilities:

  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
  |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
  | G   | P   |     |     | K   | V/S |
  
  The saxophonist must perform the third solo. Therefore, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the trumpeter.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  If the violinist performs the third solo, then the keyboard player must perform a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist. However, the guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so the keyboard player must perform the second solo. This leaves the percussionist, saxophonist, and trumpeter to perform the remaining solos, but the saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo, because if they did, the remaining solos would have to be performed in an order that violates the given restrictions. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Solution:
  We know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  We know that the percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo.
  We know that the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo.
  We know that the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  Since the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, the guitarist must perform either the first or second solo. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform the third solo.
  Thus, the answer is not the keyboard player, so the answer is not B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist does, then the percussionist must perform either first, second, or third. If the saxophonist performs a solo after the trumpeter does, then the trumpeter must perform either first, second, or third. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo, since it is the only solo that cannot be performed after both the percussionist and the trumpeter.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logic:
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so they must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so they must perform either the first or second solo.
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so they must perform either the second or third solo.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, so they must perform either the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  - The only member who has not been accounted for is the trumpeter, who must perform either the first, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  - Therefore, the possible order of solos is: percussionist, keyboard player, trumpeter, violinist, saxophonist, guitarist OR percussionist, keyboard player, violinist, trumpeter, saxophonist, guitarist.
  
  A: The guitarist can perform the first, second, or fifth solo, so they could potentially perform the third solo. INCORRECT.
  B: The keyboard player can perform the second or third solo, so they could potentially perform the third solo. INCORRECT.
  C: The saxophonist can perform the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo, so they could potentially perform the third solo. INCORRECT.
  D: The trumpeter can perform the first, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo, so they could potentially perform the third solo. CORRECT.
  E: The violinist can perform the fourth or fifth solo, so they could potentially perform the third solo. INCORRECT.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) will have two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, it means that the remaining photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes since Fuentes is the only photographer left. This satisfies the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, it means that there is no photograph by Gagnon in the Sports section. Therefore, we can conclude that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, which is option B.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - 6 photographs will be selected, 2 for each of the 3 sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
  - Each photographer must have at least 1 but no more than 3 photographs in total.
  - At least one Lifestyle photograph must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section (due to the constraint that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section). Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, it follows that Hue must have at least one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon, so the answer is B.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of the newspaper each have exactly 2 photographs.
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the other photographs in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
  Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, so neither of the Sports section photographs can be by Gagnon.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
- Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
- Each photograph is taken by Fuentes, Gagnon, or Hue.
- Each photographer must have at least one photograph but no more than three photographs.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the other two photographers' photographs in the Lifestyle section must be taken by Fuentes. This means that Fuentes has at least two photographs, one in the Lifestyle section and one in the Sports section. In order to satisfy the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, Hue must have at least two photographs, one in the Lifestyle section and one in the Sports section. Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore:

A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. - This is not necessarily true.
B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. - This is not necessarily true.
C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - This is not possible since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - This is not necessarily true.
E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - This is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, Sports) has exactly two photographs.
  - Each photographer can have between one and three photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
- The other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
- At least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes (because of the previous point).
- Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.

Analysis of the choices:
  A: This could be true, but it is not a necessary conclusion.
  B: This could be true, but it is not a necessary conclusion.
  C: This cannot be true, because Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  D: This could be true, but it is not a necessary conclusion.
  E: This cannot be true, because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

Therefore, the answer is A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section must have exactly two photographs.
  - Each photographer must have at least one photograph but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one Lifestyle photograph must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - Gagnon's photographs cannot be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have one photograph in the Metro section and one photograph in the Sports section. This is because at least one Lifestyle photograph must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Since Gagnon has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, and none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, then Gagnon's photographs must be in the Metro section. Therefore, we can conclude that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there are two possibilities for the Metro section: either both photographs are by Fuentes or one is by Fuentes and the other is by Gagnon. However, the first possibility violates the condition that there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, which means that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. So, the answer is B.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) has exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, we can deduce the following:
  - The remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  - The photograph by Gagnon cannot be in the Sports section.
  - The photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section must be matched by a photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section.
  - The photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section cannot be matched by a photograph by Gagnon.
  
Analysis:
  A: There is no information to support this statement.
  B: There is no information to support this statement.
  C: This statement is not possible because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  D: This statement is possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  E: This statement is not possible because the photograph by Gagnon cannot be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) must have exactly two photographs, and each photograph must be taken by one of the three photographers.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section (due to the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section). Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, it follows that Fuentes must have exactly one photograph in the Metro section and one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six different photographs, exactly two photographs per section in three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there are two possibilities for the third photographer's photograph in the Lifestyle section: it could be by Fuentes or by Gagnon. 
However, since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, Gagnon must also have a photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. 
So, the answer is B.

  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  Let's consider the different options:
  A: If exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, then all the batches for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday will be already assigned to a specific cookie, which contradicts the fact that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: If exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies will be made on the same day, which contradicts the fact that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: If at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday, then all the batches for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday will be already assigned to a specific cookie, which contradicts the fact that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: If at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday, then all the batches for Friday will be already assigned to a specific cookie, which contradicts the fact that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  E: If fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday, then all the batches for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday will be already assigned to a specific cookie, which contradicts the fact that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:

  There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Each type of cookie has three batches made each week.
  Each batch of cookies is made on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then either the first batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on Monday and the first batch of sugar cookies are made on Tuesday, or the first batch of sugar cookies are made on Tuesday and the first batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on Thursday.
  
  A: It is possible that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, but not necessarily true.
  B: It is possible that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday, but not necessarily true.
  C: If the first batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on Monday, and the first batch of sugar cookies are made on Tuesday, then it is true that at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday. However, if the first batch of sugar cookies are made on Tuesday, then it is not necessarily true that at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: If the first batch of sugar cookies are made on Tuesday, and the first batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on Thursday, then it is true that at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday. However, if the first batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on Monday, then it is not necessarily true that at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: It is not necessarily true that fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:

  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are two possible schedules for the cookies:
  Schedule 1: Monday - oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar; Tuesday - oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar; Thursday - oatmeal, sugar, peanut butter; Friday - oatmeal, sugar, peanut butter
  Schedule 2: Monday - oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar; Tuesday - oatmeal, sugar, peanut butter; Thursday - oatmeal, sugar, peanut butter; Friday - oatmeal, sugar, peanut butter
  
  A: This cannot be true because there are only three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  B: This cannot be true because there are only three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  C: This cannot be true because the condition states that "No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day."
  D: This must be true because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, and if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: This cannot be true because the condition states that "At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday."
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
- There are three batches of each type of cookie made every week.
- Each batch is made from start to finish on a single day.
- No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day.
- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
- At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

Action: Answer("B")  
If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on Friday (one of oatmeal or peanut butter, and one of sugar) to fulfill the requirement of three batches of each type of cookie per week. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. Answer B is correct.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the following must be true:
  - One batch of cookies must be made on Monday.
  - Two batches of cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  - Two batches of cookies must be made on Thursday.
  - One batch of cookies must be made on Friday.
  Since exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, we can infer that exactly one kind of cookie is made each day. Thus, we can deduce that:
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
  - The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday (not possible).
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, only choice B is valid.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The bakery makes three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be at least one batch of cookies made on each of the other four days of the week.
  
Analysis:
  Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, there must be at least one batch of cookies made on each of the other four days of the week. 
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so there must be at least three batches of cookies made on the other three days of the week.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so we know that there is only one batch of sugar cookies made on any other day of the week.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so we know that there is only one batch of oatmeal cookies made on any other day of the week.
  
Solution:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be at least one batch of cookies made on each of the other four days of the week. 
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies must be made on both Tuesday and Friday, which means that options A and B are both possible.
  We cannot conclude that at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday or Thursday, so options C and D are not necessarily true.
  We do not have enough information to compare the number of batches of cookies made on Monday and Tuesday, so option E is not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Three batches of each type of cookie are made each week.
  Each batch is made on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there can be at most two batches of cookies made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there can be at most two batches of cookies made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. This means that exactly one of the following must be true: 
  - Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  - Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  - At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  - At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  - Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must have been made on Monday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Tuesday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must have been made on Wednesday. This leaves the third batch of oatmeal cookies to be made on Thursday, the third batch of peanut butter cookies to be made on Friday, and the third batch of sugar cookies to be made on Monday. Thus, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Three kinds of cookie: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  - If the first batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Thus, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, which means the second batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday. This is a contradiction.
  - Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which means the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Thus, no batch of cookies is made on Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:

  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams, one with two members and one with three members.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members and the red team must have two members. 
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be on the green team. 
  Juana cannot be on the same team as Olga, so she must be on the red team. 
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so she cannot be on the same team as Olga, and must be on the red team with Juana. 
  Mei is the only person left and must be on the green team with Lateefah and Olga, but we do not know if she is a facilitator or not.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams: one with two members and another with three members.

  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be part of the team with three members, which is the green team.
  Juana cannot be on the green team, so she must be on the red team with Mei.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so she cannot be on the same team as Olga, who is a facilitator.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The two teams are the green team and the red team.
  One team has two members and the other has three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.

  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team has three members and the red team has two members.
  Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on the green team.
  Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana must be on the red team.
  Since Kelly is not a facilitator, she cannot be on the green team.
  Therefore, Kelly must be on the red team.
  Since the red team has only two members, Mei must be on the green team.
  Therefore, Lateefah and Olga are on the green team, and Juana, Kelly, and Mei are on the red team.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are two teams: green and red.
  - One team has 2 members, and the other has 3 members.
  - One member of each team is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.

  - Olga is a facilitator, so she is assigned to one of the teams, and the other facilitator is not Kelly.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, so Juana is assigned to the red team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator, so Mei must be the other facilitator.
  
Let's check the answer choices:

  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams, one with two members and the other with three members.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we know that Lateefah is assigned to the green team and Olga is a facilitator. Therefore, Olga must be the facilitator of the red team, which has three members. Since Juana must be assigned to a different team than Olga, Juana must be assigned to the green team, which has two members. This means that Mei must be assigned to the red team. Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Kelly must be a member of the green team. Therefore, Lateefah and Kelly are members of the green team, and Juana and Mei are members of the red team. 

Action: Answer("A")  
Therefore, Juana is assigned to the red team.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The teams are the green and the red team.
  - One team has two members, and the other has three members.
  - One member of each team is the facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Since Olga must be a facilitator and Lateefah is assigned to the green team, Olga must be assigned to the green team. Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana must be assigned to the red team. Therefore, Lateefah and Mei are the other members of the green team. Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Mei must be the facilitator of the green team. Therefore, Juana is not a facilitator, and neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, and one team has two members, and the other has three members, then the green team must have three members. Therefore, Juana and Olga are on different teams, and Juana must be on the red team. Since Kelly is not a facilitator, then Mei must be a facilitator.

  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, then the green team has three members, including one facilitator (Olga).
  Since Kelly is not a facilitator, then Kelly is assigned to the red team, which has two members, including one facilitator.
  Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, then Juana is assigned to the red team.
  Since Mei is the only student left, she must be assigned to the green team, but we don't know if she is a facilitator or not.

  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Since there are only two facilitators, and Olga is one of them, the other facilitator must be on the other team. Thus, Juana cannot be a facilitator. Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are two teams: the green team and the red team.
  2. One team has two members and the other has three members.
  3. One member of each team is a facilitator.
  4. Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  5. Kelly is not a facilitator.
  6. Olga is a facilitator.
  7. Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis: 
  From the given information, we know that Lateefah is assigned to the green team, and Olga is a facilitator, which means Olga is assigned to the red team. Also, Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the green team. Since the green team already has a facilitator (Lateefah), Juana and Mei must be assigned to the red team, and one of them must be a facilitator. Therefore, D must be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  RealProp owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Three types of trades are allowed.
  Trustcorp owns three buildings, all of which are class 2.
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp can only trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  After the trades, Trustcorp will own only class 1 and class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns two class 3 buildings. It cannot trade one of them for a class 1 building, because no one owns two class 1 buildings. Therefore, RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  Southco must have traded with Trustcorp, because Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings and Southco owns only one class 2 building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one building for one other building of the same class
  Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Solution:
  To ensure that Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it must trade all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings. Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it will have no buildings left after the trade. Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded its only class 2 building, the King Building, for two class 3 buildings. This means that Southco must have traded one of its class 2 buildings, the Lynch Building, to Trustcorp. Therefore, C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp must be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns 3 buildings (Garza Tower, Yates House, Zimmer House).
  Southco owns 2 buildings (Flores Tower, Lynch Building).
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings (King Building, Meyer Building, Ortiz Building).
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Possible trades are: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  We need to find a statement that must be true if Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp cannot trade any of its class 2 buildings. Therefore, it can only trade its class 1 or class 3 buildings. Since there is no way to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or a class 3 building for two class 3 buildings, Trustcorp must have traded a class 2 building for a class 1 or class 3 building. This means that either RealProp or Southco must have traded a class 2 building with Trustcorp.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp can only trade class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 and a class 2 building.
  RealProp can trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Southco can trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it can only trade class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings. This means that Trustcorp cannot make a trade with RealProp, who only owns a class 1 and two class 3 buildings. The only company that Trustcorp can make a trade with is Southco, who owns a class 1 and a class 2 building. If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings with Southco's class 2 building, it will receive two class 3 buildings in return. This means that Trustcorp will own at least one class 3 building after the trade. Therefore, B and E are false. Since Trustcorp cannot trade with RealProp, D and E are false. This leaves A and C as possible answers. However, we are not given enough information to determine whether RealProp owns a class 1 building or not. Therefore, the only possible answer is C, which states that Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns 1 class 1 building and 2 class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns 1 class 1 building and 1 class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns 3 class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings, then it must have traded them for either class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  - RealProp owns a class 1 building, so it could be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  - Southco owns a class 2 building, so it could be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  - Trustcorp owns 3 class 2 buildings, which could be traded for either 3 class 1 buildings or 6 class 3 buildings.
  - If Trustcorp trades all of its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings, then Southco must be one of the trading partners, since RealProp only owns one class 1 building.
  - If Southco trades its class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, then Trustcorp must be one of the trading partners, since RealProp only owns class 3 buildings.
  - If Trustcorp trades all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings, then RealProp must be one of the trading partners, since Southco only owns one class 2 building.
  - Therefore, Southco must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
Analysis:
  To get rid of all class 2 buildings, Trustcorp must trade each of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have made trades with Southco, who owns a class 2 building.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, so A is possible.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building, so B is not true.
  Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp, so C is true.
  Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower, but it is a class 1 building, so D is not true.
  The Zimmer House is owned by RealProp, so E is not true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After some number of trades, Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it can only make trades involving class 2 buildings. 
  According to the three kinds of trades, Trustcorp can only trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  This means that the only buildings Trustcorp owns now are class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, so option A is possible.
  Southco owns only class 2 buildings before any trade, so option B is not possible.
  Since Trustcorp has no class 2 buildings left, it must have traded them to Southco, so option C is possible.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is a class 1 building, so option D is not possible.
  RealProp owns the Yates House and the Zimmer House, and the Zimmer House is a class 3 building, so option E is not possible.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
  A: We don't know if RealProp owns a class 1 building or not. We cannot infer this from the given information.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings, then Southco cannot own only class 2 buildings. Hence, this option is not true.
  C: We don't know if Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp or not. We cannot infer this from the given information.
  D: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Since Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it must have traded away all of its class 2 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower. Hence, this option is not true.
  E: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Since Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it must have traded away all of its class 2 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp does not own the Zimmer House. Hence, this option is not true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings. The only way Trustcorp can trade all of its class 2 buildings is if it trades each of them for a class 1 building or two class 3 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building for class 1 buildings or two class 3 buildings. This means that RealProp and Southco must have traded their class 1 buildings or class 2 buildings for Trustcorp's class 2 buildings. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.

    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2, then Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2, then Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or Trustcorp must trade a class 3 building for two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, then Trustcorp would own at least one class 2 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 3 building for two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades the Meyer Building or the Ortiz Building (both class 2), then Trustcorp would own at least one class 2 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade the King Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - Six bands will perform in the slots: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
Since Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, we know that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Xpert must perform in either slot five or slot six. Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots and Xpert cannot perform in slot six, Uneasy must perform in slot five. This means that Zircon must perform in slot four, and since Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, Vegemite must perform in slot three.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.

We can infer that Xpert must perform in slot six, and that the order of the other bands must be as follows:
  1. Yardsign
  2. Vegemite
  3. Wellspring
  4. Zircon
  5. Uneasy

A: Uneasy performs in slot five. - False, Uneasy must perform in slot four or later.
B: Vegemite performs in slot three. - True, Vegemite performs in slot three.
C: Wellspring performs in slot three. - False, Wellspring must perform in slot four or later.
D: Zircon performs in slot two. - False, Zircon must perform in slot four or later.
E: Zircon performs in slot four. - True, Zircon performs in slot four.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands will perform in six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order could be: _ _ _ WS X _ or _ _ _ _ WS X
  
Analysis:
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order could be: _ _ _ WS X _ or _ _ _ _ WS X
  - From the constraints, we know that Vegemite performs before Zircon, so Vegemite cannot perform after Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it cannot perform in slot five if Xpert performs in slot six.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it cannot perform in slot four if Wellspring performs in slot three.
  - If Zircon performs in slot two, then Vegemite must perform in slot one, which violates the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in slot four, then Uneasy must perform in slot five, which violates the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, if Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring could perform in slot three.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will fill the six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
Analysis:
  - Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Wellspring must perform in slot 1, 2, or 3.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Xpert must perform in slot 4 or 5.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign must perform in slot 1, 2, or 3.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in slot 4, 5, or 6.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite must perform in slot 1, 2, 3, or 4, and Zircon must perform in slot 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring must perform in slot 1 or 2, and Xpert must perform in slot 2 or 3. This means that Vegemite must perform in slot 1, and Zircon must perform in slot 6. If Uneasy performs in slot 5, then Yardsign must perform in slot 4, which satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the answer is (C) Wellspring performs in slot three.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Six slots are numbered from one to six.
  - Six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, the order could be one of the following:
    - Slot 1: Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Zircon, Uneasy
    - Slot 2: Vegemite, Yardsign, Wellspring, Xpert, Zircon, Uneasy
    - Slot 3: Yardsign, Vegemite, Xpert, Wellspring, Zircon, Uneasy
    - Slot 4: Vegemite, Yardsign, Xpert, Wellspring, Zircon, Uneasy
    - Slot 5: Xpert, Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Uneasy
    - Slot 6: Xpert, Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Uneasy, Zircon
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform in six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
Process of elimination: 
  - Option A: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, Uneasy cannot perform in slot five, because Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots and Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert. So, this option is not possible.
  - Option B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot six because Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. But, Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, so Zircon cannot perform in slot six. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - Option C: This option cannot be true because Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, so Wellspring cannot perform in slot three.
  - Option D: Zircon performs in slot two contradicts the condition that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - Option E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then Wellspring must perform in slot two and Xpert in slot three. This satisfies all the conditions given in the question. Therefore, this option could be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - The order of the six bands must meet the following constraints:
    1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the six bands could be one of the following:
    1. Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy
    2. Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Xpert, Wellspring, Uneasy
    3. Vegemite, Yardsign, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy
    4. Vegemite, Yardsign, Zircon, Xpert, Wellspring, Uneasy
    5. Vegemite, Zircon, Yardsign, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy
    6. Vegemite, Zircon, Yardsign, Xpert, Wellspring, Uneasy
Actions: 
- Option A is not possible because Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, so it cannot perform in slot five. Eliminate A.
- Option B is not possible because Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, so it cannot perform in slot three. Eliminate B.
- Option C is possible. Keep C.
- Option D is not possible because Zircon must perform in a slot earlier than Xpert, so it cannot perform in slot two. Eliminate D.
- Option E is not possible because Zircon must perform in a slot earlier than Xpert, so it cannot perform in slot four. Eliminate E.
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - Six bands will perform in one slot each.
  - Constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order must be one of the following:
    - [Yardsign], [Vegemite], [Wellspring], [Zircon], [Xpert], [Uneasy]
    - [Yardsign], [Vegemite], [Wellspring], [Zircon], [Uneasy], [Xpert]
    - [Vegemite], [Yardsign], [Wellspring], [Zircon], [Xpert], [Uneasy]
    - [Vegemite], [Yardsign], [Wellspring], [Zircon], [Uneasy], [Xpert]
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, the only possible order is [Yardsign], [Vegemite], [Wellspring], [Zircon], [Xpert], [Uneasy]. Therefore, the only answer that could be true is that Wellspring performs in slot three.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order must be Wellspring, Xpert.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
Analysis:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order must be Wellspring, Xpert. 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite must perform before Xpert. 
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Zircon must perform before Xpert. 
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in one of the slots 4, 5, or 6. 
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign must perform in one of the slots 1, 2, or 3.
  Therefore, the only possible options are A and D. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
  A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or two, which violates constraint 4. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot six, which violates constraint 1. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Xpert must perform in slot four, which violates constraint 5. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then Wellspring must perform in slot one and Xpert must perform in slot three, which satisfies all constraints. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then Wellspring must perform in slot three and Xpert must perform in slot five, which violates constraint 5. Therefore, E cannot be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must be assigned as well, so Jaramillo and Kayne will be assigned to two of the countries. Landon must be assigned to the remaining country, Zambia. And either Novetzke or Kayne will be assigned to Venezuela or Yemen. Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon. Answer("A").
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. And either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, and Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, Landon is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. 
  So, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Jaramillo must also be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. In this scenario, Landon would be assigned as ambassador to Zambia, and Novetzke would be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, and Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. In this scenario, Novetzke would not be assigned as an ambassador.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The question provides several constraints for the assignment of ambassadors to three different countries. 
  Ong is assigned to Venezuela, which means Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: 
  If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, so Kayne must be assigned to Zambia or Yemen. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship. 
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia. 
  Since either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, and Kayne is already assigned, Novetzke cannot be assigned. 
  Therefore, the only possible assignment for the other two ambassadors are Jaramillo and Landon. 
  Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Jaramillo must also be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. In this case, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Therefore, the remaining ambassadorship would be assigned to Novetzke. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Landon must also be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. In this case, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, the remaining ambassadorship would be assigned to Novetzke.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, if Kayne is assigned to Venezuela, then Jaramillo must be assigned to one of the other two countries, and Landon must be assigned to Zambia. If Novetzke is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must be assigned to the other country, and Landon must be assigned to Zambia. Therefore, the possible combinations are:
  1. Jaramillo and Landon
  2. Jaramillo and Novetzke
  3. Kayne and Landon
  4. Kayne and Novetzke
  5. Landon and Novetzke
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which means that Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. Also, if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, which means that Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia (in some order). Since Landon is assigned to Zambia, Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen. Therefore, the answer is (B) Jaramillo and Novetzke.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Jaramillo must also be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. In this case, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Landon must also be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. In this case, either Jaramillo or Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, the possible combinations of ambassadors assigned are:
  - Jaramillo and Landon (if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela)
  - Jaramillo and Novetzke (if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia)
  - Kayne and Landon (if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia)
  - Kayne and Novetzke (if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela)
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one of the countries, then Kayne is also assigned as ambassador to one of the countries.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("A") 
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Thus, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia or Venezuela. If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one of the countries, then Kayne must also be assigned as ambassador to one of the countries. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to either Yemen or Zambia. Since Landon is assigned to Zambia, Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, the possible assignments are Jaramillo and Landon to Yemen and Zambia, respectively, and Kayne to Venezuela. Thus, the answer is A.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  Since Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. Landon is assigned to Zambia. Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen. This means that Kayne is assigned to Venezuela. Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned are Kayne and Landon.

The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:

  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1, no breed can be featured on day 2.
- Since no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2 or day 4.
- Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, they can be featured on day 3, day 5, and day 6.
- Since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 3, day 5, or day 6.
- Since any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
- Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6. 
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and cannot be featured on day 2.
- Himalayans are not featured on day 1 and can be featured on day 3, day 5, and day 6.
- Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, so they cannot be featured on day 3, day 5, or day 6.
- No breed can be featured on day 7 since any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly seven consecutive days.
  - There are three breeds of kittens: Himalayan, Manx, and Siamese.
  - There are three breeds of puppies: Greyhound, Newfoundland, and Rottweiler.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Solution:
- According to the conditions, Greyhounds are featured on day 1, and any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. So, Greyhounds are not featured on day 7.
- Also, Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. So, Himalayans are featured on days 2, 3, and 4 or days 3, 4, and 5 or days 4, 5, and 6.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. So, Rottweilers are featured on days 2 and 4 or days 3 and 5 or days 5 and 6.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. So, we can determine the possible breeds featured on each day.

  Day 1: Greyhound
  Day 2: Siamese and Rottweiler or Siamese and Himalayan
  Day 3: Manx and Newfoundland or Manx and Rottweiler or Manx and Himalayan
  Day 4: Himalayan and Newfoundland or Himalayan and Rottweiler or Himalayan and Siamese
  Day 5: Rottweiler and Manx or Rottweiler and Himalayan or Rottweiler and Newfoundland
  Day 6: Newfoundland and Siamese or Newfoundland and Manx or Newfoundland and Himalayan
  Day 7: None of the breeds featured on day 1 (Greyhound)

- Now, we can check each option to see which one could be true.
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2. This is possible according to the above schedule. So, the answer is A.
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7. This is not possible because any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4. This is possible according to the above schedule. So, the answer is C.
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5. This is possible according to the above schedule. So, the answer is D.
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6. This is possible according to the above schedule. So, the answer is E.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 through day 7).
  - There are exactly three breeds of kittens (Himalayan, Manx, Siamese).
  - There are exactly three breeds of puppies (Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler).
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.

  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Solution:
  - Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 2. Therefore, option A is false.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Therefore, option B is false.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, Himalayans can be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 or on days 5, 6, and 7. However, Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4. Therefore, option C is false.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers can be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 or on days 5 and 6. However, Manx cannot be featured on day 4 (because it would be consecutive with day 3). Therefore, option D is false.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, Newfoundlands and Manx cannot be featured on day 6. Therefore, option E is false.

A: Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so no breed can be featured on day 2. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
B: Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
C: Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Since Himalayans are not featured on day 1, they must be featured on days 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4. However, Rottweilers can be featured on day 3. Therefore, this choice is possible.
D: Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, Rottweilers can be featured on days 2, 5, 6, and 7. Therefore, this choice is possible.
E: No breed can be featured on day 5 because it is the day after day 4, which must feature Himalayans. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, so they cannot be featured on day 4.

Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation:

  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.

  - If Himalayans are featured on day 2, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 3 or day 4. Therefore, Rottweilers can only be featured on day 5 or day 6. However, this means that Himalayans will be featured on day 7, which violates the given condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2.
  - If Himalayans are featured on day 3, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4 or day 5. Therefore, Rottweilers can only be featured on day 6. This means that Himalayans will be featured on day 4, day 5, or day 6. However, if Himalayans are featured on day 6, then Newfoundlands and Manx cannot be featured on day 5 or day 7. Therefore, Himalayans cannot be featured on day 6. This means that Himalayans must be featured on day 4 or day 5.
  - If Himalayans are featured on day 4, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5. Therefore, Rottweilers must be featured on day 6 and Manx must be featured on day 5. This means that Siamese must be featured on day 2 and Newfoundland must be featured on day 7.
  - If Himalayans are featured on day 5, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4. Therefore, Rottweilers must be featured on day 6 and Newfoundland must be featured on day 4. This means that Siamese must be featured on day 2 and Manx must be featured on day 7.

  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers can be featured on days 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  - Using the same reasoning, we can determine that Siamese can be featured on days 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7; Manx can be featured on days 2, 4, 6, or 7; and Newfoundland can be featured on days 2, 3, 4, or 7.

Action: 
  - To check which option could be true, we need to verify if it satisfies all the given conditions.
  - A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2. This is not possible since no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
  - B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7. This is not possible since any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4. This is possible since Himalayans can be featured on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 and Rottweilers can be featured on days 2, 3, 5, or 6. This option satisfies all the given conditions.
  - D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5. This is not possible since no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.

- Since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, and Himalayans are featured on days 2-4 or days 3-5 or days 4-6, Rottweilers must be featured on days 1-3 or days 5-7. Since Manx cannot be featured on day 4, they must be featured on days 2-4 or days 5-7. Therefore, choice D is possible.

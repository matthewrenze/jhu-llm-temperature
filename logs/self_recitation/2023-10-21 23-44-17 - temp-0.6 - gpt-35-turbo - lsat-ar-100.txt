### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  5. Exactly three of the students review Undulation.
  
  A: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane and Sunset. Therefore, Megregian must review Undulation since he reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. This option is not possible.
  B: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane and Sunset. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they cannot both review Sunset, so one of them must review Undulation. Therefore, O'Neill could review Undulation. This option is possible.
  C: If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Megregian nor Lopez can review Undulation, violating condition 2. This option is not possible.
  D: If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer and O'Neill cannot both review Tamerlane, violating condition 3. This option is not possible.
  E: If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer must review Undulation and Tamerlane, violating condition 4. This option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  They review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review a play that is not Undulation. 
  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot be part of the three students who review Undulation.
  We also know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot be one of the three students who review Undulation.
  Therefore, the three students who review Undulation must be any three of the following: Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  
Analysis:
  A: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and Megregian does not review Undulation, then Megregian is not one of the three students who review Undulation. This contradicts the given information, so this cannot be true.
  B: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and O'Neill does not review Undulation, then O'Neill is not one of the three students who review Undulation. This is possible, so this could be true.
  C: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and Jiang reviews Undulation, then Jiang is one of the three students who review Undulation. This is not possible, since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  D: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill must be the three students who review Undulation. This is possible, so this could be true.
  E: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and O'Neill reviews Sunset, then O'Neill is not one of the three students who review Undulation. This contradicts the given information, so this cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  5 students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez < Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then at most one student can review both Sunset and Tamerlane.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then at most one student can review both Tamerlane and Undulation.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then at most one student can review both Sunset and Undulation.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review either Sunset or Tamerlane or both.
  If Megregian is one of the students who reviews Undulation, then he must review at least one of the other two plays. This means that either Kramer or Lopez must review only one play, and the other must review both Sunset and Tamerlane. However, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews, and we do not know which plays Jiang reviews. This means that Megregian cannot be one of the students who reviews Undulation. Therefore, we can eliminate choice A.
  O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, so he cannot be one of the students who reviews only Undulation. This means that either Kramer or Lopez must review only one play, and the other must review both Sunset and Tamerlane. We do not know which plays Jiang reviews, so it is possible that Jiang reviews Undulation and Sunset. In this case, Kramer and Lopez would both review only Undulation, and O'Neill would review Tamerlane and Undulation. Therefore, O'Neill could be one of the students who reviews Undulation. This means we cannot eliminate choice B.
  We do not know which plays Jiang reviews, so it is possible that Jiang reviews Undulation. Therefore, we cannot eliminate choice C.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then no more than two students can review Tamerlane. Therefore, we can eliminate choice D.
  We do not know which plays O'Neill reviews, so it is possible that O'Neill reviews Sunset. Therefore, we cannot eliminate choice E.
  
Action: Answer("BC")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Five students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review one or more of exactly three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

To solve the problem, let's try to identify what we can infer from the given information:
- If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane, Sunset, or both.
- If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be Kramer or O'Neill.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation.
- If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez must review Tamerlane, Sunset, or both. However, if they both review Sunset, then there will be three students reviewing Sunset, which is not possible. Therefore, Megregian must review Tamerlane.
- If Megregian reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer and Lopez must review Sunset, Undulation, or both. However, if they both review Undulation, then there will be four students reviewing Undulation, which is not possible. Therefore, Kramer and Lopez must review Sunset.
- If Kramer and Lopez both review Sunset, then O'Neill must review Tamerlane and not review Undulation.
- If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then A, C, and E are not possible.
- If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian cannot review Tamerlane, which is not possible. Therefore, D is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must have reviewed Tamerlane. Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Undulation, while the remaining two students, who reviewed Tamerlane, must have reviewed the same play or plays as each other. 

A: Megregian must have reviewed Undulation, so this statement is false.
B: O'Neill reviewed Undulation, so this statement is false.
C: Jiang did not review Tamerlane, so this statement is true.
D: Lopez reviewed fewer plays than Megregian, so Lopez did not review Tamerlane. This statement is false.
E: O'Neill reviewed Undulation, so this statement is false.

Therefore, the answer is C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Five students - Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill - review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, there is only one student who does not review any of the three plays.
  Therefore, only one of the students can review only one play.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review either Sunset or Tamerlane.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez review Sunset and Tamerlane, which means O'Neill reviews Tamerlane and Undulation. This violates the condition that only two students can review the same play or plays.
  If O'Neill reviews Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez review Sunset and Tamerlane, which means Megregian reviews Tamerlane and Undulation. This violates the condition that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  If Kramer reviews Undulation, then Lopez and O'Neill review Sunset and Tamerlane, which means Megregian reviews Tamerlane and Undulation. This satisfies all the conditions.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Five students (J, K, L, M, O) review one or more of exactly three plays (S, T, U), but do not review any other plays.
  - K and L each review fewer of the plays than M.
  - Neither L nor M reviews any play J reviews.
  - K and O both review T.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - If exactly three of the students review U, then the other two students must review T.
  
Analysis: 
  - If exactly three of the students review U, then the other two students must review T.
  - K and O both review T, so the third student who reviews T must be one of J, L, or M.
  - Neither L nor M reviews any play that J reviews, so J reviews either S or T.
  - If J reviews T, then K, L, and M must review U, which means O does not review U (contradicting the given statement).
  - Therefore, J reviews S, and K, L, and M review U. 
  - This means that O reviews T and is the only one who reviews T.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three of the students review Undulation and no other play.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, only one more person can review Tamerlane. Hence, no one else besides Kramer and O'Neill can review Tamerlane.
  - Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, the remaining two students must review the same play.
  - Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews and Megregian already reviews Tamerlane, it is impossible for Jiang to review Tamerlane. This means the only play Jiang can review is Undulation.
  - Now, since exactly three of the students review Undulation, the remaining two students must review Sunset.
  - Also, since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, they cannot review Undulation. Hence, Megregian must be the one reviewing Undulation.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  5 students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill review 1 or more of exactly 3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly 2 of the students review exactly the same play/plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the two remaining students must review the same play/plays as each other.
  Therefore, the two remaining students cannot review Tamerlane, since Kramer and O'Neill already review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the two remaining students must review Sunset.
  
  A: If exactly 3 students review Undulation, and the two remaining students review Sunset, then Megregian must review Undulation.
  B: If exactly 3 students review Undulation, and the two remaining students review Sunset, then O'Neill must review Tamerlane (not Undulation).
  C: If exactly 3 students review Undulation, then Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  D: If exactly 3 students review Undulation, then Lopez cannot review Tamerlane.
  E: If exactly 3 students review Undulation, and the two remaining students review Sunset, then O'Neill cannot review Sunset.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  5 students - Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill
  3 plays - Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation
  Kramer and Lopez < Megregian
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot be the three students who review Undulation. Therefore, Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian must be the three students who review Undulation. Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews, then Jiang cannot review Undulation. Thus, we can eliminate choice C. The question asks which one of the following could be true, so we need to find the answer choice that is possible. 

Solution:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the other three students must review Undulation. Therefore, O'Neill cannot review Undulation. Thus, we can eliminate choice B. 

  Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews, and Jiang does not review Undulation, then it is possible that Jiang reviews Sunset or Tamerlane. Thus, we cannot eliminate choice A. 

  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot review Sunset. The other three students review Undulation, so they cannot review Sunset or Tamerlane. Therefore, it is not possible that O'Neill reviews Sunset. Thus, we can eliminate choice E. 

  We are left with choice D, which states that Lopez reviews Tamerlane. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, then it is possible that Kramer also reviews Tamerlane. Megregian must review Undulation, since he/she reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. Therefore, the answer is D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Two service targets are set for each client.
  - There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - The service targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    * None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    * Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    * Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
  - Since there are only three clients, and two targets are set for each client, there are only six targets in total.
  - According to the conditions, the following targets are not possible:
    * None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This means that if a client's voicemail target is 1 day, then its website target cannot be longer than 1 day.
    * Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. This means that Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days, and the other clients' voicemail targets cannot be 1 day.
    * Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This means that if Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target cannot be 1 day.

Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, the target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients is a 2-day voicemail target.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The company needs to set six targets for three clients (Image, Solide, and Truvest).
  Two targets are set per client (one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail).
  The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The maintenance company has three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company sets two targets for each client, one for requests received through the website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  The company sets targets of 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: A 3-day voicemail target cannot be set for more than one client because if more than one client has a 3-day voicemail target, then Image's voicemail target would be longer than its voicemail target, which violates one of the conditions. All of the other targets can be set for more than one client while still satisfying all of the conditions.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest. 
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

A: a 1-day website target can be set for all three clients, since none of them can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
B: a 2-day voicemail target can be set for more than one of the clients, since there is no restriction on the voicemail targets.
C: a 2-day website target cannot be set for both Solide and Truvest, since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
D: a 3-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients, since there is no restriction on the voicemail targets.
E: a 3-day website target can be set for both Solide and Truvest, since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("C")

  The targets are 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.
  There are six targets in total, two for each client.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  
  A: A 1-day website target can be set for multiple clients, as long as it does not violate any of the conditions.
  B: A 2-day voicemail target can be set for multiple clients, as long as it does not violate any of the conditions.
  C: A 2-day website target can be set for multiple clients, as long as it does not violate any of the conditions.
  D: A 3-day voicemail target can be set for multiple clients, as long as it does not violate any of the conditions.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  There are six targets: two for each client.
  The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  None of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If the company sets a 2-day voicemail target for one client, it cannot set the same target for any other client, as it would violate the condition that none of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target. Any website target must be longer than the corresponding voicemail target. Therefore, B is the correct answer.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company sets two service targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The targets are set according to the following conditions:
  1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

A: a 1-day website target can be set for all three clients.
B: a 2-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients.
C: a 2-day website target can be set for two clients, but not all three. For example, Solide and Truvest can have a 2-day website target, but Image cannot have a 2-day website target because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
D: a 3-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients.
E: a 3-day website target can be set for all three clients.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  The company sets two service targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The targets are set according to the following conditions:
    1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If we look at the conditions given, we can see that there are no restrictions on a 2-day voicemail target. However, there are restrictions on the other targets. For example, a 1-day website target cannot be set for Image because it would violate the first condition. Similarly, a 3-day voicemail target cannot be set for Solide because it would violate the third condition. Finally, a 2-day website target cannot be set for Truvest because it would violate the third condition. Therefore, the only target that can be set for more than one client is a 2-day voicemail target.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  Two service targets are set for each client, one for requests through the website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Three companies are trading buildings with each other.
  - Each building is categorized as class 1, class 2 or class 3.
  - RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3)
  - Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2)
  - Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  - One trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
      - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
      - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
      - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Solution: 
  From the given information, we can see that there is only one class 1 building, one class 2 building owned by Southco and three class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp. Therefore, the only possible trade that can happen is between RealProp and Southco, and RealProp can only trade Garza Tower (class 1) for Flores Tower (class 1) or Lynch Building (class 2). 
  If RealProp trades Garza Tower (class 1) for Flores Tower (class 1), then Southco will own both class 1 buildings, which means that the other two trades cannot happen. Therefore, the only possible trade is Garza Tower (class 1) for Lynch Building (class 2). 
  After this trade, the final ownership of the buildings will be:
  RealProp: Yates House (class 3), Zimmer House (class 3), Lynch Building (class 2)
  Southco: Flores Tower (class 1)
  Trustcorp: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), Ortiz Building (class 2)
  Therefore, the answer is (C) RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  To make only one trade, there must be one building from each company involved in the trade.
  The trade must be of one of the three kinds mentioned above.
  There are only two class 1 buildings, the Garza Tower and the Flores Tower, so only those two buildings can be traded for each other.
  If the Garza Tower is traded, then either two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings must be traded for it, but there is only one other class 1 building to trade for two class 2 buildings.
  If the Flores Tower is traded, then two class 2 buildings must be traded for it. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
  - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
  - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
  - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  To be able to trade, the buildings owned by the companies must have the same class or follow the trading rules.
  RealProp can only trade the Garza Tower for another class 1 building or trade it for two class 2 buildings. The Yates House and the Zimmer House can only be traded for two class 3 buildings each.
  Southco can only trade the Flores Tower for another class 1 building or trade it for two class 2 buildings. The Lynch Building can only be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp can only trade any of their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.

  Option A: RealProp would need to trade the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower and RealProp would not be able to trade the Yates House and the Zimmer House since they are not class 1 buildings. Trustcorp would not be able to trade any of their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings. Incorrect.
  Option B: RealProp would need to trade the Garza Tower for the King Building and the Ortiz Building and Trustcorp would need to trade the Ortiz Building for the Yates House and the Zimmer House. Southco would not be able to trade the Lynch Building since it is not a class 1 building. Incorrect.
  Option C: RealProp would need to trade the Garza Tower for the Lynch Building and Southco would need to trade the Flores Tower for the Yates House and the Zimmer House. Trustcorp would not be able to trade any of their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings. Incorrect.
  Option D: RealProp would need to trade the Garza Tower for the Meyer Building and the Yates House for two class 3 buildings. Trustcorp would need to trade the Ortiz Building for the Zimmer House and the King Building for two class 3 buildings. Southco would not be able to trade the Lynch Building since it is not a class 1 building. Incorrect.
  Option E: RealProp would need to trade the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower and the Yates House and the Zimmer House for two class 3 buildings each. Southco would need to trade the Lynch Building for the Ortiz Building and Trustcorp would need to trade the Meyer Building for the King Building. This configuration satisfies all the trading rules. Correct.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  We can start by looking at the buildings that cannot be traded for each other, for example, the class 1 buildings cannot be traded for the class 3 buildings. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and C. 
  Option D is not possible because there is only one class 1 building, but two class 2 buildings cannot be traded for it. 
  Option B is not possible because there are no trades in which a class 1 building can be exchanged for a class 2 building.
  Option E is the only possible combination that satisfies all the trading rules.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  The three possible trades are: 
    1) Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    2) Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    3) Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis: 
  RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower for any building because there is no other class 1 building available for trade. 
  Option A cannot be true because RealProp cannot trade Garza Tower for Flores Tower since they are not of the same class. 
  Option B cannot be true because RealProp cannot trade King Building or Ortiz Building since they are both class 2 buildings and RealProp does not own any class 1 building to trade for them. 
  Option C is possible because RealProp can trade Garza Tower (class 1) for Flores Tower (class 1) and Southco can trade Lynch Building (class 2) for Zimmer House (class 3) and Yates House (class 3). Trustcorp keeps their buildings. 
  Option D cannot be true because RealProp cannot trade Meyer Building or Yates House since they are both class 3 buildings and RealProp does not own any class 2 building to trade for them. 
  Option E cannot be true because RealProp cannot trade Garza Tower for Yates House and Zimmer House since they are not of the same class. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns 3 buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  The possible trades are:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After the trade, each company should still own the same number of buildings as before.
  
Analysis:
  Option A is not possible because RealProp would have two class 1 buildings after the trade.
  Option B is not possible because Trustcorp would have two class 3 buildings after the trade.
  Option C is possible if RealProp trades the Garza Tower for the Lynch Building, Southco trades the Flores Tower for the Yates House and the Zimmer House, and Trustcorp trades the King Building for the Garza Tower.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp would have two class 2 buildings after the trade.
  Option E is not possible because RealProp would have two class 3 buildings after the trade.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Solution:
  We need to find a combination of trades that satisfies the constraints mentioned in the question.
  RealProp has one Class 1 building and two Class 3 buildings. The only possible trade involving a Class 1 building is Trade 2, which involves trading one Class 1 building for two Class 2 buildings.
  Southco has one Class 1 building and one Class 2 building. The only possible trade involving a Class 2 building is Trade 3, which involves trading one Class 2 building for two Class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp has three Class 2 buildings. The only possible trade involving a Class 2 building is Trade 1, which involves trading one building for one other building of the same class.
  Therefore, the only possible trades are:
    Trade 1: Trustcorp trades the King Building for the Meyer Building
    Trade 2: RealProp trades the Garza Tower for the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building
    Trade 3: Southco trades the Lynch Building for the Yates House and the Zimmer House
  After these trades, the companies will own the following buildings:
    RealProp: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
    Southco: the Flores Tower
    Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  Answer: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  Trades can only be made between buildings of the same class or between a class 1 building and two class 2 buildings or between a class 2 building and two class 3 buildings.

Elimination:
  A: RealProp's Garza Tower is class 1, but Southco does not have a class 2 building to trade for it.
  B: RealProp is trading a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, but there is no class 2 building available to trade with Southco.
  C: RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings, but it is not possible to trade a class 1 building for a class 3 building.
  D: RealProp is trading a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, but there is no class 2 building available to trade with Southco.
  E: RealProp's Garza Tower is class 1, but Trustcorp does not have two class 2 buildings to trade for it.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  - Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  - Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  - Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Solution:
  - We need to make only one trade.
  - We can't trade a class 1 building for a class 3 building.
  - We can't trade a class 3 building for two class 2 buildings.
  - We can't trade a class 1 building for two class 3 buildings.
  - So, the only possible trade is trading a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  - Trustcorp has all the class 2 buildings. So, Trustcorp needs to trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  - RealProp has two class 3 buildings, and Southco has one class 2 building. So, they can trade to complete the transaction.
  - Therefore, the possible trade is: Trustcorp trades the Ortiz Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  - After the trade, the buildings owned by the companies would be:
    - RealProp: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3)
    - Southco: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2)
    - Trustcorp: King Building (class 2) and Meyer Building (class 2)
  - The only option that matches the above configuration is option E.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The mystery novel consists of seven chapters and each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in either chapter 2, 4, 5, or 6.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, so if T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5; and if T is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: Based on the constraints, if U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4. T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in either chapter 2, 4, 5, or 6. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, if T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and R must be mentioned in chapter 1 or 7. If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 6, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7. If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5, and S must be mentioned in chapter 6. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that R is mentioned in chapter 5. So, Answer("B").
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then:
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  - W must be mentioned after T, with exactly two chapters in between, so W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.

Checking the options:
  A: If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or later, violating the constraint. Eliminate A.
  B: If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, violating the constraint. Eliminate B.
  C: If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, violating the constraint. Eliminate C.
  D: If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, violating the constraint. Eliminate D.
  E: If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7, violating the constraint. Eliminate E.

Therefore, none of the options is possible given that U is mentioned in chapter 3. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are seven clues that must be mentioned exactly once, one per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating the two.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  
Analysis:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, since that would mean W and X are in adjacent chapters.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, which means it can only be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if S is mentioned in chapter 1, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later, which means T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or earlier, violating the constraint that T must be mentioned before W with exactly two chapters separating them.
  Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each of the seven clues is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to certain constraints:
    - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
    - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
    - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    
Working through the constraints:
- U is mentioned in chapter 3, so X must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4 (due to the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters).
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, or 4 (due to the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W).
- If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5 (due to the constraint that T must be mentioned before W). But this would mean that X is mentioned in chapter 6 (since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters), which violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7 (due to the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W). But this would mean that X is mentioned in chapter 6 (since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters), which violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 6 (due to the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W). This also means that X must be mentioned in chapter 4 (since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters).

Analysis:
- U is mentioned in chapter 3.
- X is mentioned in chapter 4.
- W is mentioned in chapter 6.
- Therefore, R and S must be mentioned in chapters 1 and 2 (in some order), and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
- This means that the only valid option is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Solution:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or chapter 5.
  - W must be mentioned after T, so it can only be in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be in chapter 6 and Z cannot be in chapter 5.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W cannot be in chapter 5.
  - Therefore, the only possibility is that W is mentioned in chapter 6, which means that T is mentioned in chapter 2 and X is mentioned in chapter 4.
  - This leaves R and S to be mentioned in chapter 1 and chapter 5, but their order is not determined.
  
Action: Answer("B") - R is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  There are 7 chapters in the novel, numbered 1 through 7.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4. 
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3. 
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  This leaves S to be mentioned in chapter 4, and R to be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 5.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  This leaves S to be mentioned in chapter 5, and R to be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 4.
  Therefore, R could be mentioned in chapter 5.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - 7 clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: 
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4. This is because U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, we can eliminate choices A, B, C, and D because they do not have X mentioned in chapter 4.

  Therefore, the answer is E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is used exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then:
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  - W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  
  Based on these constraints, we can eliminate choices A, B, and C. 
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6 is possible, as T can be in chapter 2, U in chapter 3, X in chapter 4, S in chapter 5, Z in chapter 7, and W in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4 is not possible, as U is in chapter 3, and U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3:
  - T cannot be in chapter 1, so it must be in chapter 2 or 4.
  - U is in chapter 3, so X must be in chapter 4 or 2.
  - W cannot be in chapter 1 or 2, so it must be in chapter 5 or 7.
  - Since there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T cannot be in chapter 2 (otherwise W would have to be in chapter 4, which would violate the constraint), so T must be in chapter 4.
  - Since S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, neither S nor Z can be in chapter 2 or 4.
  - Since W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters, X cannot be in chapter 2.
  - Therefore, X must be in chapter 4 and W must be in chapter 7.
  - This leaves R to be in chapter 1 and S to be in chapter 5.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each chapter from 1 to 7 must have a different clue.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1.
  - T must be before W, with two chapters separating them.
  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then the clues that will be in chapters 2 and 4 are not W and X, but we don't know which clues they are.
  - T must be mentioned before W, with two chapters in between. This means T cannot be in chapter 2 or 4, so it must be in chapter 3 or earlier.
  - Therefore, T cannot be in chapter 4, so it must be in chapter 3 or earlier. 
  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters. Therefore, neither S nor Z can be in chapter 6 if T and W are in chapters 3 and 7.
  - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be in chapter 4 if T and X are in chapters 3 and 5.
  
Action: 
  - Based on the analysis, the only option that could be true is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6. So, Answer("D").

The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 0:

  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
- From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- From condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review the same play.
- From condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so neither of them can be the third person to review Tamerlane.
- From condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Since we know Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, the only person left who could review Tamerlane is Megregian.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Using condition 1, we know Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, options A and E are incorrect. 

Using condition 3, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, option C is incorrect since it has three students that review Tamerlane.

Using condition 4, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be the two students who review Tamerlane since they are the only two that have not been excluded by the other conditions. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.

Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.
  From condition 4, we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
  From condition 3, we know that at least two students reviewed the same play.
  From condition 2, we know that Lopez and Megregian did not review any play that Jiang reviewed.

  The only option that satisfies all of these conditions is option B: Kramer and O'Neill. Therefore, the answer is: Answer("B").
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
  From condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the correct answer must include exactly two students who review Tamerlane.
  From condition 2, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  From condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must review Tamerlane since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. 
  
Solution:
  The only answer that includes exactly two students who review Tamerlane and satisfies all given conditions is D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill.
  Therefore, Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Five students are Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.

We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so either of them must be in the answer. However, as two students must review the same play or plays, the answer must have at least two students. 

Option A cannot be correct, since Jiang does not review any play that Lopez or Megregian reviews, so Jiang cannot review Tamerlane if Megregian reviews it.

Option B has Kramer and O'Neill, both of whom review Tamerlane, so this option is possible.

Option C has Kramer and O'Neill, both of whom review Tamerlane, but it also includes Lopez, who may not review Tamerlane. So, this option is not possible.

Option D has Kramer and O'Neill, both of whom review Tamerlane, and Megregian, who does not review any play that Jiang reviews. So, this option is possible.

Option E has Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill, but Kramer, who also reviews Tamerlane, is not included. So, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using the first and second pieces of knowledge, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian review Tamerlane. Using the third piece of knowledge, we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. Thus, Megregian cannot review only Tamerlane, since that would mean Kramer and Lopez review no plays, which is not possible. Therefore, the only possibility is that Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Each student reviews one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
Action: From the given conditions, we can determine that the only two students that review Tamerlane are Kramer and O'Neill. Therefore, the answer is Choice (B): Kramer, O'Neill.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, any answer choice that does not include Kramer and O'Neill cannot be correct. 

Using condition 3, we know that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other. Since we already know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, there can only be one more student who reviews Tamerlane. 

Using condition 4, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. Since Kramer and O'Neill already review Tamerlane, neither of them can be the third student to review Tamerlane. Therefore, the third student must be either Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian. 

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews. Since we need one of these students to review Tamerlane, Jiang cannot be the third student to review Tamerlane. 

Therefore, the only possible answer choice is C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using Condition 1, we can eliminate options (A), (C), and (D) since they do not include O'Neill. 

Using Condition 4, options (B) and (E) are not valid since they only have one student reviewing Tamerlane. 

Using Condition 2, we can eliminate option (A) since Jiang is reviewing a play which is not Tamerlane.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Kramer and O'Neill.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using the given information, we can deduce that only Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane. 
Option A and E both include Jiang, who does not review any play reviewed by Lopez or Megregian. Option B only includes Kramer and O'Neill, which is correct. Option C includes Lopez, who reviews fewer plays than Megregian. Option D includes Megregian, who reviews more plays than both Kramer and Lopez. Therefore, the answer is B.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Question: The organizer must at least select
Choices:
  A: one French novel and one French play
  B: one French novel and one Russian play
  C: one Russian novel and one French play
  D: two French novels
  E: two Russian novels
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The organizer must select at least 5 works and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works.
  The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
  No more than 4 French works are selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Since there must be at least 3 but no more than 4 novels selected, we know that the organizer must select either 3 or 4 novels. Since there are 6 possible novels to select (3 French and 3 Russian), the organizer must select at least one French novel and one Russian novel. 

If the organizer selects both French plays, then the Russian play cannot be selected. Therefore, the organizer cannot select both French plays. 

If the organizer selects 4 novels, then there must be 2 French novels and 2 Russian novels, since the organizer must select at least as many French novels as Russian novels. Since no more than 4 French works can be selected, the organizer cannot select any French plays. Therefore, the organizer must select 2 French novels and 2 Russian novels.

If the organizer selects 3 novels, then there must be at least 1 French novel and 1 Russian novel. If the organizer selects 1 French novel, then the organizer can select at most 3 French works (1 French novel and 2 French plays). This means that the organizer must select at least 2 Russian novels. The organizer cannot select both French plays, since the Russian play cannot be selected if both French plays are selected. Therefore, the organizer must select one French novel and one French play, and at least two Russian novels.

Action: Answer("A") - The organizer must at least select one French novel and one French play.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The organizer must select at least 5 and at most 6 works from 9 works.
  The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays and 1 Russian play.
  No more than 4 French works are selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
  
Analysis:
  To satisfy the condition of "At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.", the organizer must select at least 2 French novels.
  If the organizer selects both French plays, then the Russian play cannot be selected. So, at most one French play can be selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected. So, the organizer must select 3 or 4 novels.
  If the organizer selects 4 novels, then at most 1 French work can be selected which contradicts the condition "No more than 4 French works are selected."
  Therefore, the organizer must select 3 novels. At least 2 of them must be French novels to satisfy the condition of "At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected."
  So, the organizer can select at most one French play and at least one Russian play to satisfy the condition of selecting at least 5 works.

Action: Answer("B") - one French novel and one Russian play.

- At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Analysis:
- We need to find the minimum number of works that the organizer must select.

- At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected, so the organizer must select at least 2 French novels and 1 Russian novel.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, so the organizer cannot select both French plays.
- No more than 4 French works are selected, so the organizer can select at most 2 French plays and 2 French novels.

Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, the organizer must select at least two French novels to satisfy the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels, and selecting two French novels does not exceed the maximum limit of selecting four French works.
Response 3:

  The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play.
  No more than four French works are selected.
  At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

To satisfy the conditions, the organizer must select at least three novels, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

- At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected. There are a total of 6 novels (3 French and 3 Russian) and 3 non-novels (2 French plays and 1 Russian play). So, the organizer must select at least 3 novels and at most 4 novels.
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. So, if the organizer selects 3 novels, then 2 of them must be French novels and 1 of them must be a Russian novel. If the organizer selects 4 novels, then 2 or 3 of them must be French novels and 1 or 2 of them must be Russian novels.
- No more than 4 French works are selected. So, if the organizer selects 6 works, then at most 3 of them can be French works. If the organizer selects 5 works, then at most 2 of them can be French works.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?

  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
  - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
  - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
  - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to find the option that violates the rules, no matter how many trades are made.
  
Analysis:
  A: RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1). This statement could be true, but it cannot own Flores Tower (class 1), which is owned by Southco. So, this statement cannot be true.
  B: Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2). This statement could be true. 
  C: Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1), so it cannot own Garza Tower (class 1), which is owned by RealProp. So, this statement cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp does not own Flores Tower (class 1), which is owned by Southco. So, this statement cannot be true.
  E: Trustcorp does not own Garza Tower (class 1), which is owned by RealProp. So, this statement cannot be true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  A: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco and is a class 1 building, so it cannot be owned by RealProp.
  B: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco and is a class 1 building, so it cannot be owned by Trustcorp. The Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp and is a class 2 building, so it cannot be owned by RealProp.
  C: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and is a class 1 building, so it cannot be owned by Southco. The Lynch Building is owned by Southco and is a class 2 building, so it cannot be owned by RealProp.
  D: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco and is a class 1 building, so it cannot be owned by Trustcorp. The Ortiz Building is owned by Trustcorp and is a class 2 building, so it cannot be owned by RealProp.
  E: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and is a class 1 building, so it cannot be owned by Trustcorp. The Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp and is a class 2 building, so it cannot be owned by Southco.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to determine which option is not possible, regardless of the trades made.
  
Analysis:
  A: RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is class 1. However, Southco owns the Flores Tower, which is also class 1. This means that the buildings owned by RealProp cannot be the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower at the same time, so option A is not possible.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower, which is class 1, and the Meyer Building, which is class 2. It is possible for Southco to trade the Flores Tower for two class 3 buildings, and then trade one of those class 3 buildings for the Meyer Building. Therefore, option B is possible.
  C: Southco owns the Garza Tower, which is class 1, and the Lynch Building, which is class 2. It is not possible for Southco to trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings, since the Garza Tower is class 1. Therefore, option C is not possible.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building, which is class 2, and the Ortiz Building, which is also class 2. Therefore, the buildings owned by Trustcorp cannot be the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building at the same time, so option D is not possible.
  E: Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower, which is class 1, so it is not possible for the buildings owned by Trustcorp to be the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building at the same time. Therefore, option E is not possible.

    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

A: It is not possible for RealProp to own the Flores Tower because it is owned by Southco, and it is a class 1 building, which means it cannot be traded for two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2), and Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, which is a class 2 building. Therefore, B can be true.
C: Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2), and Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, which is a class 1 building. Therefore, C can be true.
D: Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building, which is a class 2 building, and Ortiz Building, which is also a class 2 building. Therefore, D can be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The hearing takes place on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of one week.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, it means they will both testify on either Monday or Tuesday, since Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Garcia cannot testify on Monday or Tuesday since Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. This means Garcia must testify on Wednesday. There are only two witnesses remaining who can testify on Tuesday: Hong and Jackson. However, since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday and Hong cannot testify on Monday, it means Hong must testify on Tuesday and Jackson must testify on Monday. Therefore, Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing takes exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.

Analysis:
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. If Franco does not testify on Monday, then he must testify on either Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Hong cannot testify on Tuesday because exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday and Hong does not testify on the same day as Franco. Therefore, Franco must testify on Wednesday, and Hong must testify on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday.

Analysis:
- If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Hong cannot testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco cannot testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday, and Garcia must testify on Tuesday. This satisfies all of the conditions of the schedule.
- If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Iturbe must testify on Tuesday, and Hong must testify on Tuesday. Franco cannot testify on Tuesday, so he must testify on Monday. This leaves Garcia to testify on Wednesday. However, this violates the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- If Franco testifies on Monday, this violates the condition that at least one witness testifies on Monday.

Conclusion: 
The only possible schedule that satisfies the conditions and has Franco testifying on the same day as Hong is that Franco testifies on Tuesday, Hong testifies on Wednesday, and Garcia testifies on Monday. This means that Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday, so the answer is (B) Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing takes exactly three days of one week: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which would violate the condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday.
  
  A: Franco must testify on Tuesday, so he cannot testify on Wednesday. Incorrect.
  B: Franco must testify on Tuesday, so he cannot testify on Monday. Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday. Incorrect.
  C: Franco must testify on Tuesday, so he cannot testify on Wednesday. Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday. Incorrect.
  D: Franco and Hong testify on Tuesday. Incorrect.
  E: Franco testifies on Tuesday, and Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Correct.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  2. The hearing takes place over three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  3. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  4. Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  5. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  6. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  7. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  8. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday since Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday since Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday if he is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing takes exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia must testify on Monday, which violates the condition that Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, Franco must testify on Wednesday. Iturbe also testifies on Wednesday, so the only witness left to testify on Tuesday is Jackson. Hong cannot testify on Monday, so she must testify on Tuesday, and Garcia must testify on Monday.

Action: Answer("C") Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. The hearing takes exactly three days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.

  4. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  5. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  6. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  7. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday, and Hong cannot testify on Monday or Wednesday. From condition 4, we know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Hong must testify on Tuesday. From condition 5, we know that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Franco and Garcia must testify on Monday and Wednesday. From condition 3, we know that Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, so Garcia must testify on Monday and Franco must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday. Then, the witness scheduled to testify on Monday must be Garcia or Jackson. Since Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco, then Jackson must testify on Monday. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Hong and Garcia must testify on Tuesday. Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday and Hong and Garcia testify on Tuesday, Franco must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Five witnesses (Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson) are scheduled to testify on a hearing that takes three days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco doesn't testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong doesn't testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.

Since Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, if Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. But, we know that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Hong must testify on Wednesday. 

Knowing that Hong testifies on Wednesday and Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, we can conclude that only one witness testifies on Monday and two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday, and Franco must testify on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must both be scheduled on either Tuesday or Wednesday. This means that Garcia must be scheduled on Monday.
  
  A: Franco testifies on Wednesday, but this is not necessarily true.
  B: Garcia must be scheduled on Monday, so this is true.
  C: Garcia must be scheduled on Monday, so this is not necessarily true.
  D: Hong and Franco are scheduled on the same day, so this is not necessarily true.

Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the auditions, from first to last?
Choices:
  A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida
  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo

  4. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  5. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  6. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Let's check each option:
A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida
   Kammer's audition is first, which can be recorded. Then Trillo's audition, which can't be recorded, so it can't be the fourth. But Zinn's audition is third, which is not possible because Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. So, this option is not correct.
B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
   Waite's audition is first, which is possible. Kammer's audition is second, which can be recorded. Yoshida's audition is third, which is possible, and must be recorded. Zinn's audition is fourth and Lugo's audition is fifth, which satisfies the conditions. Trillo's audition is the last, which is also possible. So, this option could be the correct order.
C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida
   Waite's audition is first, which is possible. Lugo's audition is second, which can be recorded. Kammer's audition is third, which is possible, but it can't be recorded. Trillo's audition is the fourth, which can't be recorded, so this option is not correct.
D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
   Waite's audition is first, which is possible. Zinn's audition is second, which satisfies the condition. Kammer's audition is third, which can be recorded. Trillo's audition is fourth, which can't be recorded. Lugo's audition is fifth, which satisfies the condition. Yoshida's audition is last, which is possible. So, this option could be the correct order.
E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo
   Zinn's audition is first, which is possible. Yoshida's audition is second, which is possible, but it must be recorded. Waite's audition is third, which is not possible because Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. So, this option is not correct.

  - Choice B: Waite's audition is first, which satisfies the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition is before Trillo's, which satisfies the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Yoshida's audition is after the recorded auditions, which satisfies the condition that the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, this choice is possible.
  - Choice C: Lugo's audition is second, which contradicts the condition that Lugo's audition will be recorded. 
  - Choice D: The fourth audition cannot be recorded, but Zinn's audition is the second. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A corporate manager is selecting employees for a research team. The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. The selection is constrained by the following conditions: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team?
Choices:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt
  B: Ortega and Wong
  C: Paine and Schmidt
  D: Thomson and Yoder
  E: Yoder and Zayre
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The research team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  
Analysis:
  To form a pair of employees who must be on the team, we need to look for a constraint that requires that at least one of the two employees must be on the team. The only constraint that involves two employees is the one that applies to Wong. If Wong is on the team, then Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, the pair of employees who must be on the team is either Myers and Yoder or Wong and Yoder.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from the given eight.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  The two employees in the pair are Ortega and Wong. If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be, which means that Ortega must also be on the team. If Myers is not on the team, then Ortega may or may not be on the team, but Wong must be, which means that Yoder must also be on the team. In either case, at least one of Ortega and Wong must be on the team. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a total of eight employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine can be selected.
  If Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must also be selected.
  If Wong is selected, both Myers and Yoder must also be selected.

Analysis:
  To determine which pair of employees must be on the team, we must first identify any employees who must be on the team due to the constraints listed above:
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. So, if Myers is selected, we must also select either Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, or Zayre.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. So, if Schmidt is selected, we must also select Wong.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. So, if Wong is selected, we must also select either Schmidt, Thomson, or Zayre.
  From the above analysis, we can see that either Schmidt or Wong must be selected, and if either of them is selected, we must also select additional employees. This means that the answer must include either Schmidt or Wong.

Action: Answer("B") 
  If Wong is selected, both Myers and Yoder must also be selected. Therefore, if Wong is not selected and Schmidt is selected, we must also select both Paine and Thomson. The only answer choice that includes either Schmidt or Wong is B: Ortega and Wong. Therefore, we can conclude that Wong must be selected, and if Wong is selected, Myers and Yoder must also be selected. So, the answer is B: Ortega and Wong.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The team must include at least four employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  To solve this problem, we need to identify pairs of employees that must be on the team together, based on the given constraints. 
  Wong must be on the team with Myers and Yoder. Schmidt must be on the team with Paine and Thomson. However, Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team. Therefore, the only possible pair from the given choices is Thomson and Yoder, because they are both on the team with Schmidt, and they are not excluded by any other constraints.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The team will include at least four employees out of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  - If Myers is selected, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - If Schmidt is selected, then both Paine and Thomson must be.
  - If Wong is selected, then both Myers and Yoder must be.
  
Analysis:
  - We need to find a pair of employees that must be on the team.
  - If we select Myers, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. So, the pair cannot be Ortega and Schmidt.
  - If we select Schmidt, then both Paine and Thomson must be on the team. So, the pair cannot be Paine and Schmidt.
  - If we select Wong, then both Myers and Yoder must be on the team. So, the pair cannot be Ortega and Wong or Thomson and Yoder.
  - This leaves us with only one pair that can be on the team: Paine and Wong.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  To solve the question, we need to look for pairs of employees that are linked together in such a way that if one is selected, the other should also be selected. 
  Wong is linked to Myers and Yoder, so if Wong is selected, at least Myers or Yoder must also be selected.
  Schmidt is linked to Paine and Thomson, so if Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must be selected.
  Myers is linked to Ortega and Paine, so if Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine can be selected.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  The only pair of employees that are linked together and not covered by the above conditions is Ortega and Wong. Therefore, at least one of them must be on the team. Choice B, Ortega and Wong, is the correct answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  A: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Thus, Ortega and Schmidt cannot be a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  B: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Thus, Ortega and Wong cannot be a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  C: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Thus, Paine and Schmidt cannot be a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  D: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Thus, Yoder and Thomson cannot be a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  E: Yoder and Zayre are not mentioned in the given constraints.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees out of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  
Process of elimination:
  A: If Ortega is on the team, then neither Myers nor Paine can be on the team, which means neither Schmidt nor Thomson can be on the team, violating the second condition. Therefore, Ortega cannot be on the team with Schmidt. Eliminate A.
  B: If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must be on the team, which means neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team, violating the first condition. Therefore, Wong cannot be on the team with Ortega. Eliminate B.
  C: If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must be on the team, which means neither Myers nor Wong can be on the team, violating the third condition. Therefore, Schmidt cannot be on the team with Paine. Eliminate C.
  D: If Thomson is on the team, then Paine must be on the team, which means Schmidt must also be on the team, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, Thomson and Yoder can be on the team. Keep D.
  E: If Yoder is on the team, then Myers must be on the team, which means Wong must also be on the team, satisfying the third condition. Therefore, Yoder and Zayre can be on the team. Keep E.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Option Analysis:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt can't be on the team together because if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be, and if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  B: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be, but if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be, so Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team, which means Ortega can't be on the team.
  C: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be, so Paine and Schmidt will be on the team, which means Ortega and Myers can't be on the team.
  D: Thomson and Yoder can both be on the team without violating any constraints.
  E: Yoder and Zayre can both be on the team without violating any constraints.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  To form a team of at least 4 employees, the selection must include 4 or more employees from among the given 8 employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. 
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  Option A cannot be correct because Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team and if Schmidt is on the team, then Paine must also be on the team.
  Option B cannot be correct because if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team, but Ortega is not required to be on the team.
  Option C cannot be correct because if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team, but Ortega is not required to be on the team.
  Option D cannot be correct because there is no constraint that requires either Thomson or Yoder to be on the team.
  If Zayre is on the team, there is no constraint that requires any other employee to be on the team. Therefore, Zayre cannot be a part of a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn

  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  
Analysis:
  If Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then either Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. 
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. But, Ryan is already assigned to the project, so Tiffany must not be assigned to the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. But, Ryan and Yoshio are already assigned, so Mollie must not be assigned to the project.
  If Louis is assigned to 1923, then no one can be assigned to 1921 because Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923. But, Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, so Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923. But, Ryan is already assigned to the project, so Onyx must not be assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, the only possible assignment is that Mollie is assigned to 1922 and Louis is assigned to 1921.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, Tiffany, and Onyx are the remaining students to be assigned to the years.
  A: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  B: If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  Since Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, Olivia must lead one of the Friday sessions. This means that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Wednesday and Thursday. Therefore, Lan must lead a session on Friday morning, since she cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia. This leaves Nessa to lead the remaining session on Wednesday afternoon. Therefore, we can determine the sessions for all of the lab assistants except for one.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. Six lab sessions: Wed. morning, Wed. afternoon, Thurs. morning, Thurs. afternoon, Fri. morning, Fri. afternoon.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  We are given that Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session. 
  From rule 6, we know that Olivia cannot lead Thursday afternoon session, so she must lead either the Wednesday morning or the Wednesday afternoon session. 
  From rule 4, we know that Lan cannot lead either Wednesday session, so she must lead a session on Friday. 
  From rule 3, we know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead either Thursday afternoon or Friday afternoon. 
  From rule 1, we know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. 
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday morning and Wednesday afternoon sessions in some order. 
  So, we know the lab assistant for four of the six sessions: 
  Wednesday morning: Kevin or Rebecca 
  Wednesday afternoon: Kevin or Rebecca
  Thursday afternoon: Julio
  Friday morning: Lan, Olivia, or the remaining assistant (Nessa, Kevin, or Rebecca). 
  Thus, we can determine the lab assistant for four sessions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. The lab assistants are: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca
  2. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  5. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  6. Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  
We can use the given information to deduce the following schedule:
Wednesday morning: Lan or Olivia
Wednesday afternoon: Kevin or Rebecca
Thursday morning: Kevin or Rebecca
Thursday afternoon: Julio
Friday morning: Nessa
Friday afternoon: Lan or Olivia

We can determine the lab assistant for the Wednesday morning session based on the fact that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Lan or Olivia must lead the Wednesday morning session. 

We can determine the lab assistant for the Thursday morning session based on the fact that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, either Kevin or Rebecca must lead the Thursday morning session.

We can determine the lab assistant for the Friday morning session based on the fact that Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Therefore, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session and Lan or Olivia must lead the Friday morning session.

The lab assistant for the Wednesday afternoon session and the Friday afternoon session cannot be determined based on the given information.

Action: Answer("3")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are 6 lab sessions: 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon, one for each day.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, we can make the following deductions:
    - Julio cannot lead a morning session.
    - Olivia cannot lead the Friday afternoon session.
    - Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday or Thursday sessions.
    - Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
    - Lan cannot lead the Thursday morning session, and Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead the Friday morning session.
    - Therefore, Lan must lead the Wednesday morning session and Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Thursday morning session.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day from Wednesday to Friday.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  1. If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be held on Friday.
  2. Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Lan's session must be held on Wednesday. 
  3. Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, Nessa's session must be held on Thursday.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. The only day left with afternoon session is Friday, so Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  5. Therefore, we can determine the sessions of all the other lab assistants except for the session led by Lan.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: three in the morning and three in the afternoon, one for each day (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach: 
  1. Since Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, we know that neither Julio nor Olivia can lead the Friday sessions.
  2. Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session and Olivia cannot lead a Thursday afternoon session, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  3. Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, they must lead the Wednesday sessions.
  4. Since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Julio must lead a Wednesday session.
  5. Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Lan must lead a Thursday session.
  6. Therefore, we know the sessions led by Kevin and Rebecca, Julio, Nessa, and Lan, which is a total of 4 lab assistants.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. The lab assistants are Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session being held each morning and one each afternoon.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  We are given that Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, which means that Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, Olivia must lead the Friday morning session. Also, from the given statements, we know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and that Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions, and Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session. From the given statements, we also know that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Lan must lead the Wednesday afternoon session. This leaves only one session unaccounted for, which is the Thursday morning session. Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by all of the lab assistants except for the lab assistant who leads the Thursday morning session. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.

  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then the following assignments are true:
  - Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  - Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session or the Friday morning session.
  - Lan cannot lead the Thursday morning session or the Friday afternoon session.
  - Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Thursday.
  
  We can make the following assignments:
  - Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  - Nessa leads the Friday afternoon session.
  - Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session or the Friday morning session, so she must lead the Wednesday morning session or the Wednesday afternoon session.
  - Lan cannot lead the Thursday morning session or the Friday afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday morning session or the Wednesday afternoon session.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Kevin must lead the Wednesday morning session and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday afternoon session.
  
  Therefore, we can determine the lab session assignments for five of the lab assistants: Julio, Nessa, Kevin, Rebecca, and either Lan or Olivia. We cannot determine the lab session assignment for the remaining lab assistant.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. The lab sessions are scheduled over three days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  2. Each day has one morning and one afternoon session.
  3. There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on the same day.
  5. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  6. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  7. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Method:
  We can use the given information to deduce the possible schedules for the lab assistants. If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, we can use the given constraints to determine the possible schedules for the other lab assistants. We can then count how many of them have a unique schedule.

Analysis:
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Therefore, Nessa leads the Friday afternoon session.
  - Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on the same day. Therefore, they lead the Wednesday sessions.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. Therefore, Lan leads the Thursday morning session and Olivia leads the Wednesday morning session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Julio leads the Tuesday morning session.
  
We have determined the schedule for all of the lab assistants except for one. Therefore, the answer is A: one.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are six lab sessions, one each morning and one each afternoon over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead either the Wednesday or Thursday sessions.
  Nessa cannot lead the Wednesday afternoon session.
  Lan cannot lead the Thursday morning session.
  
Analysis:
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session. 
  Therefore, there are two lab sessions left for Olivia, which are the Thursday morning and the Friday morning sessions. 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead either the Wednesday or Thursday sessions. Therefore, the Wednesday and Thursday morning sessions are led by Kevin and Rebecca. 
  Nessa cannot lead the Wednesday afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session. 
  Lan cannot lead the Thursday morning session, so he must lead the Wednesday morning session. 
  Therefore, the lab assistants and their sessions are:
  Wednesday morning: Lan
  Wednesday afternoon: Kevin
  Thursday morning: Rebecca
  Thursday afternoon: Julio
  Friday morning: Olivia
  Friday afternoon: Nessa
  
  We can determine the sessions for Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca. Therefore, for five of the other lab assistants, we can determine which sessions they lead.

Solution:
  Let's check each option:
  A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then that wall would have only the works of Franz and Greene, which violates one of the given conditions. So, this cannot be true.
  B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would have only the works of Franz and Hidalgo, which violates one of the given conditions. So, this cannot be true.
  C: This can be true. According to the given condition, "Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed." This doesn't mean that Greene's oil cannot be displayed in an upper position on another wall.
  D: This can be true. There is no given condition that prohibits Hidalgo's watercolor from being displayed in a lower position.
  E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would have only the works of Isaacs and Hidalgo, which violates one of the given conditions. So, this cannot be true.
  
Therefore, the answer is (B) Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student will display one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  Each wall will have exactly two paintings displayed - one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  We need to determine which of the given options is not possible based on the given conditions.
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
    According to the given condition, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, this option is possible.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    This is possible because no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
    This is not possible because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, this option is the answer.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
    This is possible because each wall will have exactly two paintings displayed - one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    This is possible because no wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each student displays exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. Two paintings are displayed on each wall, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.

  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Analysis:
  According to condition 3, each wall must have at least one oil painting. Therefore, it is impossible for Hidalgo's two paintings to be displayed on the same wall, since Hidalgo is one of the four students and each wall must have paintings from at least two students. This means that option B is impossible, so it CANNOT be true.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. 
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.

C: This statement can be true. According to the conditions, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, it is possible that Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
D: This statement can be true. There is no condition that restricts the position of Hidalgo's watercolor.
E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would have the works of only two students, which is not possible according to the conditions.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The exhibition room has 4 walls and each wall will display 2 paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position. 
  Each of the 4 art students will display exactly 2 paintings - 1 oil and 1 watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  Let us try to find the combination that violates the given conditions.
  Suppose option A is true i.e., Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  Then, Franz's oil should be displayed on wall 2 or 3 (because Greene's watercolor is in upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed).
  But, Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4 and no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, option A cannot be true.
  Similarly, we can check the other options:
    Option B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Franz's oil should be on wall 2 or 3. But, Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4 and no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, option B cannot be true.
    Option C: This is possible because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
    Option D: This is possible because we know that each wall will display exactly 1 oil and 1 watercolor and Hidalgo has both an oil and a watercolor painting.
    Option E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Hidalgo's watercolor should be on wall 1, 2, or 3. But, no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, option E cannot be true.
  Therefore, the answer is Option B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.

  7. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  8. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then one of the walls will have only the work of Franz and Greene. This is not allowed by condition 5. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then one of the walls will have only the work of Franz and Hidalgo. This is not allowed by condition 5. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: This statement is possible because condition 7 states that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position on the same wall. This means that the other painting on that wall must be Isaacs's watercolor, which violates condition 4. Therefore, D cannot be true.
E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then one of the walls will have only the work of Isaacs and Hidalgo. This is not allowed by condition 5. Therefore, E cannot be true.

  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then that would mean that wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Greene displayed on it, which is not allowed. So, A can't be true.
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that would mean that wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Hidalgo displayed on it, which is not allowed. So, B can't be true.
  If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then that would mean that Greene's watercolor, which must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil, would have to be displayed in the lower position, which is not allowed. So, C can't be true.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then that would mean that Hidalgo's oil, which must be displayed on the same wall as either Franz's or Greene's painting, would have to be displayed in the upper position, which is not allowed. So, D can't be true.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that would mean that wall has both a painting by Isaacs and a painting by Hidalgo displayed on it, which is not allowed. So, E can't be true.

Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert
  D: Kyle and Nina
  E: Olivia and Kyle
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Six individual oral reports will be given during three consecutive days.
- Two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- If a pair of students give reports on the same day as each other, they must give reports on different days in the next two days.
Action: 
- From the given conditions, George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he will not be paired with anyone on Wednesday.
- If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. 
- If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving can give reports on Monday and Wednesday.
- If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday. 
- Based on the above conditions, we can infer that Nina will not be paired with anyone on Wednesday.
- Therefore, if any student gives a report on Wednesday, they will not be paired with Nina. 
- From the answer choices, the only pair that includes a student who must give a report on Wednesday is (B) Helen and Nina.
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can make the following deductions:
  1. George must give his report on Tuesday.
  2. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day.
  3. If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday.
  4. If Nina does not give her report on Tuesday, then she must give it on Wednesday.
  5. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Hence, they must give morning reports. Therefore, they cannot give reports on the same day.
  6. Exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Therefore, if two students give reports on the same day, they must give reports in different time slots.
  
Now, we can check which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day:
  A: George and Lenore - George must give his report on Tuesday. Lenore cannot give her report on Tuesday. Therefore, they cannot give reports on the same day.
  B: Helen and Nina - If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Helen and Nina cannot give reports on the same day. If Nina does not give her report on Tuesday, then she must give it on Wednesday. Therefore, Helen and Nina can give reports on the same day, but we cannot say for sure that they must give reports on Wednesday.
  C: Irving and Robert - Robert cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, he must give a morning report. Irving cannot give a report on Tuesday. If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Irving must give his report on Wednesday. Therefore, Irving and Robert can give reports on the same day, but we cannot say for sure that they must give reports on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle and Nina - If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Kyle must give his report on Monday. Therefore, Kyle and Nina cannot give reports on the same day. If Nina does not give her report on Tuesday, then she must give it on Wednesday. Therefore, Kyle and Nina can give reports on the same day, but we cannot say for sure that they must give reports on Wednesday.
  E: Olivia and Kyle - Olivia cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, she must give a morning report. If Kyle gives his report on Tuesday, then he cannot give his report on Wednesday. If Kyle gives his report on Monday, then he cannot give his report on Wednesday. Therefore, Olivia and Kyle can give reports on the same day, but we cannot say for sure that they must give reports on Wednesday.

  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - There are 8 students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  - Exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. This means that George cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving don't have to give reports on Wednesday. This means that George must give a report on Tuesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Thursday. This means that George must give a report on Tuesday.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give reports in the morning.
  - Only 2 people can give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then only one of Helen and Irving can give a report on Wednesday.
  - George cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  - There are 3 possible pairs of students who must give reports on Wednesday: (Helen, Irving), (Helen, Kyle), and (Irving, Kyle).
  - Helen cannot give a report on Monday because she would have to give another report on Tuesday if Nina gave a report on Monday.
  - George cannot give a report on Monday because Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  - Lenore is not involved in any of the conditions.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:

  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Let's consider each option:
  A. If George and Lenore give reports on the same day, it cannot be on Tuesday as George can only report on Tuesday. If they give reports on Monday, then it is possible that Irving and Helen give reports on Tuesday, and then Kyle and Nina give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, George and Lenore do not have to give reports on Wednesday together.
  B. If Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, and Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Helen and Nina do not have to give reports on Wednesday together.
  C. If Irving and Robert give reports on the same day, then it cannot be on Wednesday, as Robert cannot give an afternoon report. If they give reports on Monday, then it is possible that Helen and Nina give reports on Tuesday, and then Kyle and Lenore give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Irving and Robert do not have to give reports on Wednesday together.
  D. If Kyle and Nina give reports on the same day, and Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Kyle and Nina do not have to give reports on Wednesday together.
  E. If Olivia and Kyle give reports on the same day, it cannot be on Wednesday, as Olivia cannot give an afternoon report. If they give reports on Monday, then it is possible that Irving and Helen give reports on Tuesday, and then George and Nina give reports on Wednesday.

Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after Nina's report) Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Only six students can give reports during three consecutive days, which means two students will not give a report.
  
Analysis:
  1. Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  2. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after Nina's report) Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means if Nina gives a report on Monday, then both Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  3. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. This means if either Olivia or Robert gives a report, it will be in the morning.

A: George and Lenore could give reports on Monday. If this is the case, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, leaving only Kyle and Nina to give reports on Wednesday. This means that the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are not George and Lenore. Eliminate A.
B: If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after Nina's report) Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give afternoon reports, this means that Olivia and Robert must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina and Helen give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday. Keep B.
C: If Robert gives a report, it will be in the morning, and it could be on either Monday or Wednesday. This means that if Irving gives a report, it will be on Tuesday, and he could be paired with either Kyle or Nina. Therefore, there is no guarantee that Irving and Robert will give reports on the same day, let alone on Wednesday. Eliminate C.
D: If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after Nina's report) Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give afternoon reports, this means that Olivia and Robert must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina and Kyle give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday. Eliminate D.
E: If Olivia gives a report, it will be in the morning, and it could be on either Monday or Wednesday. This means that if Kyle gives a report, it will be on Tuesday, and he could be paired with either Helen or Irving. Therefore, there is no guarantee that Olivia and Kyle will give reports on the same day, let alone on Wednesday. Eliminate E.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- George must give a report only on Tuesday.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Solution:
- If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day (Tuesday or Wednesday), which means that Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report, it must be on Monday.
- If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and the only remaining student who hasn't given a report is Kyle. Therefore, Kyle must give a report on Wednesday.
- George must give a report only on Tuesday, which means that he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, which means that they both must give reports in the morning.
- Lenore is the only remaining student who hasn't been mentioned yet, which means that she must give a report on Monday or Tuesday.

Possible schedule:
Monday: Nina (morning), Lenore (afternoon)
Tuesday: George (morning), Helen (afternoon), Irving (afternoon)
Wednesday: Olivia (morning), Robert (morning), Kyle (afternoon)

To find the answer to the question, we need to look at the pairs of students who must give reports on the same day as each other:
- George cannot give a report on Wednesday, which means that he cannot be part of the answer.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, which means that they cannot be part of the answer.
- Lenore has already given a report on Monday or Tuesday, which means that she cannot be part of the answer.
- Kyle has to give a report on Wednesday, which means that he cannot be part of the answer.

Therefore, the only possible pair of students who must give reports on the same day as each other and who haven't been eliminated yet is Helen and Nina.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

Solution:
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday (the next day) both Helen and Irving must give reports. This means that George cannot give his report on Tuesday, because there is only one spot left in the morning. Therefore, Nina cannot give her report on Monday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then on Wednesday (the next day) neither Helen nor Irving can give a report, because they both gave a report on the previous day. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then neither Helen nor Irving are required to give a report on the next day, because Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - We know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give their reports in the morning. 
  - We also know that George must give his report on Tuesday.
  - Therefore, the only possible pairs of students who can give reports on Wednesday are (Helen, Irving) and (Lenore, Kyle).
  - If (Helen, Irving) give their reports on Wednesday, then the remaining pair of students who give reports on Monday is (Lenore, Kyle), and the remaining pair of students who give reports on Tuesday is (George, Nina).
  - Therefore, George and Nina must give reports on the same day as each other, and that day must be Tuesday, because George can only give his report on Tuesday.
  - Answer: B) Helen and Nina. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Approach:
  1. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday, because that would mean Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which violates the condition that George must give a report on Tuesday.
  2. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report, then neither Helen nor Irving can give a report on Monday.
  3. If Nina does not give a report, then neither Helen nor Irving can give a report on Tuesday.
  4. We want to find a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday. This means that one of the students in the pair must be Helen or Irving, because they are the only students who can give a report on Wednesday if Nina gives a report. The other student in the pair must be one of the students who cannot give an afternoon report (Olivia or Robert), because they cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday.

Solution:
  1. If Nina gives a report, then neither Helen nor Irving can give a report on Monday. Therefore, the only possible pairs of students who can give reports on Wednesday are (Helen, Olivia) and (Irving, Robert).
  2. If Nina does not give a report, then neither Helen nor Irving can give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, the only possible pairs of students who can give reports on Wednesday are (Helen, Robert) and (Irving, Olivia).
  3. None of the pairs of students in choices A, B, D, or E satisfy the conditions above.
  4. Therefore, the answer is C: Irving and Robert. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Process of elimination:
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot be paired with anyone on Wednesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they cannot be paired with anyone in the afternoon on Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina cannot be paired with Helen or Irving on Wednesday.
  - This leaves Kyle, Lenore, and Nina as the only possible students who can be paired with someone on Wednesday.
  - Kyle and Nina are not a valid pair because they cannot both give reports on the same day.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The only remaining pair is Helen and Nina, so if they give reports on the same day as each other, they must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Six students will give individual oral reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, with two reports given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  2. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  A: There is no information that suggests George or Lenore must give reports on Wednesday.
  B: There is no information that suggests Helen or Nina must give reports on Wednesday.
  C: There is no information that suggests Irving or Robert must give reports on Wednesday.
  D: If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, which is Wednesday. So, if Kyle gives a report on Wednesday, then Kyle and Nina must give reports on Wednesday, which means D is a possible answer.
  E: There is no information that suggests Olivia or Kyle must give reports on Wednesday.

  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.

Action: Based on the given constraints, we can determine that the optometrist and the veterinarian cannot be in spaces 1 or 7 since they are reserved for the pharmacy and one of the restaurants. Therefore, the optometrist and the veterinarian must be in spaces 3, 4, 5, or 6. The pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 1. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 3 or space 5. Since the shoe store is in space 2, the only option that could be true is that the pharmacy is in space 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) The pharmacy is in space 1. Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. There are four lectures on different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  2. Each art historian gives one lecture on a different topic.
  3. The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  4. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  5. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
Since the watercolors lecture is third, we can assume that the lectures are scheduled in the following order: 

1. _______________
2. _______________
3. Watercolors
4. _______________

Now, we can evaluate each option based on the given constraints:
A: Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture. Eliminate A.
B: The oil paintings lecture must be later than the watercolors lecture, so Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture. Eliminate B.
C: This option is possible. We don't have any constraints related to who gives the sculptures lecture. Keep C.
D: Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Since Garcia and Jiang have not given their lectures yet, we cannot determine if Holden can give the sculptures lecture. Eliminate D.
E: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture, so Jiang cannot give the lithographs lecture. Eliminate E.

Therefore, the answer is C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are four lectures on four different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives a lecture on a different topic.
  - The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints:
    1. Oil paintings and watercolors must both be earlier than lithographs.
    2. Farley's lecture must be earlier than oil paintings.
    3. Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.

If the watercolors lecture is third, then we know that the order of the lectures is either:

1. Lithographs, oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures
2. Oil paintings, lithographs, watercolors, sculptures

We can use the constraints to eliminate some of the answer choices:
- Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture (because watercolors is the third lecture).
- Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture (because oil paintings must be earlier than lithographs, which means it cannot be the second lecture).
- Garcia cannot give the sculptures lecture (because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture).
- Jiang cannot give the lithographs lecture (because lithographs is either the first or second lecture).

That leaves us with only one possible answer:
Action: Answer("D") - Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are 4 lectures on different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  2. Each lecture is given by one of the four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
  3. Each art historian gives a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  4. The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  5. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  6. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  7. The watercolors lecture is third.
  
Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation: 
  If watercolors is third, then we know that the order of the lectures is either Oil Paintings - Sculptures - Watercolors - Lithographs or Sculptures - Oil Paintings - Watercolors - Lithographs. 
  Option A is not possible because we know that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Option B is not possible because we know that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Option C is not possible because we know that Garcia's lecture must be later than Holden's lecture.
  Option D is possible because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lectures, and the watercolors lecture is third.
  Option E is not possible because we know that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are four lectures, each on a different topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then it must be preceded by both the oil paintings lecture and the lecture on another topic.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we can deduce that the order of the lectures is as follows:
  1st: Farley's lecture (either on oil paintings or sculptures)
  2nd: Holden's lecture (either on sculptures or oil paintings)
  3rd: Lecture on watercolors
  4th: Either Garcia or Jiang's lecture (on the remaining topics: oil paintings or lithographs)
  
  A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then he must give the first lecture, which must be on either oil paintings or sculptures. This would violate the condition that the watercolors lecture is third.
  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then either Holden or Farley must give the first lecture, which must be on sculptures. This would violate the condition that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then either Holden or Farley must give the first lecture, which must be on oil paintings. This would violate the condition that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then the first lecture must be given by Farley on oil paintings, and the second lecture must be given by Garcia or Jiang on watercolors. The fourth lecture must then be given by Garcia or Jiang on lithographs.
  E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the first lecture must be given by Farley on oil paintings, the second lecture must be given by Holden on sculptures, and the third lecture must be given by Garcia on watercolors.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
  - Each historian will give a lecture on a different topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.

  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
  If the watercolors lecture is third, that means that the lectures will be in the following order: 
  [1] _____
  [2] _____
  [3] Watercolors
  [4] _____ 

  A: It is not possible for Farley to give the watercolors lecture since it is already the third lecture.
  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then the order would be: 
     [1] _____
     [2] Garcia (Oil paintings)
     [3] Watercolors
     [4] _____ 
     But we don't know the order of the remaining two lectures, so we cannot confirm if this is true.
  C: If Garcia doesn't give the oil paintings lecture, then it is possible for her to give the sculptures lecture. The order would be:
     [1] _____
     [2] _____
     [3] Watercolors
     [4] Garcia (Sculptures)
     And Holden would give the oil paintings lecture. This is a valid order.
  D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then the order would be:
     [1] _____
     [2] _____
     [3] Watercolors
     [4] Holden (Sculptures)
     But we don't know the order of the remaining two lectures, so we cannot confirm if this is true.
  E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the order would be:
     [1] _____
     [2] _____
     [3] Watercolors
     [4] Jiang (Lithographs)
     And Holden would give the sculptures lecture, while Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. This is a valid order.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are four lectures, one on each of the following topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives a lecture on a different topic.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures must be: [?, ?, watercolors, ?] where ? represents the lectures that do not have a specific order.

A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then the order of the lectures would be: [Farley, ?, watercolors, ?]. However, we know that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so this is not possible.

B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then the order of the lectures would be: [Farley, Garcia, watercolors, ?]. We know that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so the only possibility is for Holden to give the sculptures lecture, and Jiang to give the lithographs lecture. Therefore, this could be true.

C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the lectures would be: [Farley, Holden, watercolors, Garcia]. This violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture, so this is not possible.

D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the lectures would be: [Farley, Holden, watercolors, ?]. We know that Garcia's lecture must be later than Holden's lecture, but we do not know the order of the remaining lectures. Therefore, this could be true.

E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the order of the lectures would be: [Farley, Holden, watercolors, Jiang]. This violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture, so this is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then the first two lectures must be either oil paintings and sculptures, or sculptures and oil paintings, in some order. 
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture must be the first lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden's lecture must be the second lecture. 
  - Therefore, the first two lectures must be Farley's lecture on watercolors and Holden's lecture on sculptures. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures on different topics.
  - The topics are: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian will give a lecture on a different topic.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either: oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs.
  
Analysis:
  - Option A is impossible because Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture if it is third.
  - Option B is possible. If the order of the lectures is sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs, then Garcia can give the oil paintings lecture.
  - Option C is impossible because Garcia cannot give the sculptures lecture if Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture.
  - Option D is impossible because Holden's lecture must be earlier than the sculptures lecture.
  - Option E is possible. If the order of the lectures is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs, then Jiang can give the lithographs lecture.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable assignment of photographers to the two graduation ceremonies?
Choices:
  A: Silva University: Gonzalez, Lai Thorne University: Frost, Heideck, Mays
  B: Silva University: Gonzalez, Mays Thorne University: Knutson, Lai
  C: Silva University: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck Thorne University: Knutson, Lai, Mays
  D: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays Thorne University: Gonzalez, Lai
  E: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays Thorne University: Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai

  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  According to the constraints, Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony. 
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  Therefore, we can eliminate A, B, and D because they violate one or more of these constraints.
  C and E both satisfy all constraints. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony.
  Lai and Mays cannot be assigned to the same ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne University.
  If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  There are two ceremonies and at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.
  
Elimination:
  A: Frost and Heideck are assigned to different ceremonies, so this option is not acceptable.
  B: This option violates the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony.
  C: This option violates the constraint that Lai and Mays cannot be assigned to the same ceremony.
  D: This option satisfies all of the constraints and has at least two photographers assigned to each ceremony. 
  E: This option violates the constraint that Knutson must be assigned to Thorne University if Heideck and Mays are not assigned to it.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To solve this problem, we can use the given constraints to eliminate some of the choices. We know that Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so any choice that does not have Frost and Heideck together in one ceremony is incorrect. We also know that if Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, so any choice that has Lai and Mays assigned to the same ceremony is incorrect. Finally, if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so any choice that violates this constraint is incorrect. 

Using these constraints, we can eliminate choices A, B, and D. 

That leaves us with two choices: C and E. 

If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Choice C has Knutson assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Heideck and Mays cannot both be assigned to it. Therefore, choice C is incorrect. 

The correct answer is therefore choice E: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays Thorne University: Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then at most one botanist can be selected.
  If M is not selected, then at most one botanist can be selected.
  If F is selected, then K and M cannot both be selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, then M cannot be selected. However, there is no rule that prevents G from being selected if K is selected. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true.
  B: If L is selected, then at most one botanist can be selected. Since F is a botanist, F cannot be selected if L is selected. Therefore, this choice is true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be either K, L, or M. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, they can be any two of the three chemists. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G can be one of the selected scientists. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R are not selected, and at most one botanist is selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, and if G is selected, then we have two botanists (F and G), which means at most one zoologist can be selected. This violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If L is selected, then we cannot have F and K both not selected. This is because we need at least one botanist, and if F is not selected, then we need K to be selected. But K and L cannot both be selected. Therefore, B is true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This is not true because we can have L or M as the only chemist selected. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, and if F is selected, then we cannot have K and M both not selected. But K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, D is true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, and if G is selected, then we cannot have K and M both not selected. But K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, E is true.

Action: Answer("B") and Answer("D") and Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R are not selected.
  
  Based on the given conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - If F is selected, then G and H cannot both be selected.
  - If G is selected, then F and H cannot both be selected.
  - If H is selected, then F and G cannot both be selected.
  - If K is selected, then F and M cannot both be selected.
  - If L is selected, then G and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, then K is not selected.
  - If P is selected, then Q and R cannot both be not selected.
  
  Let's examine each choice:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. -> This is not necessarily true. For example, if K and F are not selected, then G can be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. -> This is not necessarily true. For example, if L and K are selected, then F can still be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. -> This is not necessarily true. For example, if L and Q are selected, then K is not selected.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. -> This is necessarily true. If exactly two chemists are selected, and one of them is K, then F cannot be selected due to the condition "F and K cannot both be selected."
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. -> This is not necessarily true. For example, if K and L are selected, then G can still be selected.
  
  Therefore, the answer is (D) If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Since P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as one of the botanists. 

A: If K is selected, F or G must be selected as one of the botanists since at least one scientist of each type must be selected.
   Therefore, there is no logical reason why G cannot be selected if K is selected. This statement is not necessarily true.
B: If L is selected, then K and M cannot be selected because F or G must be selected as one of the botanists. 
   Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
C: If exactly one chemist is selected, then this chemist must be either K, L, or M since at least one scientist of each type must be selected. 
   Therefore, this statement is true.
D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then neither K nor M can be selected because F or G must be selected as one of the botanists, and at most one zoologist can be selected.
   Therefore, this statement is true. 
E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then neither K nor M can be selected because F or G must be selected as one of the botanists, and at most one zoologist can be selected.
   Therefore, this statement is true.

Both (C) and (D) are true given that P is the only zoologist selected. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist from each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("C")

If P is the only zoologist selected, then we must have at least one botanist and one chemist selected. Since F and K cannot be selected together, if P is the only zoologist, then we must have either F or K selected, but not both. If we have exactly one chemist selected, then it must be K, because if it were L or M, we would violate the conditions that F and K cannot both be selected and K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, if exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. So the answer is (C).
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K or L must be selected as a chemist.
  
  Let's evaluate each option:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. G can be selected as a botanist even if K is selected as a chemist.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. F can be selected as a botanist even if L is selected as a chemist.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - This is not necessarily true. Either K or L can be selected as a chemist.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. - This is true. If two chemists are selected, they must be either K and L, or L and M, since K and M cannot be selected together. In either case, F cannot be selected as a botanist because it would violate the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. G can be selected as a botanist even if two chemists are selected.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two types of scientists must be botanists and chemists. This is because the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, Q and R cannot be selected.

If K is selected, then F and G cannot both be selected because F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, A is true.

If L is selected, then there are only two chemists left to choose from: K and M. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. This violates the condition that P is the only zoologist selected. Therefore, M cannot be selected. If K is selected, then G can still be selected. Therefore, B is false.

If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be either L or M. If L is selected, then F and G can still be selected. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. This violates the condition that P is the only zoologist selected. Therefore, C is false.

If exactly two chemists are selected, then they must be L and K. In this case, F and G can still be selected. Therefore, D is false and E is true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  A panel of scientists must be formed, including at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then neither Q nor R can be selected as they are the other two zoologists.
  
Analysis: 
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then we know that Q and R cannot be selected. Therefore, if M is selected, then the only remaining option is to select F and K as the botanists. If both F and K are selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which means P cannot be selected. Therefore, M cannot be selected. This means that at most one chemist can be selected, and if a chemist is selected, it must be L, as K and M are not available options. If L is selected, F can still be selected, so option B is not true. If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be L, so option C is true. If exactly two chemists are selected, then K and M are not available options, so it must be L and one of F or G. Therefore, option D is not true. If exactly two chemists are selected, it is possible to select G, so option E is not true. If K is selected, G can still be selected, so option A is not true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:

  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, it is possible to select both F and G. Therefore, this statement is not true.
  B: If L is selected, it is possible to select F. Therefore, this statement is not true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be either K, L, or M. Therefore, this statement is not true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, it means that either K and L, K and M, or L and M are selected. If K and L are selected, it is possible to select F. If K and M are selected, it is not possible to select F. Therefore, this statement is not always true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, it means that either K and L, K and M, or L and M are selected. If K and L are selected, it is possible to select G. If K and M are selected, it is not possible to select G. Therefore, this statement is true.

  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist. 
  - If L is selected, then K and M cannot both be selected because K and M cannot both be selected. 
  - If K is not selected, then G can be selected. Therefore, if L is selected, F can be selected. 
  - If F is selected, then there will be at least two botanists and at most one zoologist. This violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. 
  - Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We need to find a sales representative that cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  
Elimination:
  If Quinn is in Zone 1 or Zone 2, then the sales representative that must be with Quinn is either Parra or Tiao, but both of them are already assigned to a zone.
  If Quinn is in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall must also be in Zone 3, which means there are already three sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only option left is Kim, Mahr, or Tiao.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  If Quinn works with Parra and Stuckey/Udall, the only remaining sales representatives for Zone 2 will be Tiao and Mahr. But we know that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao must be in Zone 3. So, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives and three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  We need to determine in which sales zone Quinn cannot work based on the given conditions.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Process of elimination:
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Kim, then Parra and Quinn would not be in the same sales zone, which violates the condition that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone. Therefore, A is not the answer.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Mahr, then there would be at most one sales representative in Zone 3, which violates the condition that there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, B is not the answer.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Udall would be working in Zone 2, which violates the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, C is not the answer.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Tiao, then Parra would be working in Zone 1, which violates the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, D is not the answer.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Udall, then Stuckey would be working in Zone 3, which does not violate any of the given conditions. Therefore, E is the answer.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. There are three sales zones, and exactly seven sales representatives.
  2. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  3. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  4. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  6. More of the sales representatives are working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
To determine which of the choices Quinn cannot work with, we need to consider the given conditions. We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. We also know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Finally, we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

If Quinn were to work in Zone 1, then Parra would also work in Zone 1, which would violate the condition that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.

If Quinn were to work in Zone 2, then either Tiao or Udall would also work in Zone 2, which would violate the condition that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.

If Quinn were to work in Zone 3, then there would be at least three sales representatives in Zone 3, which would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then they both cannot work in Zones 1 or 2. 
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, then they both cannot work in Zones 1 or 2.
  If there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then at least 3 sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  
  A: Kim could work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  B: Mahr could work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  C: Stuckey cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn since they both work in different sales zones.
  D: Tiao could work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2, but not both.
  E: Udall could work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We need to find the sales representative that Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  
Analysis:
  Parra and Quinn must work in the same sales zone. Therefore, Parra must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 3, which means Udall must work in Zone 2. This leaves Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey to work in Zone 3, which contradicts the statement that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra must work in Zone 3, which means Tiao must work in Zone 1 and Udall must work in Zone 2. This leaves Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey to work in Zone 3. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn is in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Stuckey and Udall are in the same sales zone.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Reasoning:
  If Quinn is in the same sales zone as Parra, then either of the following could be true:
    1. Parra and Quinn are both in Zone 1, and Tiao and Udall are both in Zone 3.
    2. Parra and Quinn are both in Zone 3, and Tiao and Udall are both in Zone 2.
  In both cases, Quinn cannot be in the same sales zone as Stuckey, because Stuckey is either in Zone 2 or Zone 3. Therefore,
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
To determine who Quinn cannot work with, we must first determine which sales representative(s) work in Zone 3. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we know that at least 3 representatives work in Zone 3. 
If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, and no more than 2 representatives can work in Zone 3. This contradicts with the given information that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 1. 
If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, and Udall must work in Zone 2. This means that Stuckey works in Zone 3 as well, since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Quinn work in Zone 2. 
Thus, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives.
  The sales representatives are assigned to work in one of three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey or Udall, then there will be three sales representatives in that zone, and only two in each of the other zones, which violates the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey or Udall.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
Choices:
  A: Julio, Nessa
  B: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  E: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - The lab sessions are scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session being held each morning and one each afternoon.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
Working through the constraints, we know that Kevin's session and Nessa's session are on consecutive days, so it must be either Wednesday and Thursday or Thursday and Friday. If Kevin and Rebecca are on the same day, then they can only be on Thursday or Friday. Therefore, Kevin's session is on Thursday, and Nessa's session is on Friday.
Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Olivia must lead a session on Wednesday or Thursday. Since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Julio's session is on Wednesday. That leaves Lan to lead a session on Friday.
So, the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Nessa.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are three days for the lab sessions: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Each day has one morning and one afternoon session.
  
Analysis:
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. 
  So, the lab assistants who cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session are Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, and Olivia. 
  The lab assistants who can lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Lan. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: Julio, Nessa.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday.
  Thursday afternoon session cannot be led by Rebecca because she is paired with Kevin.
  
Reasoning: 
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday. 
  Therefore, the Thursday afternoon session cannot be led by Nessa. 
  Since Kevin is paired with Rebecca, the Thursday afternoon session cannot be led by Rebecca either.
  From the remaining lab assistants (Julio, Lan, and Olivia), only Julio's session can be on Wednesday (since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's). 
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia's sessions must be on Thursday and Friday, though we don't know which one is on which day. 
  However, we know that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. 
  Therefore, it must be either Julio or Nessa who leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  If Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, then Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday.
  On Thursday afternoon, neither Lan nor Olivia can lead the session since they cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  Therefore, Julio, Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca are the only possible lab assistants.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

Let's start by forming a timeline of lab sessions and lab assistants:
Wednesday: [Julio?, _], [_, _]
Thursday: [_, _], [Nessa, _]
Friday: [_, _], [Olivia?, _]

If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Wednesday, and Nessa must lead the Thursday afternoon session. Thus, Olivia's session must be on Friday, and Julio's session must be on Wednesday. Lan cannot be the lab assistant for any of the Thursday sessions due to constraint 2. Therefore, the possible lab assistants for the Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Nessa.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are six lab sessions: one morning and one afternoon session on each of the three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session can be on either Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, and Nessa's session can be on either Friday afternoon or Wednesday afternoon. Because Nessa must lead an afternoon session, she cannot lead Wednesday afternoon's session. Therefore, Nessa's session must be Friday afternoon, which means that Kevin's session must be Thursday afternoon, and Julio's and Olivia's sessions must be on Wednesday.

  A: Julio and Nessa cannot lead sessions on the same day, so Julio cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Incorrect.
  B: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, but Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because she has to lead a session on the same day as Kevin. Incorrect.
  C: Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon, and Nessa must lead a session on Thursday afternoon, so both could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Rebecca has to lead a session on the same day as Kevin, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Correct.
  D: Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon, and Nessa must lead a session on Thursday afternoon, so both could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Rebecca has to lead a session on the same day as Kevin, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Julio's session must be on Wednesday, so he cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Incorrect.
  E: Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon, and Nessa must lead a session on Thursday afternoon, so both could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Rebecca has to lead a session on the same day as Kevin, so she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Julio's and Olivia's sessions must be on Wednesday, so they cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are six lab sessions: Wed. morning, Wed. afternoon, Thurs. morning, Thurs. afternoon, Fri. morning, Fri. afternoon.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then there are two possibilities:
  1) Kevin's session is on Wednesday afternoon and Nessa's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  2) Kevin's session is on Thursday morning and Nessa's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  
  If Kevin's session is on Wednesday afternoon, then Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning, and Olivia's session must be on Friday morning. Therefore, Lan and Nessa must lead the Thursday sessions.
  
  If Kevin's session is on Thursday morning, then Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning, and Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Nessa, Julio, Kevin, and Rebecca are already assigned to other sessions, leaving only Lan and Olivia as possible lab assistants for the Thursday afternoon session.
  
  So, the answer is either Lan and Nessa (if Kevin's session is on Wednesday afternoon) or Lan and Olivia (if Kevin's session is on Thursday morning).
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  6. There are two lab sessions per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  7. There are three lab session days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  
  We know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so if Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday and Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Thursday. Therefore, Lan and Olivia cannot be lab assistants on Thursday afternoon. 
  
  This means that the only possible lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio, Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  Thursday afternoon session cannot be led by Rebecca, Lan, or Olivia.
  
Reasoning:
  If Kevin's session is on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon. Therefore, on Thursday afternoon, we can choose a lab assistant from Julio, Kevin, and Rebecca. We cannot choose Nessa since she must lead an afternoon session and she is leading the Friday afternoon session. We cannot choose Lan or Olivia since they cannot lead sessions on the same day as each other. Therefore, the answer is D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six lab assistants available: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  6. There are six lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
  
We are given that Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's. This means that Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon, and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. Now, we need to find a list of lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session. 

Julio cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because his session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Olivia's session must be on Friday morning, so Julio's session must be on either Wednesday morning or Wednesday afternoon. Therefore, Julio cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. 

Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because she cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day as Olivia's session. Olivia's session must be on Friday morning, so Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. 

We are given that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and her session is on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Nessa cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. 

We are given that Kevin's session meets on Thursday afternoon. Therefore, Kevin cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. 

Rebecca can lead the Thursday afternoon session because she has not been ruled out by any of the constraints. 

So, the complete and accurate list of lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session is: 
Rebecca

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which one of the following is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We are to schedule 6 bands- Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign and Zircon in 6 slots numbered 1 to 6.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  We need to find the earliest slot where Wellspring can perform if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  
  If Yardsign performs in slot 1, then Zircon cannot perform in an earlier slot than Yardsign. Hence, Yardsign cannot perform in slot 1. Similarly, if Yardsign performs in slot 2, then Zircon cannot perform in slot 1. Hence, Yardsign cannot perform in slot 2. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot 3. 
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon must perform in slot 1 or slot 2. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot 3 and must perform in slot 1 or slot 2. 
  If Zircon performs in slot 1 then Vegemite must perform in slot 2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Hence, Xpert must perform in slot 6. Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, it must perform in slot 4 or slot 5. Since Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, it must perform in slot 3. Therefore, if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 3.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - There are six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign cannot perform in slot one or two.
  
Process:
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign cannot perform in slot one or two.
  - Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot three.
  - From the constraints, Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Since Yardsign is in slot three, then Wellspring and Zircon must be in slots one and two, but we don't know which band is in which slot.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it can be in slots four, five, or six.
  - Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot two.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The slots must be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3 and Zircon must perform in slot 4 or 5. 
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Xpert must perform in slot 6. 
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it must perform in slot 4, 5, or 6. 
  - Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. We are given that Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.

Solution:
  From constraints 1 and 5, we know that Vegemite must perform in slot 1 and Zircon must perform in slot 6. 
  From constraint 2, we know that Wellspring must perform in either slot 2, 3, or 4. 
  From constraint 4, we know that Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, which means that Wellspring cannot perform in slots 1, 2 or 3. 
  From constraint 5, we know that Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which means that Yardsign must perform in slot 3. 
  Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot 4 or 5. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The six slots in the benefit concert must be filled by six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon cannot be in slot one and Yardsign cannot be in slot six.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon cannot be in slot one and Yardsign cannot be in slot six. 
  Therefore, Yardsign must be in either slot one, slot two, or slot three. 
  If Yardsign is in slot one or slot two, then Zircon must be in slot three or later, which means that Wellspring must be in slot two or earlier. 
  If Yardsign is in slot three, then Zircon must be in slot four or later, which means that Wellspring must be in slot four or earlier. 
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot four.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The slots are numbered 1 through 6, from earliest to latest.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3, and Zircon must perform in slot 2.
  
Process: 
  - If Yardsign performs in slot 3, then slots 1 and 2 must be filled by Vegemite and Zircon (in some order).
  - Wellspring and Xpert must perform in slots 4 and 5 (in some order).
  - Uneasy must perform in slot 6.
  - Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring can perform is slot 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band will perform in just one slot, and the slots are numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - We need to determine the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform, given that Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  
Analysis:
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3, which means that Uneasy must perform in either slot 4, 5, or 6.
  - Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, then Xpert must perform in either slot 5 or 6.
  - Therefore, if Uneasy performs in slot 4, then the order would be: Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, and Uneasy. This means that the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The slots are numbered 1-6, and each band performs only in one slot.
  Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Wellspring could perform in either slot two or slot three. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform, given the following constraints:
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  
  We know Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots. Therefore, Zircon must perform in one of the first three slots as well. However, Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Yardsign, so Zircon must perform in either slot one or slot two. If Zircon performs in slot one, then Vegemite must perform in slot two, and Wellspring must perform in slot three. If Zircon performs in slot two, then Vegemite must perform in slot one, and Wellspring must perform in slot three. Either way, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot three.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—will perform in just one slot each at a benefit concert. The slots are numbered 1 through 6.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Yardsign performs in slot 3, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots 1 or 2.
  - If Wellspring performs in slot 1, then Zircon must perform in slot 2 and Vegemite must perform in slot 3. This violates the constraint that Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot 2, Zircon must perform in slot 1, and Vegemite must perform in slot 3. This leaves slots 4, 5, and 6 for Uneasy, Xpert, and Yardsign.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment could be Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, and White.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then Tao must have been recruited second.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao must have been recruited fourth.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then Tao must have been recruited fifth.
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then Tao must have been recruited sixth.
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then Tao must have been recruited sixth.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then there are only two possible orders for the recruitment of Quinn, Rovero, and Tao: either Quinn was recruited first, then Tao, then Rovero, or Tao was recruited first, then Quinn, then Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero must have been recruited third, since Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Tao was recruited first, then Rovero must have been recruited second.
  
Analysis: 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then there are only two possible orders for the recruitment of Quinn, Rovero, and Tao: either Quinn was recruited first, then Tao, then Rovero, or Tao was recruited first, then Quinn, then Rovero. If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero must have been recruited third, since Peters was recruited fourth. If Tao was recruited first, then Rovero must have been recruited second. In either case, Stanton could not have been recruited first, second, third, or fifth. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited fifth, and Rovero must have been recruited sixth.
  
  Therefore, Stanton could not have been recruited immediately before or after Tao, who was recruited third. 
  
  This means that Stanton could not have been recruited fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  
  Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited either first, second, or seventh.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices from the first to the seventh is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, White]. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices from the first to the seventh is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, White]. 
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the accomplices from the first to the seventh is: [?, ?, ?, Peters, ?, ?, ?].
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of the accomplices from the first to the seventh is: [?, ?, Villas, Peters, ?, ?, White].
  According to the statement "Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao", the possible positions for Stanton are the first, second, fifth, and seventh.
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, then there are two possible cases: [Stanton, Tao] and [Tao, Stanton]. 

Action: Answer("D")  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited fifth. Therefore, the answer is (D) fifth.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of these two is fixed.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Stanton must have been recruited either first, second, third, fifth, or sixth.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of these two is fixed. Therefore, the possible orders of Peters, Quinn, and Rovero are: PQ-R, RQ-P.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so the possible orders involving Stanton are: 
  1. Stanton must have been recruited before Tao: S--T
  2. Stanton must have been recruited after Tao: T--S
  
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero and the order is PQ-R, then either Stanton was recruited first or second. If Stanton was recruited first, then it would be impossible to satisfy the condition that Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited second, and Villas must have been recruited sixth. The remaining order is: S-Q-P-R-T-V-W. This order satisfies all of the given conditions.
  
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero and the order is RQ-P, then either Stanton was recruited fifth or seventh. If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the only possible order is: V-W-S-T-Q-R-P, which does not satisfy the condition that Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited seventh, and the only possible order is: V-W-T-S-Q-R-P. This order does not satisfy the condition that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited first or fifth. The possible orders for Stanton are second, third, or sixth.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  There are seven accomplices in total.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited either second or third.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited either second or third.
  If Stanton was recruited first, second, or third, then Stanton could have been recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao, which contradicts the established information that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited first, second, or third.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Stanton must have been recruited either fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the seven accomplices would be:
  1. Peters
  2. Quinn
  3. Rovero
  4. ?
  5. ?
  6. Villas
  7. White
  
Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton must be recruited either third, fifth, or seventh.

  1. Stanton
  2. Peters
  3. Quinn
  4. Rovero
  5. ?
  6. Villas
  7. White

However, this violates the condition that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, Stanton CANNOT have been recruited first.

If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of the seven accomplices would be:
  1. Peters
  2. Stanton
  3. Quinn
  4. Rovero
  5. ?
  6. Villas
  7. White
  
This is a valid order that satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, Stanton COULD have been recruited second.

If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of the seven accomplices would be:
  1. Peters
  2. Quinn
  3. Stanton
  4. Rovero
  5. ?
  6. Villas
  7. White
  
This is also a valid order that satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, Stanton COULD have been recruited third.

If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of the seven accomplices would be:
  1. Peters
  2. Quinn
  3. Rovero
  4. ?
  5. Stanton
  6. Villas
  7. White
  
This violates the condition that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Stanton CANNOT have been recruited fifth.

If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of the seven accomplices would be:
  1. Peters
  2. Quinn
  3. Rovero
  4. ?
  5. Villas

  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices would be Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, and Stanton. In this order, Stanton would have been recruited fifth.
  
  A: We don't know if Stanton was recruited first or not.
  B: We don't know if Stanton was recruited second or not.
  C: We don't know if Stanton was recruited third or not.
  D: Stanton was not recruited fifth as this is the position of Tao in the order.
  E: We don't know if Stanton was recruited seventh or not.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the first four recruits is: __ __ __ Peters __ __ __ __. 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. So, the order of Quinn and Rovero can be: __ __ Quinn __ Rovero __ __ __ or __ __ __ Quinn __ Rovero __ __. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White. So, the order of Villas and White can be: __ __ __ __ Villas White __ __ or __ __ __ __ __ Villas White __. 
  We know that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. So, Tao should be recruited either before Stanton or after Stanton. 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of Quinn and Rovero can be: __ __ Quinn Rovero __ __ __ or __ __ __ Quinn Rovero __ __. 
  Therefore, the possible orders of Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Tao, and Stanton are:
  1. Peters Quinn Rovero Villas White Tao Stanton

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Each member of the band performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
To determine the answer, we can start with the given condition that the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does. Given this condition, we can deduce that the saxophonist must perform either fourth, fifth or sixth solo. In any of these scenarios, the violinist must perform before the saxophonist. Therefore, C is not necessarily true. 

Knowledge:
  - The percussionist performs before the saxophonist.
  - The saxophonist performs fourth, fifth or sixth solo.
  
Option A is not correct, because it is possible that the percussionist does not perform the first solo. Option B is not correct, because it is possible that the percussionist does not perform the second solo. Option D is not correct, because it is possible that the percussionist performs a solo after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the correct answer is E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Six members of the band perform a solo exactly once.
  - Guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - Percussionist performs a solo before keyboard player does.
  - Keyboard player performs a solo after violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - Saxophonist performs a solo after percussionist does or after the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist performs solo after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the percussionist solo must be either first, second, or third. If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist would perform the solo after the trumpeter does, which would be the last solo. This violates the given conditions. Therefore, the percussionist does not perform the first solo. Similarly, if the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist would perform the last solo, which again violates the given conditions. Therefore, the percussionist performs the third solo. Now, the saxophonist must perform the fifth solo, and the violinist, who performs a solo before the saxophonist, must perform the fourth solo. This means the keyboard player performs the sixth and the last solo. The only option that is consistent with this is D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then it is possible that the saxophonist performs a solo after the trumpeter does, but not before the percussionist does. Therefore, it must be true that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band, and each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform after the trumpeter. Thus, the percussionist must perform before the trumpeter. Therefore, D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does must be true.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Each member of the band performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  In this scenario, we know that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does. 

Analysis:
  - If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist cannot perform a solo after the percussionist does. This contradicts the given information. Hence, option A is not correct.
  - If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist can perform a solo after the percussionist does. This option is possible, but we cannot confirm it yet. Hence, we cannot select option B as the answer.
  - If the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then it could be possible, but we cannot confirm it yet. Hence, we cannot select option C as the answer.
  - If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does, then it could be possible, but we cannot confirm it yet. Hence, we cannot select option D as the answer.
  - If the saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does, then we cannot confirm it yet. Hence, we cannot select option E as the answer.
  
From the above analysis, we can see that options B, C, D, and E are possible, but we cannot confirm any of them yet. Hence, we cannot select any option as the answer. Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Six-member band gives a concert.
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - Restrictions:
    - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
    - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
    - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
    
Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist. According to the restrictions, the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the percussionist must perform a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. Thus, the correct answer is D.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are six members in the band, and each performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Solution:
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then there are two possibilities:
  1. The percussionist performs the first solo, and the saxophonist performs the last solo.
  2. The percussionist performs the second solo, and the saxophonist performs the last solo.
  In either case, the violinist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, so (C) is not true. The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, so (E) is not true. If the percussionist performs the first solo, then (B) and (D) are not true. Therefore, if the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the percussionist performs the second solo. Answer: (B)
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band, and each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Action: 
  First, we need to determine the possible order of the solos based on the given restrictions:
  1. The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  2. The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  3. The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  4. The guitarist performs fourth.
  
  If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist must perform fifth or sixth. This means that the percussionist must perform either first, second, or third. However, we cannot determine the exact order of the first three solos based on the given restrictions. Therefore, none of the choices A, B, C, D, or E must be true.
  
  Answer: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  A six-member band gives a concert where each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform a solo before the trumpeter does. So, D is the correct option, which states that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are six members in the band.
  Each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

We are given that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
Action: Answer("D")  
If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, and we know that the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both, then the percussionist must perform a solo before the trumpeter. Therefore, the correct answer is D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A naturalist will give five lectures, each on a different type of bird: oystercatchers, petrels, rails, sandpipers, or terns. The lectures must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium, in an order that meets the following conditions: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Elimination:
  A: This could be true. The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, but the second lecture could also be in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: This could be true. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so the second and third lectures could be in Howard Auditorium.
  C: This could be true. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium, and the lecture on oystercatchers must be after the lecture on sandpipers, which means it could also be in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on terns is earlier than the lecture on petrels, which means the lecture on petrels must be later than the lecture on terns and could also be in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: This could be true. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so the third lecture could also be in Howard Auditorium.
  E: This must be false. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium, which means the lecture on oystercatchers must be after the lecture on sandpipers and must be in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on terns is earlier than the lecture on petrels, which means the lecture on petrels must be later than the lecture on terns and must be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the third and fifth lectures cannot both be in Gladwyn Hall.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  2. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  3. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  4. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  5. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

A: If the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, then the second lecture cannot also be in Gladwyn Hall since exactly three of the lectures must be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, A can be true.
B: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so the second and third lectures cannot both be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, B must be false.
C: The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. Therefore, oystercatchers must be given in Gladwyn Hall, and since Gladwyn Hall already has three lectures, the lecture on petrels must also be given in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, the second and fifth lectures cannot both be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, C must be false.
D: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so the third lecture cannot also be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, D can be true.
E: The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium, so the lecture on oystercatchers must be given in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lecture on terns must be given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the third and fifth lectures cannot both be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, E can be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
  A: It is possible for the first and second lectures to both be in Gladwyn Hall because the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and there are five lectures. Therefore, the second lecture could also be in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: It is possible for the second and third lectures to both be in Howard Auditorium because the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium and there are five lectures. Therefore, the second and third lectures could both be in Howard Auditorium.
  C: It is possible for the second and fifth lectures to both be in Gladwyn Hall because the first, third, and fourth lectures are already assigned to Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium. Therefore, the second and fifth lectures could both be in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: It is possible for the third and fourth lectures to both be in Howard Auditorium because the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium and there are five lectures. Therefore, the third and fourth lectures could both be in Howard Auditorium.
  E: It is NOT possible for the third and fifth lectures to both be in Gladwyn Hall because the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. Therefore, the lecture on oystercatchers cannot be the third lecture if the lecture on sandpipers is the fifth lecture.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
Solution:
  If the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers, then oystercatchers must be in Gladwyn Hall. This means that exactly two of the other lectures must also be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lectures on petrels and terns must be in Howard Auditorium. Since the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, it must be the lecture on petrels. Therefore, the lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which means it is the second lecture in Howard Auditorium. This leaves the lecture on rails as the only lecture left for Gladwyn Hall, and the lecture on sandpipers as the third lecture in Howard Auditorium.
  
  A: The first two lectures must be in different halls. Therefore, this must be false.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium, which is possible according to the conditions. Therefore, this may be true.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall, which is not possible according to the conditions. Therefore, this must be false.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium, which is not possible according to the conditions. Therefore, this must be false.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall, which is not possible according to the conditions. Therefore, this must be false.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
Analysis:
  If the second lecture is in Howard Auditorium, then the third lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall, because exactly three lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. This means that the lecture on terns must be the first lecture, which contradicts the fact that the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, B must be true. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  - The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Let's check each option:
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
     This is possible, since only the first lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall.
     Therefore, this option is not necessarily false.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
     This is possible, since only the fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium.
     Therefore, this option is not necessarily false.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
     This is not possible, since exactly three of the lectures must be in Gladwyn Hall,
     and we already know that the first, fourth, and either the second or fifth lectures are not in Gladwyn Hall.
     Therefore, this option must be false.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
     This is not possible, since the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers,
     which means that the lecture on oystercatchers is not in Howard Auditorium.
     Therefore, this option must be false.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
     This is not possible, since exactly three of the lectures must be in Gladwyn Hall,
     and we already know that the first, fourth, and either the second or fifth lectures are not in Gladwyn Hall.
     Therefore, this option must be false.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  3. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  5. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Based on condition 3, Franz's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil (wall 4). Therefore, Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 4. Based on condition 4, Greene's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil (wall 1). Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor (wall 1). Based on condition 2, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than Hidalgo's oil. Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 4 walls in the exhibition room, with 2 paintings (1 oil and 1 watercolor) on each wall (1 oil and 1 watercolor painting per student).
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  - Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, that means Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 (because no wall can have only watercolors from one student). 
  - Also, since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2 (because Hidalgo's oil is already on wall 2). 
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed on the wall where Franz's oil is displayed (according to the condition). Therefore, Greene's oil can be displayed on wall 2 (because no wall can have only the work of one student displayed on it). 
  - Hence, the answer is C.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The exhibition room has four walls and each wall has one painting in the upper position and one painting in the lower position.
  Each of the four art students display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor can be on wall 1, 3, or 4.
  A: Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2 because no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  B: Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 because it is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  C: Greene's oil can be on wall 2 because it does not violate any of the given conditions.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 because it would violate the condition "No wall has only watercolors displayed on it".
  E: Isaacs's watercolor can be on wall 2 because it does not violate any of the given conditions.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students who will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  We are asked to determine which painting could also be displayed on wall 2 if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Logic:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then wall 2 must have one oil and one watercolor.
  Since Hidalgo has already displayed his oil on wall 2, he must have displayed his watercolor on another wall.
  No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, so the other student who displayed a painting on wall 2 must have displayed an oil on wall 2.
  According to the given conditions, no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  Therefore, the only option left is Hidalgo's watercolor, which could also be displayed on wall 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students who will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we know that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2, since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. We also know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither of their paintings can be displayed on wall 2. This leaves us with Greene's oil and watercolor. We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so if Hidalgo's oil is on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor could be displayed on wall 2 in the lower position. Therefore, the answer is B: Greene's watercolor.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Hidalgo's oil is on wall 2.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Using condition 2, 3, and 4, we can deduce that each wall has the work of exactly two students. Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on one of the other walls.

Using condition 5, we know that Franz's oil is displayed on a wall with Greene's watercolor. Therefore, Franz's watercolor must be displayed on one of the other walls.

Using condition 6, we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on one of the other walls.

We can now deduce that the only student left to be paired with Hidalgo is Isaacs.

So, we have:
  Wall 1: Franz watercolor, Greene oil
  Wall 2: Hidalgo oil, Isaacs watercolor
  Wall 3: Greene watercolor, Franz oil
  Wall 4: Isaacs oil, Hidalgo watercolor

Knowledge:
  A: Franz's oil is displayed on Wall 1, so it cannot be displayed on Wall 2.
  B: Greene's watercolor is displayed on Wall 1 and Wall 3, so it cannot be displayed on Wall 2.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed on Wall 1 and Wall 4, so it cannot be displayed on Wall 2.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on Wall 4, so it cannot be displayed on Wall 2.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on Wall 2, so it could also be displayed on Wall 2.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Each student displays exactly one oil and one watercolor painting.
  2. Exactly two paintings are displayed on each wall.
  3. One painting is displayed in the upper position and the other in the lower position of each wall.
  4. No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  5. No wall can have only one student's work displayed on it.
  6. Wall 4 has Isaacs's oil in the lower position.
  7. Wall with Hidalgo's oil cannot have a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  
Reasoning:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then either Franz's oil or Greene's watercolor must also be displayed on wall 2. 
  Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 because it would violate condition 4. 
  Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because it would violate condition 5. 
  Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because it would violate condition 1. 
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Franz's oil is displayed on wall 2. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  3. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  5. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we know that wall 2 has one oil painting and one watercolor painting. Since no wall can have only watercolors, we know that one of the paintings on wall 2 must be an oil painting. We also know that no wall can have only the work of one student displayed on it, so the other painting on wall 2 cannot be another Hidalgo painting. This eliminates options D and E. We also know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so option A is also eliminated since it is Franz's oil painting. This leaves us with options B and C. According to condition 4, if Franz's oil is displayed on a wall, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of that wall. Therefore, if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 must be Greene's oil painting. Therefore, the answer is C: Greene's oil. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Each student has one oil and one watercolor painting.
  - Each wall has one oil and one watercolor painting.
  - No wall has only watercolors.
  - No wall has the work of only one student.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the watercolor painting on wall 2 cannot be by Hidalgo. This means that either Greene or Isaacs must have their watercolor painting on wall 2.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Greene's watercolor is on wall 2, then Franz's oil must be on wall 1. However, this would mean that wall 1 has only watercolors displayed on it, which is not allowed. Therefore, Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 2.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on wall 2. 
  
  This means that Hidalgo's watercolor must be on wall 2, and the oil painting on wall 2 must be by either Franz, Greene, or Isaacs.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  From the context, we know that:
  - Each of the four walls will display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo cannot have his watercolor on wall 2. Also, no other painting from Hidalgo can be on wall 2. Franz cannot have his oil on wall 2 as he shares a wall with Isaacs. Therefore, the only possible painting that can also be on wall 2 is Greene's oil because it shares a wall with Franz's oil.

  - A: Bay 2 cannot be holding fuel because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - B: Bay 4 could be holding produce because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel and is next to the bay holding textiles.
  - C: Bay 4 cannot be holding textiles because the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - D: Bay 5 could be holding grain because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - E: Bay 5 could be holding machinery because there is no rule that prohibits it from doing so.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The bays are numbered consecutively from 1 to 6.
  - There are 6 types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  - Grain > Livestock > Textiles
  - Produce > Fuel
  - Textiles is next to Produce
  - Produce is next to Livestock
  
Analysis:
  - If Produce is next to Livestock, then Livestock must be in Bay 3 or Bay 4, and Produce must be in Bay 4 or Bay 5.
  - If Bay 4 is holding Produce, then Textiles must be in Bay 3 or Bay 5.
  - If Bay 4 is holding Textiles, then Produce must be in Bay 3 or Bay 5.
  - If Bay 2 is holding Fuel, then Produce must be in Bay 5, and Livestock must be in Bay 3.

  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

To answer this question, we need to find an option that cannot be true if the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock. 

Analysis:
  - If bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then it means that one of the two bays is bay 3. 
  - We know that the bay holding livestock must have a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 1 or 2.
  - We also know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, the bay holding produce cannot be bay 5 or 6.

A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. -> This could be true. 
B: Bay 4 is holding produce. -> This could be true if the bay holding livestock is bay 3.
C: Bay 4 is holding textiles. -> This could be true if the bay holding produce is bay 3.
D: Bay 5 is holding grain. -> This could be true if the bay holding livestock is bay 3 and the bay holding produce is bay 4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies showing at the theater: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Three screens are available: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must be shown before the sci-fi film since the western begins before the horror film. Therefore, the western will be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2, and the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3. 
  This means that one of the movies on screen 3 must be the horror, mystery, or romance.
  The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 3.
  The horror and mystery must be shown on screens 1 and 2, but it is not clear which is shown on which screen.
  The mystery must begin at either 7 P.M. or 9 P.M. since it cannot be shown on the same screen as the horror film.
  
Action: Answer("B") - The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. The western begins before the horror film.
  2. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  3. The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  4. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
Analysis:
  - If the western and sci-fi are shown on the same screen, they must be shown on screen 1 or 2 because the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 1 if the western and sci-fi are shown on screen 2, and vice versa.
  - Since the horror and mystery cannot be shown on the same screen, and the western is shown before the horror, the western must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2 with the sci-fi. Therefore, the horror must be shown on screen 3.
  - The mystery can only be shown on screen 1 or screen 2, and it cannot be shown with the horror film. Therefore, if the western and sci-fi are shown on screen 2, the mystery must be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Western movie starts before the horror movie.
  2. Sci-Fi movie is not shown on screen 3.
  3. Romance movie is not shown on screen 2.
  4. Horror and mystery movies are shown on different screens.
  5. Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.

To check the options:
  A: It is not possible because the horror movie cannot be shown on screen 2.
  B: It is possible as long as the mystery is not shown on screen 2.
  C: It is not possible because the romance movie cannot be shown on screen 2 and it is not shown on screen 3.
  D: It is not possible because the sci-fi movie is not shown at 7 P.M.
  E: It is possible as long as the western movie is the only movie shown on screen 3.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.

To answer this question, we need to deduce which options could be true if the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen.

If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen, then they must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2. 

If the western begins at 7 P.M. on screen 1, then the sci-fi film must also be shown on screen 1 since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. This means that the horror film must be shown on screen 2, which violates the condition that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the western cannot begin at 7 P.M. on screen 1.

If the western begins at 9 P.M. on screen 1, then the sci-fi film must also be shown on screen 1 since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. This means that the mystery must be shown on screen 2, and the horror film must be shown on screen 3. The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1. Therefore, we know that the mystery begins at 9 P.M. on screen 2, and the romance and the western begin at 7 P.M. on screen 1. 

If the western begins at 7 P.M. on screen 2, then the sci-fi film must also be shown on screen 2 since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. This means that the horror film must be shown on screen 1, which violates the condition that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the western cannot begin at 7 P.M. on screen 2.

If the western begins at 9 P.M. on screen 2, then the sci-fi film must also be shown on screen 2 since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. This means that the mystery must be shown on screen 1, and the horror film must be shown on screen 3. The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1. Therefore, we know that the mystery begins at 9 P.M. on screen 1, and the romance and the western begin at 7 P.M. on screen 2. 

Therefore, the only option that could be true of this evening's schedule if the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen is Option B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
- Western begins before horror film
- Sci-fi is not shown on screen 3
- Romance is not shown on screen 2
- Horror film and mystery are shown on different screens
- Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.

Assumption:
- If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then they are not shown on screen 3.

Analysis:
- If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen, they can only be shown on screen 1 or 2, since sci-fi is not shown on screen 3.
- Romance is not shown on screen 2, so it can only be shown on screen 1 or 3.
- Horror and mystery are shown on different screens, so they can only be shown on screens 1, 2, or 3.

Answer:
If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possible option is that the western begins at 7 P.M. on screen 1 and the sci-fi film begins at 9 P.M. on screen 1. Therefore, the mystery cannot be on screen 1 or the horror film will be on the same screen, and the romance cannot be on screen 1, so it must be on screen 3. Thus, the answer is C: The romance is shown on screen 3. Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Three screens are available: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possible screens are screen 1 and screen 2, since the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3. 
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1 or screen 2, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on the remaining screen. 
  The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 3.

Action: Answer("B") 
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1, then the horror film and the mystery are shown on screen 2. Therefore, the mystery could begin at 9 P.M. (choice B) and the other choices are not possible.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are three screens at the repertory theater and each movie is shown exactly once. 
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must be shown before 8 P.M. 
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so neither one can be shown on the same screen as the western and the sci-fi film.

A: The horror film is shown on screen 2. - This cannot be true because the mystery is shown on a different screen than the horror film.
B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M. - This cannot be true because the mystery and the horror film are shown on different screens.
C: The romance is shown on screen 3. - This cannot be true because the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M. - This cannot be true because the western must be shown before 8 P.M.
E: The western begins at 8 P.M. - This cannot be true because the western must be shown before the horror film does.

Therefore, none of the options could be true, and the answer is "None of the Above".
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  There are three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.

  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must begin before the sci-fi film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they must be shown on screens 1 and 2.

Action: Answer("D") 
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must begin before the sci-fi film. Therefore, the western must begin at 7 P.M. on screen 1 or 2 and the sci-fi film must begin at 7 P.M. on the other screen. So, the statement "The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M." could be true.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - There are three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.

  - The western starts before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not on screen 3.
  - The romance is not on screen 2.
  - The horror and mystery are on different screens.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must be on screen 1 or 2, and the sci-fi film must be on screen 1 or 2. We know that the sci-fi film is not on screen 3, so it must be on screen 1 or 2 with the western. Therefore, the horror film and the mystery must be on the remaining screen that does not have the western and the sci-fi film.

  A: The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 since the romance is not shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery cannot begin at 9 P.M. since the horror and mystery are shown on different screens.
  C: The romance cannot be shown on screen 3 since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.

    - The western must be shown on screen 1 or 2 (because it starts before the horror film).
    - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
    - The romance cannot be shown on screen 2.
    - The horror film and mystery are shown on different screens, so it is not possible for the horror film to be shown on screen 1 or 2 with the western.
    - Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film must both be shown on screen 1 or both be shown on screen 2.

Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: Which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one?
Choices:
  A: Yardsign
  B: Vegemite, Wellspring
  C: Vegemite, Yardsign
  D: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign
  E: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, Zircon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find out which bands could be in slot one.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it could be in slot one.
  Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, so if Zircon is in any slot other than one, Vegemite could be in slot one.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so if Xpert is in any slot other than one, Wellspring and Zircon could be in slot one.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it cannot be in slot one.
  
Analysis:
  Yardsign is an option for slot one.
  If Zircon is not in slot one, Vegemite can be in slot one with Wellspring.
  If Xpert is not in slot one, Wellspring and Zircon can be in slot one with Vegemite.
  Therefore, the options are Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The order of the bands must meet the following constraints:
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

To determine which bands could perform in slot one, we need to look at the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. That means Yardsign could perform in slot one. Additionally, since Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Wellspring and Zircon must each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, none of those three bands could perform in slot one. This leaves Uneasy as a possibility, but we are looking for a complete and accurate list of bands, so we need to consider the possibility of more than one band. Since Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, and slot one is one of the first three slots, it follows that any band that could perform in slot one must also be a band that is not excluded from performing in the first three slots. The only bands that are not excluded from performing in the first three slots are Yardsign, Vegemite, and Wellspring. Therefore, the complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one is Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Slot one must be filled by one of the bands that will perform in the first three slots.
  Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  
Elimination:
  A: Yardsign could perform in slot one, but there are other bands that could perform in slot one.
  B: Vegemite and Wellspring could perform in slot one, but there are other bands that could perform in slot one.
  C: Vegemite and Yardsign could perform in slot one, but there are other bands that could perform in slot one.
  D: This is a possible list of bands that could perform in slot one, as it includes Yardsign, Vegemite and Wellspring.
  E: This list includes all the bands, but it is not a complete list of bands that could perform in slot one.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it could be in slot one.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite could be in slot one.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so neither Wellspring nor Zircon could be in slot one.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it could not be in slot one.
  
Eliminating the bands that cannot perform in slot one, the possible bands are Yardsign and Vegemite. Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it could be the band that performs in slot one.
- Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Zircon cannot perform in slot one.
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Xpert cannot perform in slot one.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it cannot perform in slot one.
- Therefore, the only bands that could perform in slot one are Yardsign, Vegemite, and Wellspring.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the six bands must meet the following constraints:
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  We need to find a list of bands that could be the band that performs in slot one.
  Slot one is the earliest slot, so the band that performs in slot one cannot be Xpert or Uneasy.
  We need to find a list of bands that satisfies all the constraints and includes at least one band that can perform in slot one.
Analysis:
  A: Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it could perform in slot one. However, we don't know if there are any other bands that could perform in slot one.
  B: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Vegemite and Wellspring could perform in slot one. This option is a possible answer.
  C: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so either of these bands could perform in slot one. However, there are no other bands in this list, so this option is not valid.
  D: This list includes all the bands from option B and adds Yardsign. Therefore, this option is also a possible answer.
  E: This list includes all the bands from option D and adds Zircon. However, Zircon cannot perform in slot one because it performs in a later slot than Wellspring and Vegemite. Therefore, this option is not valid.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The band that performs in slot one must be one of the bands that can perform in the first three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The six slots at a benefit concert are numbered slot one through slot six.
  The six bands are Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  Each band will perform in just one slot.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  We need to find a list of bands that could perform in slot one.

Solution:
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it could be the band that performs in slot one.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite could perform in slot one.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Wellspring could perform in slot one along with Vegemite.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one is Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  To perform in slot one, a band must be one of the first three bands to perform, so it must be one of Yardsign, Vegemite, or Wellspring.
  Zircon cannot perform in slot one because it must perform in a later slot than Vegemite and Wellspring.
  Xpert cannot perform in slot one because both Wellspring and Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, so it cannot perform in slot one.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  In slot one, the band that performs must be one of the bands that can perform in the first three slots.
  The bands that can perform in the first three slots are Yardsign, Vegemite, and Wellspring.
  Zircon cannot perform in slot one, since Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.

Elimination:
  A: Yardsign could perform in slot one, but there are other bands that could perform in the first slot as well.
  B: This option includes Vegemite and Wellspring, which are two of the three bands that can perform in the first slot, so this is a possibility. However, there could be other bands that can perform in the first slot as well.
  C: This option includes Vegemite and Yardsign, but it is missing Wellspring, which is also a band that can perform in the first slot.
  D: This option includes Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign, which are all three bands that can perform in the first slot, so this is a possibility.
  E: This option includes Zircon, which cannot perform in the first slot, since Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Each shelf has at least two books.
  
If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H is on the top shelf and L is on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O is on the top shelf and L is on the middle shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, it means that K and F are on the bottom shelf. Therefore, G, H and M are on the top shelf. Based on this arrangement, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("C") H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly eight books are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, we know that L cannot be on the bottom shelf. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf, H must be on the top shelf. Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf or the bottom shelf. However, we know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be on the middle shelf. Therefore, L must be on the bottom shelf. Based on this, we can conclude that K must also be on the bottom shelf, since K is placed on a higher shelf than F. This leaves only one spot on the bottom shelf, so M and F must be on the middle shelf. Finally, G and I must be on the top shelf.
  
  A: We don't know where F and G are placed, so we cannot say if they are on the same shelf as each other.
  B: We don't know where G and H are placed, so we cannot say if they are on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H is on the top shelf and M is on the middle shelf, so they cannot be on the same shelf as each other.
  D: We don't know where G and I are placed, so we cannot say if they are on the same shelf as each other.
  E: We know that K is on the bottom shelf and O is on a higher shelf than L, but we don't know where O is placed, so we cannot say if K and O are on the same shelf as each other.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf. Since F and M are on the same shelf, they cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf. Since I is also on the middle shelf, G must be on the top shelf. This leaves K and O to be on the bottom shelf. Thus, the only answer choice that must be true is that H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then either L is on the top shelf and H is on the middle or bottom shelf, or L is on the middle shelf and H is on the bottom shelf. In either case, neither H nor L can be on the same shelf as F or K. Therefore, the only option that could be true is:
  Answer("D") I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly eight books are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between L and H, and determine which answer choice must be true if L is placed on a higher shelf than H.

Action: Answer("B")  

Explanation: 
If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, L must be on the middle or top shelf. However, O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be on the top shelf. Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf and I must be on the top shelf. This means that G and H must be on the same shelf, as they are the only books remaining that can be placed together. We do not have enough information to determine the placement of F and M, or the placement of K and O, so answer choices A, C, D, and E are not necessarily true. Therefore, the correct answer is B, which states that G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: 
  - If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - If L is on the middle shelf, then O must be on the top shelf since O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - If O is on the top shelf, then K must be on the middle shelf since K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - If K is on the middle shelf, then I must be on the bottom shelf since I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - If I is on the bottom shelf, then G and H must be on the middle shelf since each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - Therefore, the answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - There are exactly three shelves.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - We know nothing about the placement of G.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, then M must be on the bottom shelf. Thus, H and M cannot be placed on the same shelf. That leaves only one option, which is that H and M are placed on the same shelf. Therefore, C is the correct answer.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books placed on 3 shelves.
  - There are at least 2 books on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then it means that L must be either on the top shelf or on the middle shelf, and H must be on the bottom shelf. This also means that at least 4 books are on the bottom shelf, since there are more books on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. 

A: There is no information about the placement of F and G relative to each other, so this choice cannot be determined.
B: There is no information about the placement of G and H relative to each other, so this choice cannot be determined.
C: There is no information that links H and M together, so this choice cannot be determined.
D: There is no information that links I and G together, so this choice cannot be determined.
E: Since K is already placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, it is not possible for K and O to be placed on the same shelf. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and there are only three shelves, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the top shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, G and H must be on the bottom shelf. Thus, G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. Therefore, the answer is (B) G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. Answer("B").
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf
  - I is on the middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M
  
  We are asked to determine what must be true if L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  
  If L is on a higher shelf than H, then we know that H is either on the top or middle shelf, and L is either on the top or middle shelf.
  
  If H is on the top shelf, then L is also on the top shelf, which means that more books are on the top shelf than the bottom shelf, which contradicts the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. Therefore, H is on the middle shelf.
  
  If L is on the top shelf, then F and M must also be on the top shelf since F is on the same shelf as M. This means that there are at least three books on the top shelf (F, L, and M), which contradicts the condition that at least two books are on each shelf. Therefore, L is on the middle shelf.
  
  If L is on the middle shelf and H is on the top shelf, then G must be on the bottom shelf since there are at least two books on each shelf. This means that F and K are on the middle shelf, and O is on the bottom shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the middle shelf and F must be on the top shelf. This leaves only I to be placed on the bottom shelf, which means that I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  
  Therefore, the answer is (D) I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: The assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  E: Xu is assigned parking space #5.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The employees are Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
- The parking spaces are #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
- Each employee must be assigned a different parking space.
- Young's parking space number > Togowa's parking space number.
- Xu's parking space number > Souza's parking space number.
- Robertson's parking space is #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
- Robertson's parking space is #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza, Togowa, and Vaughn must be assigned parking spaces #1, #2, and #3 in some order. Thus, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
  The first rule is that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. This means that Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6, and Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  The second rule is that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This means that Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  The third rule is that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. This means that Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Young cannot be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3.
  The fourth rule is that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Solution:
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, Souza must be assigned parking space #3, Togowa must be assigned parking space #2, and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #1. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4. 
  Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  If Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, then we can arrange the parking spaces from left to right as Robertson's space, then either (a) #2, #3, #4, #5, #6 or (b) #1, #2, #3, #4, #5. If we start with (a), then we know that Robertson is assigned either parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. We know that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4. If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, which is not possible because Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4, which means that Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Togowa must be assigned parking space #1. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #6 and Souza must be assigned parking space #2. Finally, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #3. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, Souza must be assigned parking space #2, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #3. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are six employees and six parking spaces, so each employee must be assigned a different parking space.
- The following rules must be followed:
  - Young's parking space > Togowa's parking space
  - Xu's parking space > Souza's parking space
  - Robertson's parking space > Young's parking space
  - Robertson's parking space = #1, #2, #3, or #4

Analysis:
- Since Robertson's parking space must be #1, #2, #3, or #4, we can start by considering each of these cases:
  - If Robertson's parking space is #1, then Young's parking space must be #2, and Togowa's parking space must be #3. Then, Xu's parking space must be #6, Souza's parking space must be #5, and Vaughn's parking space can be either #4 or #6. Therefore, this case does not fully and uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces.
  - If Robertson's parking space is #2, then Young's parking space must be #3, and Togowa's parking space must be #4. Then, Xu's parking space must be #6, Souza's parking space must be #5, and Vaughn's parking space must be #1. Therefore, this case fully and uniquely determines the assignment of parking spaces.
  - If Robertson's parking space is #3, then Young's parking space must be #4, and Togowa's parking space must be #5. Then, Xu's parking space must be #6, Souza's parking space must be #2, and Vaughn's parking space must be #1. Therefore, this case fully and uniquely determines the assignment of parking spaces.
  - If Robertson's parking space is #4, then Young's parking space must be #5, and Togowa's parking space must be #6. Then, Xu's parking space must be #3, Souza's parking space must be #2, and Vaughn's parking space must be #1. Therefore, this case fully and uniquely determines the assignment of parking spaces.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The six employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young) must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
- No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
- Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
- Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
- Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
- We know that Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young must each be assigned one of the parking spaces #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
- We know the assignments for Robertson, Young, Xu, and Togowa. The remaining parking spaces, #2 and #3, must be assigned to Souza and Vaughn, but it is not clear which employee will get which parking space.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. 
  Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. 
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: 
    - Young > Togowa
    - Xu > Souza
    - Robertson > Young
    - Robertson ∈ {#1, #2, #3, #4}
    
A: If Souza is assigned parking space #1, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, this choice is not valid.
B: If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #1. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Young > Togowa, so Togowa must be assigned parking space #3 or #4. This leaves Vaughn, who must be assigned the remaining parking space. Therefore, this choice is valid.
C: If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Xu must be assigned parking space #6. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, and Young > Togowa, so Togowa must be assigned parking space #2. This leaves Souza, who must be assigned parking space #4 or #5. Therefore, this choice is not valid.
D: If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5. Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #2. This leaves Togowa and Vaughn, who must be assigned parking spaces #1 and #3, respectively. Therefore, this choice is valid.
E: If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza must be assigned parking space #2. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, and Young > Togowa, so Togowa must be assigned parking space #3. This leaves Vaughn and Young, who must be assigned parking spaces #4 and #6, respectively. Therefore, this choice is not valid.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, according to the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Then, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, according to the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Finally, Souza and Togowa must be assigned parking spaces #1 and #2, respectively, according to the remaining rules. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 employees to be assigned to 6 different parking spaces.
  Robertson must be assigned space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Robertson must be assigned space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Robertson is assigned space #4, then Young must be assigned space #5, Togowa must be assigned space #6, Xu must be assigned space #3, Souza must be assigned space #2, and Vaughn must be assigned space #1. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, Souza must be assigned parking space #3, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #2, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #1. All of the rules are satisfied and the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - We need at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist on the panel.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Analysis:
  If both G and H are selected, then we need to determine which other scientist(s) must be selected to satisfy the given conditions. 
  - If we select both G and H, we have already satisfied the condition of having at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist on the panel.
  - The condition "If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected" means that we cannot select more than one botanist and one zoologist at the same time. Since we have already selected two botanists (G and H), we cannot select any zoologist.
  - The condition "F and K cannot both be selected" means that if we select F, we cannot select K. Therefore, we need to select either F or K (but not both).
  - The condition "K and M cannot both be selected" means that if we select K, we cannot select M. Therefore, we need to select either K or M (but not both).
  - The condition "If M is selected, both P and R must be selected" means that if we select M, we must also select both P and R.

Solution:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we need to select one more scientist to form the panel. We cannot select any zoologist because we have already selected two botanists. Therefore, we must select either F or K (but not both) and either M or P and R. 
  - If we select F, we cannot select K. Therefore, we must select M and both P and R. 
  - If we select K, we cannot select M. Therefore, we must select F and either P or R. 
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K. 
  Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected:
    Either F or K must be selected since there must be at least one botanist.
    If F is not selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, so either K or M must be selected since there must be at least one chemist.
    If K is selected, then at most one botanist can be selected, so either M or one of the zoologists P or R must be selected.
    If M is selected, then both P and R must also be selected, so no other scientist can be selected.
    
Analysis:
  If both G and H are selected, then either F or K must be selected due to the requirement of having at least one botanist. If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected due to the requirement of having at least one chemist and at most one zoologist. If K is selected, then either M or one of the zoologists P or R must be selected due to the requirement of having at least one botanist. If M is selected, then both P and R must also be selected, so no other scientist can be selected.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so there must be at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Solution:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we need to consider the possible combinations of the remaining scientists that satisfy the given conditions:
  
  Case 1: One botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist are selected.
    In this case, we can only select one botanist, and the only botanist left is F. We cannot select K as it cannot be selected with F. Therefore, we must select either M or L as the chemist, and we must select either P and R or Q as the zoologist. This case does not satisfy any of the choices.
    
  Case 2: Two botanists, one chemist, and one zoologist are selected.
    In this case, we must select F as one of the botanists. We cannot select K as it cannot be selected with F. Therefore, we must select either G or H as the other botanist. We cannot select both P and R as they can only be selected if M is selected, which is not possible in this case. Therefore, we must select either Q or P as the zoologist. We must select either L or M as the chemist, but we cannot select M as it cannot be selected with K. This case satisfies choice A: F or else K.
    
  Case 3: One botanist, two chemists, and one zoologist are selected.
    In this case, we can only select one botanist, and the only botanist left is F. We cannot select K as it cannot be selected with F. Therefore, we must select both L and M as the chemists. We cannot select both P and R as they can only be selected if M is selected, which is already selected in this case. Therefore, we must select Q as the zoologist. This case does not satisfy any of the choices.
    
  Case 4: Two botanists, two chemists, and one zoologist are selected.
    In this case, we must select F as one of the botanists. We cannot select K as it cannot be selected with F. Therefore, we must select either G or H as the other botanist. We must select both L and M as the chemists, but we cannot select M as it cannot be selected with K. We cannot select both P and R as they can only be selected if M is selected, which is not possible in this case. Therefore, we must select either Q or P as the zoologist. This case satisfies choice A: F or else K.
    
  Therefore, the answer is A: F or else K.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or else K.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The panel of five scientists must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.

If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or else K.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Working through the choices:
  A: If G and H are selected, then we cannot select F (because then we would have two botanists and at most one zoologist). We also know that we cannot select K. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  B: If G and H are selected, we know that we cannot select both F and M. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  C: If G and H are selected, we could potentially select both K and M, but we know that K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  D: If G and H are selected, we do not know anything about Q. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  E: If G and H are selected, we know that we cannot select both P and Q. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") (None of the choices are possible given the conditions.)
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, if G and H are selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Analysis:
  If G and H are both selected, then at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist must be selected. 
  If F is not selected, then at least two botanists must be selected, which violates the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. Therefore, F must be selected if G and H are both selected.
  If K is not selected, then M must be selected, which violates the condition that K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, K must be selected if G and H are both selected.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Approach:
  If both G and H are selected, there must be at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist in the panel.
  If there are two botanists, at most one zoologist can be selected.
  The only combination of botanists that satisfies the above condition is F and G.
  If F and G are included, M cannot be included because K and M cannot both be included.
  Therefore, K must be included, and P and R must be included with K because if M is included, P and R must also be included.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we know that the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. We also know that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, if G and H are selected, then at most one botanist can be selected. If we assume that only one botanist is selected, then it must be F, since F is the only botanist who is not excluded by any of the other conditions. If F is selected, then K and M cannot both be selected, so either K or M must be selected. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. Therefore, the panel must include either K or else M. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are three types of scientists: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then there are two botanists in the panel.
  If there are two botanists in the panel, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If M is not selected, then either F or K must be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, either F or K must be selected if M is not selected. 
  
  A: F and K cannot both be selected.
  B: If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. Therefore, F cannot be selected.
  C: If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. Therefore, K cannot be selected.
  D: If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. Therefore, Q cannot be selected.
  E: If there are two botanists in the panel, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, P cannot be selected.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  From the conditions given, we can deduce that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  Since there are only seven sales representatives and we know that some of them work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then it follows that there must be at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3.

  Let's consider each option:
  A: Kim and Mahr are not mentioned in any of the conditions.
  B: Tiao works in Zone 2, so he cannot work in Zone 3 as well.
  C: Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot be split up into different zones. Also, neither Parra nor Quinn is mentioned as working in Zone 3, so this option is not possible.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 2, and either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, so neither Parra nor Udall can work in Zone 3. This option is not possible.
  E: Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. This means that Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in the same zone, which could be Zone 3. Also, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3. Therefore, this option is possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are exactly seven sales representatives - Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones - Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We need to find a list of sales representatives that could be working in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we can eliminate options A and B, which have only 2 sales representatives. Option C has 2 sales representatives and they are both already assigned to Zone 1 or 2, so it cannot be a complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3. Option D has 3 sales representatives, but one of them is assigned to Zone 2, so it cannot be a complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3. Option E has 4 sales representatives and they are all assigned to different zones, so it could be a complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  - From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Therefore, neither Parra nor Udall can work in Zone 2.
  - This means that Parra and Quinn both work in Zone 1 or Zone 3, and Stuckey works in the same zone as Udall.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means that at least three sales representatives work in Zone 3.

Solution: 
  - The only option that includes at least three sales representatives is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs seven sales representatives to work in its three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not include any of the sales representatives who work in Zone 3.
  Option D is incorrect because it only includes three sales representatives, while the question states that there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis: 
  From the given conditions, we can conclude that Tiao and Udall cannot be in the same sales zone since only one of them can be in Zone 2. Also, Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 2 because Tiao or Udall must be in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 1 or Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and we already have one representative in Zone 1 (either Parra or Tiao), it is likely that the remaining representatives are in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The software company has 7 sales representatives and 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that the number of representatives in Zone 3 is greater than the number in Zone 2. 
  Also, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 but not both, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2 but not both. 
  Therefore, Parra and Tiao cannot both be in Zone 3, and Tiao and Udall cannot both be in Zone 3. 
  
Option A: Kim and Mahr are not mentioned as working in the same zone, and neither are mentioned as working in Zone 3. So, this option is not valid.
Option B: Kim is not mentioned as working in Zone 3, and Tiao cannot be in Zone 3 because he already works in Zone 2. So, this option is not valid.
Option C: Parra and Quinn are mentioned as working in the same zone, but neither are mentioned as working in Zone 3. So, this option is not valid.
Option D: Tiao cannot be in Zone 3 because he already works in Zone 2. So, this option is not valid.
Option E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall are not mentioned as working in the same zone, but all of them are mentioned as working in either Zone 1 or Zone 2. Therefore, it is possible that all four of them are in Zone 3, which would satisfy the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This is a valid answer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, but we don't know which sales zone that is.
  - We also know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, the remaining sales representative(s) must work in Zone 3.
  - Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3.

Solution:
  - The only answer choice that has at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3 is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The total number of sales representatives is seven.
  The three sales zones are Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  A: Kim and Mahr are not mentioned to be working in Zone 3.
  B: Kim is not mentioned to be working in Zone 3.
  C: Parra and Quinn are not working in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey and Udall are working in Zone 3, but Tiao is mentioned to be working in Zone 2, which contradicts the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall are not all working in Zone 3, which contradicts the condition that there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We are given a scenario where seven sales representatives work in three different sales zones.
  The conditions given in the question are:
    - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
    - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
    - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
    - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
    - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
    
A: Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3 because there would be no sales representative in Zone 2.
B: Kim cannot work in Zone 3 because there would be no sales representative in Zone 2.
C: Parra and Quinn cannot both work in Zone 3 because we are told that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
D: This could be a possible list because Tiao works in Zone 2, and both Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, they must both work in Zone 3.
E: This cannot be a complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 because we are told that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, but this list includes all the sales representatives.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The question provides information about the sales representatives' names and the sales zones they work in.

  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Elimination:
- Choice A: Kim and Mahr are not mentioned in any of the conditions, so they could work in any of the sales zones. There is no information that supports them working in Zone 3.
- Choice B: Kim and Tiao are mentioned in the conditions, but Tiao works in Zone 2, so Kim cannot work in Zone 3.
- Choice C: Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, but there is no information that supports them working in Zone 3.
- Choice D: Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and Tiao works in Zone 2, so they could all work in Zone 3. This choice is a possibility.
- Choice E: This choice includes all the sales representatives mentioned in the conditions, but there is no information that supports all of them working in Zone 3.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis: 
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of one kind of cookies is made on Wednesday. This means that the third batch of the other kind of cookies is also made on Wednesday. We can use this information and the given conditions to check which statement could be false.
  
  If the first batch of one kind of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday as well. This means that the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday. Here is the schedule of batches:
  
  Monday: oatmeal 1, peanut butter 1, sugar 1
  Tuesday: oatmeal 2, peanut butter 2, sugar 2
  Wednesday: oatmeal 3, peanut butter 3, sugar 1
  Thursday: oatmeal 1, peanut butter 2, sugar 3
  Friday: oatmeal 2, peanut butter 1, sugar 2
  
  Using this schedule, we can evaluate each statement:
  
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - True
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - True
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - False (Three batches are made on Monday)
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - True
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - False (Two batches are made on Friday)
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar— are made in three batches each per week.
  2. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  3. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  4. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  5. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  Let's assume that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday. Then, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday as well. The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday as well. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, the third batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Friday as well. The third batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday.
  If one kind of cookie’s first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie’s third batch, then the only possibility is that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday as well. So, the batches of cookies for each day are:
  Monday: oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar
  Tuesday: sugar, oatmeal, peanut butter
  Wednesday: peanut butter, oatmeal, sugar
  Thursday: sugar, peanut butter, oatmeal
  Friday: oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar
  
Action: Answer("D") - Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

To answer this question, we need to determine which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.

If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the possible combinations are: 
- Oatmeal's first batch = Sugar's third batch
- Peanut butter's first batch = Oatmeal's third batch
- Sugar's first batch = Peanut butter's third batch

Let's evaluate each statement:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - This statement is true as each week there are exactly 9 batches of cookies made, which means that there is at least one batch made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - This statement is true as there are only 3 batches of cookies left to be made on Wednesday, and at least two of them need to be made on that day.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - This statement is false because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, but we also know that there are three batches of each type of cookie made each week.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - This statement is false because we know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, and there are three batches of each type of cookie made each week.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - This statement is true because we know that there are three batches of each type of cookie made each week, and there are already eight batches made from Monday through Thursday.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  Let's label the batches of cookies as follows:
  O1, O2, O3 - Batches of oatmeal cookies
  P1, P2, P3 - Batches of peanut butter cookies
  S1, S2, S3 - Batches of sugar cookies
  
  From the given conditions, we can deduce that:
  - O1 is made on Monday.
  - P1 is made on Monday.
  - S2 is made on Thursday.
  - O2 is made on the same day as P1, which means P1 is not made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - S1 and S3 are not made on Thursday.
  - The remaining batches are made on the remaining days of the week.
  
  We need to check which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  
  Let's consider each statement:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - This is true as there are 9 batches of cookies made in a week.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - This is true as there are at least two batches remaining to be made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - This is false as we know that O1 and P1 are made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - This is true as there are only two batches remaining to be made on Tuesday, which are one batch each of the two remaining cookie types.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - This is true as there is only one batch remaining to be made on Friday, which is the last batch of the remaining cookie type.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
To determine which statement could be false, we need to figure out which statement is affected by the condition that one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.

If we examine the given conditions, we can see that the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the third batch of any other kind of cookies. This is because the third batch of any kind of cookie is made on Friday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, the condition in the question cannot be true.

As a result, the only statement that could be false is:
C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

Action: Answer("C")

    3. Sugar's first batch and Peanut butter's third batch are made on the same day.
  - For each of the above combinations, we need to check which statement could be false.
  - If oatmeal's first batch and sugar's third batch are made on the same day, then:
    - At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days: True (since oatmeal's first batch and sugar's third batch are made on different days, all five days must have at least one batch of cookies).
    - At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday: True (since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the only possibility for Wednesday is oatmeal's second batch and peanut butter's first batch).
    - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday: False (since oatmeal's first batch and sugar's third batch are made on different days, there must be at least two batches of cookies on Monday).
    - Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday: True (since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the only possibility for Tuesday is sugar's first batch and peanut butter's second batch).

    - Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday: True (since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the only possibility for Tuesday is sugar's first batch and peanut butter's second batch).
    - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday: True (since oatmeal's third batch and sugar's second batch are made on different days, there must be exactly one batch of cookies on Friday).
    Therefore, the answer is B.
  - If sugar's first batch and peanut butter's third batch are made on the same day, then:
    - At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days: True (since sugar's first batch and peanut butter's third batch are made on different days, all five days must have at least one batch of cookies).
    - At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday: True (since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the only possibility for Wednesday is oatmeal's second batch and peanut butter's first batch).

  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it means:
  oatmeal 1st batch = peanut butter 1st batch = sugar 3rd batch

Let's examine each statement to see which one could be false:

A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  This statement is true based on the given conditions.

B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  If we look at the given conditions, we can see that the only day where we know for sure that only one batch of cookies is made is Friday. Therefore, it is possible that only one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, making this statement false. 

C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  This statement is false because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, but we don't know if exactly one batch is made.

D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  This statement is true based on the given conditions.

E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  This statement is false because we know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, leaving only one batch of sugar cookies to be made on Friday. Therefore, at least two batches of cookies are made on Friday, making this statement false.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
Choices:
  A: Quinn
  B: Ruiz
  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The project leader must be Quinn or Ruiz.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members.
  
Reasoning:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith must not be a project member. Therefore, we can choose two people from the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue. However, if Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member. We need to choose two people from the remaining four workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, and Xue. Since Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, we can only choose one of them to be a project member. Therefore, we must choose two people from the remaining three workers: Verma, Ruiz (if Quinn is the project leader), and Xue. However, if Ruiz is not the project leader, then he cannot be a project member. Therefore, we must choose two people from the remaining two workers: Verma and Xue. Since we must choose exactly two people, Verma must be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  
If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" is by not selecting Smith as a project member. Therefore, we need to consider two cases:
Case 1: Smith is the project leader
  In this case, we cannot select Quinn or Ruiz as project members. We also cannot select Verma because Wells must be a project member in this case, and Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is selected. Therefore, we must select Wells and two other workers from {Taylor, Smith, Xue}.
  If we select Taylor and Xue, then neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be the project leader or a project member, which contradicts the given constraints. Therefore, we must select Smith and two of {Taylor, Wells, Xue}. Since Taylor cannot be a project member in this case, we must select Wells and Xue.
  Therefore, the project members must be {Smith, Wells, Xue} and the project leader must be Smith.
Case 2: Smith is not the project leader
  In this case, we cannot select Taylor as a project member. Therefore, we must select three workers from {Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, Xue}.
  If we select Quinn or Ruiz, then they must be the project leader, which contradicts the given constraints. Therefore, we cannot select Quinn or Ruiz as project members. 
  If we select Verma, then Wells cannot be a project member, which contradicts the given constraints. Therefore, we cannot select Verma as a project member. 
  Therefore, we must select Wells and two other workers from {Taylor, Smith, Xue}. Since Taylor cannot be a project member in this case, we must select Smith and Xue.
  Therefore, the project members must be {Wells, Smith, Xue} and the project leader must be Smith.
  
In both cases, Smith must be a project member. Therefore, 
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  To be a project member, Quinn or Ruiz must lead the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Exactly one of the project members will be the project leader.
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member since Smith and Taylor are mutually dependent. 
  Therefore, only two workers are left to be project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member, which means that Quinn must be a project member and also be the project leader. 
  If Wells is not a project member, then exactly three workers are left to be considered as project members: Quinn, Ruiz, and Verma. In this case, Quinn or Ruiz must lead the project, and Verma cannot be a project member. Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The project consists of three workers, and only one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith will not be a project member either. Therefore, the only way for Wells to be a project member is if he is the project leader, because if he is not the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. If Wells is the project leader, then Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member, because Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, the answer is either Quinn or Ruiz.

Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members, and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member, since if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, the project members must be three of the remaining five workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  If Quinn or Ruiz are selected, then one of them must be the project leader. Therefore, the third member of the project cannot be Verma or Ruiz, since Wells is incompatible with Verma and Quinn or Ruiz must lead if they are selected.
  Therefore, the third member of the project must be either Wells or Xue.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Three workers will be selected to be project members, and one of these project members will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Reasoning:
  - If Taylor is not a project member, but Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member. This is a contradiction, so Smith cannot be a project member.
  - Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member.
  - If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. This means that the project leader must be either Quinn or Xue.
  - Since Taylor is not a project member, and Smith is not a project member, the remaining workers who can be project members are Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  - From the above, we know that if Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Wells must be a project member.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We need to find out which worker must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If Taylor is not a project member, and Smith is a project member, then Taylor must be a project member. But this contradicts the given information. Therefore, Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Also, if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member. 
  This means that the project members must be selected from the four remaining workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, and Xue.
  Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, one of them must be the project leader. 
  Therefore, the project members are either Quinn and Xue or Ruiz and Xue, with Quinn or Ruiz being the project leader. 
  In either case, Quinn must be a project member. Therefore, Answer("A") is the correct choice.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The project leader must be one of Quinn or Ruiz.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members.
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: 
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member. 
  If Wells is not a project member, then either Ruiz or Verma must be a project member, but this is impossible because if Ruiz is a project member, then he must be the leader, but if he is the leader, then Verma cannot be a project member; similarly, if Verma is a project member, then Wells cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, Wells must be a project member. 
  Also, since exactly three workers are project members, Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member. 
  But Ruiz cannot be a project member unless he is the leader, so Quinn must be a project member. 
  Therefore, the three project members are Quinn, Wells, and one of Smith, Taylor, or Xue. 
  Since Taylor is not a project member, either Smith or Xue must be a project member. 
  But if Xue is a project member, then there is no project leader, so Smith must be a project member. 
  Therefore, Quinn, Wells, and Smith are the project members, and Smith is the leader. 
  The answer is A: Quinn.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have three members.
  One of the members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member. Therefore, the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" does not apply. However, we still need to consider the constraint "If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be." This means that if Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Since we know that exactly three workers will be selected, then we can conclude that Wells must be a project member in order to satisfy this constraint. This means that the project will have two remaining members to select from the remaining workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue. However, we know that Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Since there can only be one project leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. This means that the other worker cannot be a project member. Therefore, the only worker left to select from is Xue, which is our answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Exactly three of the seven workers will be selected to be project members.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member.
  The project leader must be a project member.
  The project leader cannot be Verma or Wells.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member. 
  The project leader must be a project member, but the project leader cannot be Verma or Wells. 
  Therefore, the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz. 
  If Ruiz is the project leader, then Quinn must also be a project member. 
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Quinn must be a project member.

Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Veqemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon
  C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy
  D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than, wellspring
  E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Six bands are filling six slots numbered slot one through slot six.
  The order must meet the following constraints:
    1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
    
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then it must perform before Zircon. Hence, Zircon must perform in one of the last three slots. Therefore, Uneasy must perform in one of the first three slots.
  
  A: We don't know if Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: We don't know if Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  C: We don't know if Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
  D: We don't know if Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
  E: We know that Zircon performs in one of the last three slots, but we don't know if it performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The six slots at a benefit concert are numbered slot one through slot six.
  The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or slot two.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or slot two. Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots four, five, or six. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and both cannot perform in slot four, then Xpert must perform in slot six. This means Uneasy must perform in slot four or five. Therefore, it is possible for Wellspring to perform in an earlier slot than Yardsign. So, the only choice that must be true is D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered from one to six and six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Vegemite performs in slot three, Yardsign cannot perform in slot three.
  - According to the constraints, Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, and Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  - From the constraints, we know that Wellspring and Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. However, we don't know which one performs first.
  - We also know that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, but we don't know which slot Zircon is in.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, if Vegemite performs in slot three, Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered slot one through slot six.
  - The bands are Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in either slot one or two.
  
Analysis:
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in either slot one or two.
  - If Yardsign performs in slot one or two, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slot one or two as well, which means Xpert must perform in slot six. 
  - If Xpert performs in slot six, then Uneasy must perform in either slot four or five. 
  - If Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots and Xpert performs in slot six, then Uneasy must perform in slot four. 
  - If Uneasy performs in slot four, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slot one or two. 
  - If Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two, respectively. 
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three and Yardsign performs in slot one, then Zircon must perform in slot two and Uneasy must perform in slot four. 
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot six.
  Uneasy will perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Yardsign will perform in slot one, two, or three.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  There are no other constraints on the order of the bands.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or two. Since Uneasy has to perform in one of the last three slots, it must perform in slot four or five. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Since Zircon is in slot six, Wellspring must be in slot four or five, while Xpert must be in slot six. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we can deduce that:
  - Zircon cannot perform in slot one or two because Vegemite performs in slot three and should perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Xpert cannot perform in slot six because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy cannot perform in slot one, two, or three because Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots and Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Zircon cannot perform in slot one or two, then Wellspring must perform in one of those slots, which means Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Vegemite is in slot 3.
  
Analysis:
  From the information given, we can infer that Zircon will perform in slot 6 because Vegemite is in slot 3 and Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Also, Wellspring will perform in slot 5 because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy will perform in slot 4 because Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Therefore, Yardsign will perform in slot 1 because Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Finally, the only slot remaining is slot 2, which must be filled by Zircon.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  According to the constraints, we know that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Since Vegemite performs in slot three, Zircon must perform in slot four, five or six. Also, Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. If Zircon performs in slot four, five or six, then Xpert must perform in slot six. This leaves slots four and five for Wellspring and Uneasy. Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, it must perform in slot six. This leaves slot four for Wellspring. Finally, Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot one.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The slots are numbered from one to six, and each band will perform in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Process of elimination: 
  - Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and Vegemite already performs in slot three, Uneasy cannot perform in slot four, so it must perform in slot five or six.
  - Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, and Vegemite already performs in slot three, Yardsign cannot perform in slot one, so it must perform in slot two or three.
  - Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Vegemite already performs in slot three, Xpert cannot perform in slot four or five, so it must perform in slot six.
  - Since Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Vegemite already performs in slot three, Zircon must perform in slot four or later.
  
Analysis: 
  - Uneasy performs in slot five or six.
  - Yardsign performs in slot two or three.
  - Xpert performs in slot six.
  - Zircon performs in slot four or later.
  - Wellspring must perform in slot one.
  - Uneasy performs in slot six if Yardsign performs in slot two, or Uneasy performs in slot five if Yardsign performs in slot three.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
  A: We cannot say for sure if Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: We cannot say for sure if Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  C: We cannot say for sure if Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is not: Peters, Rovero, Tao, Villas, White.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is not: Quinn, Tao, Stanton, Villas, White.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of recruitment is not: Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Villas, White.
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the possible order of recruitment is: Peters, Quinn, Stanton, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao or Peters, Quinn, Stanton, Villas, White, Tao, Rovero.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment from earliest to latest is Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, Tao.
  A: Quinn cannot be recruited first because Peters was recruited fourth.
  B: Rovero cannot be recruited third because Peters was recruited fourth and Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  C: Stanton cannot be recruited second because Peters was recruited fourth.
  D: Tao cannot be recruited sixth because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  E: Villas can be recruited sixth because the order of recruitment from earliest to latest is Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, Tao.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must have been recruited last. Since Peters was recruited fourth, then the order of recruitment must be one of the following:
  1- Quinn, Villas, Rovero, Peters, White, Stanton, Tao
  2- Quinn, Villas, Rovero, Peters, White, Tao, Stanton
  3- Quinn, Villas, Rovero, Peters, Tao, White, Stanton
  4- Villas, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, White, Stanton, Tao
  5- Villas, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Tao, White, Stanton
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The only option that fits the given conditions is that Rovero was recruited third.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth. 
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. 
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. 
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we know that Peters was recruited fourth and Villas was recruited immediately before White. So, the order of these four accomplices is Peters, X, Villas, White.
  Also, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. So, the order of these three accomplices is Quinn, Rovero, X. 
  Now, we are given that White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao. So, the possible order of these three accomplices is White, Rovero, Tao. 

Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, Tao could have been recruited sixth.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The criminal recruited accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then we know that Tao was recruited last. This means that Stanton was recruited before Tao, and Quinn was recruited before Rovero. Peters was recruited fourth, which means that the order of recruitment of the first three accomplices was Quinn, Villas, and Stanton (in some order). This leaves Peters, Rovero, Tao, and White to be recruited in some order as the last four accomplices. 

A: Quinn was recruited first. This is not possible, since Quinn was recruited before Rovero and Peters, who were recruited third and fourth, respectively.
B: Rovero was recruited third. This is possible, since Peters was recruited fourth, and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, who was recruited last.
C: Stanton was recruited second. This is not possible, since Quinn, Villas, and Stanton (in some order) were recruited as the first three accomplices.
D: Tao was recruited sixth. This is not possible, since Tao was recruited last.
E: Villas was recruited sixth. This is not possible, since Peters was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited immediately before White.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven people that the criminal recruited.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so there are three people recruited before Peters.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  The order of recruitment is consecutive and only one person is recruited at a time.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then White was recruited before Tao.
  If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then Villas was not recruited seventh.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we know that White was recruited before Rovero and Rovero was recruited before Tao. Therefore, White was recruited before Tao. This means that Tao was recruited either sixth or seventh. Peters was recruited fourth, so there are three people recruited before Peters. Therefore, Quinn was either recruited first or second. Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas was not recruited seventh. This means that Villas was either recruited fifth or sixth.

Action: Answer("D")  
The only option that can be true is that Tao was recruited sixth.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao and White was recruited earlier than Rovero, then Tao must have been recruited either fifth or sixth. 
  
  If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then Villas must have been recruited either first, second, or third. 
  
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited either first or second.
  
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters must have been recruited before Tao.
  
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Rovero was recruited third.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of the three must be: White, Rovero, and Tao.
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the four must be: Quinn, Villas, Peters, and one of (White, Rovero, Tao).
  - Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, then the order of the five must be: Quinn, Villas, Peters, White, and Rovero or Tao.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, then the order of the six must be: Quinn, Villas, Peters, White, Rovero, and Stanton or Tao.
  - If Tao was recruited sixth, then Stanton must be recruited second, which is not possible.
  - Therefore, Tao must be recruited sixth, and Stanton must be recruited fifth.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  2. Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Peters was recruited fourth.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  6. White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  7. Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.

We know that Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, __, __, Peters, __, __, __. We also know that Villas was recruited immediately before White and White was recruited earlier than Rovero. This means that the order of recruitment must be Peters, __, __, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Stanton, and Quinn. This order satisfies all the conditions given in the question.

Option A cannot be true because Peters was recruited fourth. Option B cannot be true because Rovero was recruited after Villas and White. Option C cannot be true because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Option D cannot be true because Tao was recruited last. Option E cannot be true because Villas was recruited before White.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  2. Peters was recruited fourth.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  6. White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  7. Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.

To determine the possible order of the seven accomplices, we can start by placing Peters in the fourth position. Then, we can use the given clues to create a list of possible orders. For example:

1. Quinn, Villas, White, Peters, Rovero, Stanton, Tao
2. Quinn, Villas, White, Peters, Rovero, Tao, Stanton
3. Quinn, Villas, White, Peters, Stanton, Rovero, Tao
4. Quinn, Villas, White, Stanton, Peters, Rovero, Tao

Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Analysis: According to the given information, Villas was recruited immediately before White, so we know that Villas was recruited earlier than Rovero. This means that Tao was also recruited after Villas, and therefore cannot be sixth. We also know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so we can eliminate A and B. The only remaining option is C, which is possible based on the given information.

  - The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - A: F and M cannot be on the bottom shelf because there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - B: H cannot be on the bottom shelf because there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - C: G, H, and K cannot be on the bottom shelf because K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - D: This is a possible list of books on the bottom shelf. F and O can be on the top shelf, and G, H, I, K, and L can be on the middle shelf.
  - E: G, H, and L cannot be on the bottom shelf because O is placed on a higher shelf than L. M cannot be on the bottom shelf because F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So, the top shelf has at most two books.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  A: F and M cannot be placed on the bottom shelf because F and M are on the same shelf.
  B: F and M are on the same shelf, so they cannot be placed on different shelves. H is not mentioned to be placed on any specific shelf, so it could be placed on the bottom shelf. Thus, the answer choice could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf.
  C: G, H, and K cannot be placed on the bottom shelf because K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is not mentioned to be placed on the top shelf.
  D: F, G, M, and O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf because O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and L is not mentioned to be placed on the top shelf.
  E: G, H, L, and M cannot be placed on the bottom shelf because F and M are placed on the same shelf.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:

- At least two books are placed on each shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
- We know that there are at least two books on the bottom shelf, and the total number of books is eight.
- We know that F and M are on the same shelf, and we need to find out which of them could be on the bottom shelf.
- We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
- We know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
- We know that I is on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
- We know that each shelf has at least two books, so G and L cannot be on the bottom shelf.
- We are left with H and M as possible books on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf
  - I is placed on the middle shelf
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M
  
Analysis:
  - From the given conditions, we know that F and M are placed on the same shelf, and I is placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, F, M, and I cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  - From the given conditions, we know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, K cannot be placed on the bottom shelf while F is on a higher shelf.
  - From the given conditions, we know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, if O is placed on the bottom shelf, then L must also be on the bottom shelf. 
  - The remaining books are G and H. If we place G and H on the middle shelf, then we would have 2 books on the top shelf and 4 books on the bottom shelf, which satisfies the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: F, M are on the same shelf, so this cannot be the bottom shelf.
  B: F, H, M are on the same shelf, so this cannot be the bottom shelf.
  C: G, H, K are not on the same shelf as I, which is on the middle shelf.
  D: This could be possible.
  E: G, H, L, M are not on the same shelf as I, which is on the middle shelf.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: This option has only two books, which is less than the minimum of two books on each shelf.
  B: H is on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  C: This option does not include any of the books that are required to be placed on the bottom shelf.
  D: This option includes all the books that are required to be placed on the bottom shelf and satisfies all the given conditions.
  E: This option includes L, which violates the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is on the middle shelf.
  K is on a higher shelf than F.
  O is on a higher shelf than L.
  F is on the same shelf as M.
  There are three shelves in total, and at least two books are on each shelf.
  
Elimination:
  Since F and M are on the same shelf, they cannot both be on the bottom shelf.
  Since I is on the middle shelf, none of the books on the middle shelf can be on the bottom shelf.
  Since K is on a higher shelf than F, neither K nor F can be on the bottom shelf.
  Since O is on a higher shelf than L, neither O nor L can be on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("D") 
  Therefore, the only remaining option is D: F, G, M, O.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - From the first condition, we know that there are more books on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - From the last condition, we know that F and M are on the same shelf.
  - From the second condition, we know that I is not on the bottom shelf.
  - From the third condition, we know that K is not on the bottom shelf.
  - From the fourth condition, we know that O is not on the bottom shelf.
  - From the first condition again, we know that there are at least two books on each shelf. Therefore, there must be at least two books on the bottom shelf.

Solution:
  - Since F and M are on the same shelf, and there are at least two books on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that both F and M are on the bottom shelf.
  - We can eliminate choices C, D, and E because they do not include F and M on the bottom shelf.
  - Choice A only includes F and M on the bottom shelf, but it does not include any other books, which violates the condition that there are at least two books on each shelf.
  - Choice B includes F and M on the bottom shelf, and it also includes another book (H) on the bottom shelf, which satisfies all the conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
- There are 3 shelves: top shelf, middle shelf, and bottom shelf.
- Each shelf has at least 2 books.
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.
 
Analysis:
- From the given conditions, we know that I is on the middle shelf, so it can't be on the top or bottom shelf.
- We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K can't be on the bottom shelf.
- Similarly, O is on a higher shelf than L, so O can't be on the bottom shelf.
- Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and each shelf has at least 2 books, the possible configurations for the shelves are:
  3-3-2 or 4-2-2.
- If F and M are on the same shelf, and K, I, and O are not on the bottom shelf, then the only possible configuration is 4-2-2, which means F and M are on the bottom shelf.
- Therefore, the answer is (A) F, M.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - Since I is placed on the middle shelf, we know that I is not on the top or bottom shelf.
  - Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, we know that K is not on the bottom shelf.
  - Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, we know that O is not on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, we know that F and M are on the same shelf.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - Since there are at least 2 books on each shelf, there must be at least 2 books on the bottom shelf, and at least 2 books on the top shelf. 
  - Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be more than 2 books on the bottom shelf. 
  - Based on the given conditions, we know that I, K, and O cannot be on the bottom shelf. 
  - Therefore, the only books that could be placed on the bottom shelf are F, G, H, L, and M. 
  - However, since F and M are on the same shelf, we can eliminate H and L from the list. 
  - Therefore, the only possible list of books placed on the bottom shelf is F and M. 
  - Thus, the answer is B.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are four walls in the exhibition room numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  - Each wall displays exactly two paintings - one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - Four students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs - each display exactly two paintings - an oil and a watercolor.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we can deduce the following:
  - Isaacs's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 4, but not on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  - Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3 (the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed), which means that his oil must be displayed on wall 1 or 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 2 and wall 4 (in some order), but we don't know which is displayed on which wall.
  
  Therefore, the painting that must be displayed on wall 1 is Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Each wall has exactly 2 paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, the only possible painting that can be displayed on wall 1 is Hidalgo's oil. This is because:
  - Wall 4 already has Isaacs's oil, so it cannot have Hidalgo's oil.
  - Wall 3 has Franz's oil, so it cannot have Hidalgo's oil.
  - Wall 2 has Isaacs's watercolor, so it cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor.
  - Wall 1 cannot have Greene's oil or watercolor, as it would violate condition 5.
  - Wall 1 cannot have Franz's watercolor, as it would violate condition 4.
  - Therefore, the only possible painting that can be displayed on wall 1 is Hidalgo's oil.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each of the four walls has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, in the upper and lower positions.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
- If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1. 

Explanation: 
- By condition 4, we know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, neither of them can be on wall 2 or wall 3.
- By condition 5, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Franz's oil is on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be on wall 3 as well.
- By condition 3, we know that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, if Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 2, then the other painting on wall 2 must be by a different student. This means that neither of Isaacs's paintings can be on wall 1 or wall 4.
- By condition 2, we know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, the other painting on wall 2 must be an oil painting. Since Hidalgo's oil is the only one left, it must be on wall 2.
- By condition 6, we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, the other painting on wall 4 must be an oil painting, and it cannot be by Franz or Isaacs. The only oil painting left is Hidalgo's oil, so it must be on wall 4.
- This leaves wall 1 with only two possible paintings: Greene's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor. By condition 3, we know that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, if Greene's oil is on wall 1, then the other painting on wall 1 must be by a different student. This means that Hidalgo's watercolor must be on wall 1.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student has exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  Each wall has exactly two paintings: an upper painting and a lower painting.
  No wall has only watercolors.
  No wall has the work of only one student.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.

Action: Answer("D") 
If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be on wall 1, because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Also, since no wall can have only watercolors and no wall can have the work of only one student, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on walls 2 and 4 in some order. Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 4, leaving Hidalgo's oil to be displayed on wall 1. Thus, the answer is Hidalgo's oil.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student will display exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each wall.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  Since Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed (based on the condition: Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed). Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 4. However, since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, it cannot be displayed on wall 4. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1. Thus, the answer is C: Greene's watercolor.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each of the 4 walls displays 2 paintings.
  2. Each wall has one painting in the upper position and one painting in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: 
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 4 (since Isaacs has one oil and one watercolor painting). Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 3, but not both. Since Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, it follows that Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 3. Therefore, Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 3, but it can be displayed on wall 1. Additionally, since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, it follows that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 2, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  - Each displays exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  - Two paintings on each of the four walls, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors.
  - No wall has only one student's work.
  - No wall has paintings by both Franz and Isaacs.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  - Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  Since Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, it means that Isaacs's oil cannot be on wall 2. Since Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, it means that Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 3. Therefore, Franz's watercolor must be on wall 1, and since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, it means that Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 2. Thus, the only painting left is Hidalgo's watercolor, which must be displayed on wall 4, and Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1. Therefore, the answer is C, which is Greene's watercolor.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  - Each student displays exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3:
  - Isaacs's oil cannot be on wall 1 since no wall can have both Isaacs and Franz's paintings.
  - Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 1 since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  - Hidalgo's oil cannot be on wall 1 since no wall can have only one student's paintings displayed on it.
  This leaves us with only one option:
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on walls 1 and 4. Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1, and his watercolor must be displayed on wall 3. Therefore, the answer is B: Greene's oil.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - George gives a report on Tuesday.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
  
  A: There must be at least one report given on Wednesday morning and one report given on Wednesday afternoon, but Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so this cannot be true.
  B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. However, George cannot give his report on Wednesday, so this cannot be true.
  C: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, but George cannot give his report on Monday, so this cannot be true.
  D: If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Robert and George must give reports on Tuesday. But, neither Robert nor Olivia can give an afternoon report, so this cannot be true.
  E: Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so if he gives a report, he must give it in the morning. Then, George must give his report in the afternoon on Tuesday, Nina must give her report in the morning on Wednesday, and Helen and Irving must give their reports in the afternoon on Wednesday. This scenario satisfies all the given conditions and is possible.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Solution:
  - If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then one of the reports must be given on Monday and the other two reports must be given on Wednesday.
  - Since Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports, they can only give reports in the morning on Monday and Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports, but there are no students left who can give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina can only give a report on Wednesday.
  - If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Robert must give a report on Wednesday, but there are no students left who can give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Olivia cannot give a report on Monday.
  - Therefore, the only possible option is that Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 students who will give oral reports.
  - Exactly 6 students will give oral reports over 3 days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
  - Exactly 2 reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  We know that George, Nina, and Robert will give reports and they will do so on different days from one another. This means that George must give his report on Tuesday, and since exactly two reports will be given on Tuesday, Nina and Robert must give their reports on Monday and Wednesday, but we don't know which one will be on which day. 

  A: Helen must give a report on Tuesday (along with George), so this is not a valid option.
  B: Nina must give a report on Monday for this option to be true, but we know that George will give his report on Tuesday, so this is not a valid option.
  C: This could be true. If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. George will give his report on Tuesday, and Robert will give his report on Monday.
  D: Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so this is not a valid option.
  E: Robert must give his report on Wednesday, so this is not a valid option.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
George can only give a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, George, Nina, and Robert must all give reports in the morning. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday, or else Helen and Irving would both have to give reports on Tuesday, which would violate the rule that George can only give a report on Tuesday. Thus, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. Since Robert cannot give an afternoon report, he must give his report on Monday morning. Therefore, George must give his report on Tuesday afternoon and Helen and Irving must give their reports on Monday afternoon.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  2. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  3. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another:
  1. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George is giving a report on Tuesday.
  2. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible since Robert is giving a report on Wednesday and he cannot give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the next day.

Analysis:
  1. Helen gives a report on Wednesday: This is possible because neither George, Nina, nor Robert is giving a report on Wednesday.
  2. Nina gives a report on Monday: This is not possible because if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible.
  3. Nina gives a report on Tuesday: This is not possible because if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible since Robert is giving a report on Wednesday and he cannot give an afternoon report.
  4. Olivia gives a report on Monday: This is not possible because Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
  5. Robert gives a report on Wednesday: This is possible because neither George, Nina, nor Robert is giving a report on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly six students will give reports over three consecutive days, with two reports given each day.
  George can only give his report on Tuesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
  
Solution:
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, then Helen, Irving, and Kyle must also give reports. 
  Since George can only give his report on Tuesday, and Nina is giving a report, then Nina's report cannot be on Tuesday, so it must be on Monday or Wednesday. 
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But Kyle cannot give a report, so Olivia and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. This would mean that Robert's report must be in the afternoon, which is not allowed. So, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Thursday. This means that Kyle must give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Lenore must give reports on Monday. This means that Robert must give a report on Wednesday, which is allowed. 
  Therefore, it is possible that Nina gives a report on Wednesday and Robert gives a report on Wednesday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly three workers will be selected for the project and one of them will be the project leader.
  - Quinn and Ruiz can be project members only if they lead the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis: 
  - If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, there are four workers remaining (Ruiz, Taylor, Verma, and Xue) and only two spots left, so it is not completely determined.
  - If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, there are four workers remaining (Ruiz, Smith, Verma, and Xue) but it is not clear who will be the project leader, so it is not completely determined.
  - If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, there are four workers remaining (Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, and Verma) and only two spots left, so it is not completely determined.
  - If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, there are four workers remaining (Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue) and only two spots left, so it is not completely determined.
  - If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected, and Smith and Taylor must also be selected. This leaves only Quinn and Xue as the remaining workers, and Quinn must be the project leader. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three workers will be selected for the project and one of them will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can only be selected if they are the project leader.
  - If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be selected.
  - If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells can be selected. This is because Wells cannot be selected if either Ruiz or Verma is selected. Since exactly three workers will be selected, and Wells can only be selected if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, this means that the other two workers selected must be from the group {Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue} - {Wells, Ruiz, Verma}. 

If we look at the remaining workers, we see that Quinn or Ruiz can only be selected if they are the project leader. Since exactly one of the three selected workers will be the leader, this means that either Quinn or Ruiz must be selected. Therefore, the only possibility is to select Quinn or Ruiz as the leader, and then select Smith and one of Taylor or Xue as the other two members. This selection satisfies all the constraints, so the selection is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
  We can use the elimination method to solve this question. 

Elimination:
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor must not be selected. Thus, we cannot determine the selection of the three workers.
  B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected. Thus, we cannot determine the selection of the three workers.
  C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then Ruiz must be the project leader, and Wells cannot be a project member. Thus, we cannot determine the selection of the three workers.
  D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then at most one of Quinn and Smith can be selected. If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected. Thus, the project leader must be one of Quinn or Smith, and the third member must be Xue. We can determine the selection of the three workers in this case.
  E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then if Wells is selected, the project leader must be Quinn. The third member cannot be Ruiz or Verma. Thus, the third member must be one of Smith, Taylor, or Xue. If Wells is not selected, the project leader must be Ruiz. The third member cannot be Verma. Thus, the third member must be one of Smith, Taylor, Wells, or Xue. In both cases, we can determine the selection of the three workers.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three workers will be selected for the special project and one of them will be the project leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then that person must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, it means that the project leader must be Ruiz. But, if Ruiz is selected, then Verma cannot be selected since Wells is also selected. This means that the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then it means that the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz. But, if Ruiz is selected, then Verma cannot be selected since Wells is also selected. This means that the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then it means that the project leader must be Ruiz. But, if Ruiz is selected, then Verma cannot be selected since Wells is also selected. This means that the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then it means that the project leader can be either Quinn or Smith. If Quinn is the leader, then Ruiz can also be selected, but if Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected. This means that the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then it means that the project leader can be either Quinn or Ruiz. If Quinn is the leader, then either Smith or Taylor can be selected. If Ruiz is the leader, then neither Verma nor Ruiz can be selected. This means that the selection is completely determined and the project members are: Quinn (leader), Smith, and Taylor.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three members, and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith being selected does not provide enough information to determine the selection of the project members.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor being selected does not provide enough information to determine the selection of the project members.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue being selected does not provide enough information to determine the selection of the project members.
  D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells are selected, then the only possible project leader will be Smith. If Smith is the project leader, then Taylor must also be a member. Therefore, the third member can only be Verma, making the selection completely determined.
  E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma are selected, then the only possible project leader will be Quinn. Therefore, Quinn will be a member and the third member can only be Xue. However, this does not satisfy the constraint that Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have 3 members and 1 leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be members if they are leaders.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be a member.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members.

Analysis:
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, there are still several possible combinations of members and leader that satisfy the constraints.
  B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, there are still several possible combinations of members and leader that satisfy the constraints.
  C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, there are still several possible combinations of members and leader that satisfy the constraints.
  D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Quinn must be the leader and Smith and Taylor must be the other members. This satisfies all the constraints.
  E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Quinn must be the leader and Smith and Taylor must be the other members. This satisfies all the constraints.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the only possible project leader is Quinn. This means that Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member. We know that neither Ruiz nor Wells can be selected, so the only possible third member is one of Smith, Taylor, Verma, or Xue. However, if Verma is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be a project member, which violates the constraints. Therefore, Verma cannot be selected. Similarly, if Xue is selected, then Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member, which also violates the constraints. Therefore, Xue cannot be selected. This leaves only Smith and Taylor as possible third members, and we know that Taylor must be selected if Smith is. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly 3 members, and one of them will be the leader.
  Constraints:
  - Quinn or Ruiz can only be selected if leading the project.
  - If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be selected.
  - If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  
A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, it is still possible that Taylor could be selected along with two other people, and one of them could be the project leader. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, it is still possible that Smith could be selected along with two other people, and one of them could be the project leader. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, there are still 5 people left to choose from. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then either Quinn or Xue must be the project leader, and the other one of them must be selected along with Taylor. Therefore, the selection is completely determined.
E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then either Quinn or Xue must be the project leader, and the other one of them must be selected along with Taylor. Therefore, the selection is completely determined.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The project will have 3 members and only one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn and Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Action: Answer("D") 
If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Quinn can be selected and lead the project. Smith and Taylor can be the other two members. Verma and Xue are left out. This satisfies all the constraints and so the selection is completely determined.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The project consists of three positions: a project leader and two project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are exactly seven sales representatives and three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also be in that same sales zone, because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Since there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Mahr must work in Zone 1, and Parra and Tiao must work in Zone 3. 
  Therefore, the only choice that could be true is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 (but not both).
  2. Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2 (but not both).
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  5. There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Stuckey and Udall must also work in the same sales zone. 
  
  A: We don't know where Kim works, so we cannot confirm if this statement is true.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 1 because Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  C: We don't know if Parra works in Zone 3 or not, so we cannot confirm if this statement is true.
  D: This statement could be true because Stuckey could work in Zone 2 if Mahr also works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone:
  Mahr and Stuckey cannot be in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Mahr and Stuckey cannot be in Zone 2 because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2 and Stuckey cannot be in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey must be in Zone 3.
  Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, at least 3 sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 3 because they work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  If Parra is in Zone 1, Tiao cannot be in Zone 1, so Tiao must be in Zone 2 and Udall cannot be in Zone 2, so Udall must be in Zone 3.
  This means there are 4 representatives in Zone 3 and 2 representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts "There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2."
  Therefore, Parra must be in Zone 2 and Tiao must be in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 1, Udall cannot be in Zone 1, so Udall must be in Zone 3.
  This means there are 4 representatives in Zone 3 and 2 representatives in Zone 2, which satisfies "There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2."
  
Action: Answer("D") - Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot be in that sales zone because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, Udall cannot be in that sales zone.
  - Therefore, Udall must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  - If Udall is in Zone 1, then Parra cannot be in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  - Therefore, Parra must be in Zone 3.
  - Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  - Therefore, Quinn and Parra must be in Zone 3, which means Tiao must be in Zone 2.
  - Kim cannot be in Zone 2 because there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, and Tiao and Udall are already assigned to Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("B") - Mahr works in Zone 1.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives who work in 3 different sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they cannot work in Zone 2, according to the given information. 
  A: There is no information about Kim's sales zone.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 1, because only one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and it is known that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  C: There is no information about Parra's sales zone.
  D: Stuckey could work in Zone 2, but it is not the only possibility.
  E: Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, because only one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and it is known that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The company employs seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, which means that they cannot be in different zones. 
From the rule that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and since Tiao is already assigned to a zone, we know that Parra works in Zone 1. 
Also, from the rule that either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, and since Tiao is already assigned to a zone, we know that Udall works in Zone 2.
Since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn should also work in Zone 1.
Now we know that only Mahr, Kim, and Stuckey can be in Zone 3. But since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then three sales representatives cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Kim must work in Zone 1.

A: Kim works in Zone 2. - False, Kim works in Zone 1.
B: Mahr works in Zone 1. - True, Mahr can work in Zone 1 with Quinn and Parra.
C: Parra works in Zone 3. - False, Parra works in Zone 1.
D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. - False, Stuckey works in Zone 1 or Zone 3 with Mahr.
E: Tiao works in Zone 1. - False, Tiao works in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey. Therefore, there are at least three sales representatives in the same sales zone. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall all work in Zone 3. This means that Kim, Parra, Quinn, and Tiao must all work in Zone 1 or Zone 2. However, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, so it follows that Kim, Quinn, and Tiao must all work in Zone 2. Therefore, the only statement that could be true is:
  Answer("D") Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
- More representatives are in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then neither of them can be in Zone 3 because there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 2.

A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
B: Mahr can work in Zone 1 as long as Parra is not there.
C: Parra can work in Zone 3 as long as Tiao is in Zone 1 and Udall is in Zone 2.
D: Stuckey cannot work in Zone 2 because Mahr and Stuckey are in the same sales zone.
E: Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 if Parra is already there.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must work in that same zone since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 1 since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Parra cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn. That leaves Kim and Parra to work in Zone 3. Therefore, the answer is C: Parra works in Zone 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The novel consists of seven chapters, and each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. 
  Because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so W must be mentioned in either chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  Because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  Because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and W is in either chapter 4 or 6, S and Z must be mentioned in either chapter 3 and 5 or chapter 5 and 7.
  Because R has not been mentioned yet, it must be mentioned in either chapter 3 or chapter 7.

Action: Answer("D") 
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. 
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, or 4.
  Because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and T is in chapter 2, S and Z must be mentioned in either chapter 4 and 6 or chapter 5 and 7.
  Because R has not been mentioned yet, it must be mentioned in either chapter 3 or chapter 7. 
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5. 
  Answer choices A, B, C, and E are all impossible given these constraints.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  The novel has seven chapters: chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Since X is mentioned in chapter 1, the following must be true:
  1. T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, T must be mentioned in either chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  2. U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, X and U must be mentioned in chapters 1 and 2, respectively.
  3. W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, W must be mentioned in either chapter 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  4. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 5, 5 and 6, or 6 and 7.
  5. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, and must be mentioned in either chapter 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  
Now, we evaluate each choice:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. This is possible, as R can be mentioned in any of the remaining chapters (3, 4, 5, 6, or 7).
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. This is possible, as R can be mentioned in any of the remaining chapters (2, 3, 4, 5, or 6), except for chapter 1.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. This is not possible, as S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. This is possible, as W can be mentioned in any of the remaining chapters (4, 6, or 7), and X is already mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. This is not possible, as S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Therefore, the answer is A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The order of the clues is subject to the following constraints:
    - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
    - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
    - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - X is mentioned in chapter 1.
  
Action: 
If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 and must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6. Since T must be mentioned before W, T must be mentioned in chapter 3. Then, R must be mentioned in chapter 7, and S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 5 (in either order). 
Thus, the only choice that could be true is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. 
Answer: D
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z) that must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then X cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  If S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, then S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 6 and 7 in some order.
  
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, choice C is not possible.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then X cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, choice A is not possible.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5. Therefore, choices B, C, and E are not possible.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3. Therefore, choice D is possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  We need to find the possible order of the clues if X is mentioned in chapter 1.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Elimination:
  A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6, which violates the constraint that T must be mentioned before W.
  B: If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4, and W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  C: If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, and T must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  D: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and either S or Z must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  E: If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, and T must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once in one of the seven chapters.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.

  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2 according to the last constraint. 
  - Then, according to the constraint that W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  - According to the constraint that T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 7.
  - According to the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 3 and 4 in some order, or in chapters 5 and 6 in some order.
  - Therefore, R can be mentioned in chapter 7, as it is the only remaining chapter.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1. 
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
  - U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. So, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  - S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  - Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
  - R cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 7 because T and W must be mentioned in those chapters respectively. So, R must be mentioned in chapter 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Therefore, the only choice that could be true is:
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.

  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Since X is mentioned in chapter 1, U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3. Since T must be mentioned before W, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5. Since there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, W must be mentioned in chapter 6. Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, X cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 4. Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 7. R can be mentioned in chapter 3 or 7.

Action: Answer("B")

  Since W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, W must be mentioned in either chapter 4 or 6.
  Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or 3.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, which means S must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, which means S must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Since S cannot be mentioned in an adjacent chapter to Z, then Z must be mentioned in either chapter 4 or 6.
  Since R has not yet been placed, it could be in any of the remaining chapters: 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Since W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, W must be mentioned in either chapter 4 or 6.
  Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or 3.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, which means S must be mentioned in chapter 7.

Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E") 

If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the photographs in the Sports section must be taken by Fuentes and Hue. According to the given conditions, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. So, if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, the only possibility is that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Thus, it is possible for both photographs in the Sports section to be by Hue. Therefore, the answer is (E).
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each section needs exactly 2 photos, and there are 6 photos in total.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then there can be no Gagnon photos in the Sports section. Therefore, the Fuentes photos in the Sports section must be either one or two.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. This is not possible because one of the photos in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. This is possible. If one of the Fuentes photographs is in the Sports section, then the other Fuentes photograph must be in the Lifestyle section to balance the number of Fuentes and Hue photos in the Sports and Lifestyle sections.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible because it would mean that there are no Gagnon or Hue photos in the Metro section, and there must be at least one photographer with photos in both the Lifestyle and Metro sections.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. This is possible, as long as there is at least one Fuentes photograph in the Lifestyle section to balance the number of Fuentes and Hue photos in the Sports and Lifestyle sections.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible because there must be at least one Fuentes photograph in the Sports section to balance the number of Fuentes and Hue photos in the Sports and Lifestyle sections.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs will appear, two per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - The photographs were taken by three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer should have at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have two photographs, one by Fuentes and one by Hue. According to the given conditions, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. So, there must be one photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section and one photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section. Also, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, the second photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who also has a photograph in the Metro section, which could be Hue or Fuentes. Since Hue already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, the second photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes. This means that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, making option E the correct answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  Two photographs per section (total of 6 photographs).
  Each photographer has at least one photograph but no more than three photographs.
  At least one photograph in Lifestyle is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro.
  The number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle equals the number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon has exactly two photographs in one of the sections. This means that Gagnon has either 1 or 3 photographs in the remaining two sections. 
  A: If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then Gagnon has no photographs in Lifestyle. This violates the constraint that each photographer must have at least one photograph in each section.
  B: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then Gagnon has no photographs in Lifestyle. This violates the constraint that each photographer must have at least one photograph in each section.
  C: If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then Gagnon has no photographs in Metro. This violates the constraint that each photographer must have at least one photograph in each section.
  D: If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Gagnon has one photograph in Metro. This satisfies the constraint that each photographer has at least one photograph in each section.
  E: If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then Fuentes has no photographs in Sports. This violates the constraint that the number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle equals the number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports.

  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then:
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so both photographs must be in either the Lifestyle or Metro sections.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since Gagnon has both photographs in one of the sections, the other section must have at least one photograph by another photographer.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Since Gagnon has both photographs in one of the sections, neither Hue nor Fuentes can have both photographs in any section.
  
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. (Impossible, since Gagnon has both photographs in one of the sections and neither Hue nor Fuentes can have both photographs in any section.)
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. (Possible, since Gagnon has both photographs in one of the sections and Fuentes and Hue can have one photograph each in different sections.)
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. (Impossible, since Gagnon has both photographs in one of the sections and no photographer can have more than three photographs.)
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. (Possible, since Gagnon has both photographs in one of the sections and Hue can have one photograph in the Metro section. Fuentes must have one photograph in the Lifestyle section.)

Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each of the three sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) has exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("A")
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be either 1 or 3. However, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must also be either 1 or 3. If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then there would be no photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, which violates one of the constraints. Therefore, it is possible that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue and the other is by Fuentes.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear in three different sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Exactly two photographs per section.
  - Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the sections are by Gagnon, then:
    - Gagnon cannot appear in the Sports section.
    - Gagnon cannot appear in the other section that doesn't contain his photos (because each section must have photos from 2 different photographers).
    - Therefore, Gagnon's photos must appear in both photos of the Lifestyle section.
    - Therefore, Fuentes or Hue must have at least one photo in the Metro section.
    
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. (Impossible, because Gagnon's photos must appear in both photos of the Lifestyle section)
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. (Possible, because Fuentes or Hue must have at least one photo in the Metro section)
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. (Impossible, because each section must have photos from 2 different photographers)
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. (Impossible, because Gagnon's photos must appear in both photos of the Lifestyle section)
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. (Impossible, because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section) 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Six photographs in total are to be selected for three different sections.
  - Two photographs per section will be selected.
  - Three photographers are available: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.

  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E") 

If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, it means that Gagnon cannot have a photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, Fuentes and Hue must have photographs in the Sports section. According to the given conditions, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Since there are only two photographs in each section, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue and the other must be by Fuentes. Also, since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Gagnon. This means that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, which makes E the correct answer.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear, and exactly two photographs per section, in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Three photographers are available: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the two photographs in the Sports section must be taken by Fuentes and Hue. According to the condition, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Thus, there must be one photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section. Since each photographer can have at most three photographs, Hue can have only one photograph in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be taken by Fuentes. According to the condition, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Thus, Fuentes must have a photograph in the Metro section. Since each photographer can have at most three photographs, Fuentes can have at most two photographs in the Lifestyle and Metro sections combined. Therefore, the other photograph in the Metro section must be taken by Hue. This means that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, so (E) is the correct answer.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The harmonica should be auctioned after the lamp or at the same time.
  If harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or the vase.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. So, the earliest date the sundial can be auctioned is June 2nd. Also, according to the condition, the table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or the vase. So, the table can be auctioned only on June 1st, June 2nd or June 3rd. Now, let's analyze the options:
  
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
    If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp should be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. However, if the lamp is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica should also be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the table should be auctioned earlier than the harmonica. Therefore, this option is not possible.
    
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
    If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica should be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the table should also be auctioned on June 1st, which is possible because the table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica. Therefore, this option is possible.
    
  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
    If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp should be auctioned on June 3rd and June 4th in some order. However, if the lamp is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror should also be auctioned on June 4th, which is not possible because the sundial should be auctioned earlier than the mirror. Therefore, this option is not possible.
    
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
    If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica should be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, then the table should also be auctioned on June 4th, which is not possible because the table should be auctioned earlier than the harmonica. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 5th, then the mirror should also be auctioned on June 5th, which is not possible because the sundial should be auctioned earlier than the mirror. Therefore, this option is not possible.
    
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
    If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp should be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th. If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica should be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, then the table should also be auctioned on June 4th, which is not possible because the table should be auctioned earlier than the harmonica. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 5th, then the vase should be auctioned on June 6th, which is possible because the vase can be auctioned on any of the last three days. Therefore, this option is possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six antiques: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
  - Each antique is auctioned on a different day between June 1st and June 6th.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If harmonica < lamp, then mirror < lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the only antiques that can be auctioned on June 1st are: harmonica, lamp, table, or vase.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, if harmonica < lamp, then mirror < lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, sundial < mirror and sundial < vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, table < harmonica OR table < vase.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  - Since the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st. This is not possible because the table cannot be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.
  - If the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This is not possible because the table cannot be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 3rd.
  - If the sundial is auctioned on June 4th, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. This is not possible because the table cannot be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 4th.
  - If the sundial is auctioned on June 6th, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th. This is not possible because the table cannot be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  - Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 5th. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th. Since the table cannot be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, it must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. Therefore, one of the following must be true: harmonica < table < lamp OR table < harmonica < lamp.
  - If harmonica < table < lamp, then mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd, vase on June 4th, and lamp on June 5th. Therefore, the lamp is auctioned on June 5th, which is choice D.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp if the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial must be auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned after June 2nd. The sundial and table must be auctioned before June 2nd. The vase can be auctioned on any day. This arrangement is possible based on the given conditions. 
B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned earlier than June 2nd. This means that the mirror must also be auctioned earlier than June 2nd. However, the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror, which means that the sundial must be auctioned earlier than June 2nd. This is a contradiction, so this arrangement is not possible.
C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned after June 2nd. The sundial and table must be auctioned before June 2nd. The mirror must also be auctioned before the vase, which means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st. This arrangement is not possible because the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned earlier than June 3rd. This means that the mirror must also be auctioned earlier than June 3rd. The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror, which means that the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st. The table must be auctioned before the harmonica, which means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st. The vase can be auctioned on any day. This arrangement is possible based on the given conditions.
E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned after June 5th. The sundial and table must be auctioned before June 5th. The vase must be auctioned after the mirror, which means that the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. This arrangement is not possible because the vase must be auctioned on one of those days.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  3. The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  4. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - From (1), we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - From (3), we know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  - From (4), we know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. 
  - From (2), we know that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 2nd.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
  - June 1st is not the day for the sundial.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd because if it was, then the harmonica would be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp and the mirror would also have to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, which would violate the rule that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both. This means that the table could be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, but not on June 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th because it would violate the rule that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. This means that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or later because it would violate the rule that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.

Action: Answer("D")  
Choice D is the only option that is possible based on the given conditions. The lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd because it would violate the rule that the mirror is auctioned before the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp. The table could be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, but not on June 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th. Therefore, the lamp could be auctioned on June 3rd.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
- The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
- The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.

A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned later. However, the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, which means it must be auctioned on June 1st. This contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, A is not possible.
B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned earlier and the mirror must also be auctioned earlier. In this case, the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This satisfies all the given conditions, so B is possible.
C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial and the mirror must be auctioned earlier. However, the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, which means it must be auctioned on June 1st. This contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, C is not possible.
D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned earlier and the mirror must also be auctioned earlier. In this case, the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the table must be auctioned on June 2nd or later. This satisfies all the given conditions, so D is possible.
E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp and the harmonica must be auctioned later. However, the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, which means it must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, E is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The auction takes place over six consecutive days.
  - The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

Solution:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it can be auctioned on any of the remaining five days.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. This means that the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  - Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which violates the condition that the table must be auctioned after the sundial. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 3rd.
  - Since the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  - The harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  - The remaining antiques are the lamp and the vase. Since the table must be auctioned before the vase, the vase cannot be auctioned on June 4th. Therefore, the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - If the harmonica and the mirror are auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd. Therefore, (B) is a possible option.
  - If the harmonica and the mirror are auctioned on June 2nd and June 3rd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd. Therefore, (B) is a possible option.
  - If the harmonica and the mirror are auctioned on June 1st and June 3rd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd. Therefore, (B) is a possible option.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd, and the lamp, the vase, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 5th, and June 6th in some order. Therefore, (E) is a possible option.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and also earlier than the vase.
  The table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or earlier than the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and that it is auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. 
  We also know that the table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or earlier than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp. Therefore, if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. However, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, and the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd as well. However, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, and the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th. If the mirror is auctioned on June 3rd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th, and the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. Therefore, this scenario is possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.

  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Trades must be of exactly one of the three kinds: 
    1) Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2) Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3) Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to choose an option that is impossible to achieve, regardless of the trades made.
  
Analysis:
  A: RealProp owns only one class 1 building, and Trustcorp owns none of the buildings owned by RealProp, so this option cannot be true.
  B: Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2), and Trustcorp owns Meyer Building (class 2). None of these buildings are owned by RealProp, so this option is possible.
  C: Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2). None of these buildings are owned by Southco, so this option is possible.
  D: Yates House is owned by RealProp (not Trustcorp), and Flores Tower is owned by Southco (not Trustcorp), so this option cannot be true.
  E: Garza Tower is owned by RealProp (not Trustcorp), and Lynch Building is owned by Southco (not Trustcorp), so this option cannot be true.

  Trades can only be made between buildings of the same class or between classes as specified.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are all either class 1 or class 3, so they cannot be the Lynch, Meyer, or Ortiz Building, which are all class 2.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2), so this cannot be true.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2), and Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2), so this cannot be true.

Analysis:
  - We need to find a valid assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the ceremonies, so they must be both assigned to Silva or both assigned to Thorne.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  - We can use these rules to eliminate some of the choices.

Solution:
  - Choice A: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, so we need at least three more photographers. This choice does not satisfy the condition that at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony. Discard A.
  - Choice B: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, and Gonzalez must be assigned to Silva. This leaves Lai, Knutson, and Mays for the Thorne ceremony, but we don't know if Knutson must be assigned to Thorne or not. We cannot determine if this choice is valid or not. Keep B for now.
  - Choice C: Gonzalez and Knutson are assigned to Silva, but we need at least two more photographers. Discard C.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

If Tao was recruited second, the order of the recruits would be: [X, Tao, X, X, X, X, X], where X represents the remaining recruits. Peters was recruited fourth, so the order becomes [X, Tao, X, Peters, X, X, X]. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Rovero must be recruited either fifth or sixth. Villas was recruited immediately before White. This means that White was recruited seventh and Villas was recruited sixth. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so he must be recruited either third or fifth.

A: Quinn was recruited third. This means that Stanton must be recruited fifth, but this violates Condition 4.
B: Rovero was recruited fifth. This is a possible order of recruitment.
C: Stanton was recruited sixth. This means that White must be recruited seventh, but this violates Condition 4.
D: Villas was recruited sixth. This is a possible order of recruitment.
E: White was recruited third. This violates Condition 3.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited first. Since Peters was recruited fourth, we know that Tao was not recruited fourth. Therefore, the order of recruitment must be: Peters, Tao, [unknown], [unknown], [unknown], [unknown], [unknown]. We can now use the other clues to determine the possible order of recruitment for the remaining accomplices.
  
  A: If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited fourth, then Quinn cannot be recruited third because he was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  B: If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited fourth, then Rovero must be recruited fifth because Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  C: If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited fourth, then Stanton cannot be recruited sixth because he was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  D: If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited fourth, then Villas cannot be recruited sixth because White was recruited after Villas.
  E: If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited fourth, then White cannot be recruited third because Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited third.
  
  Therefore, Quinn could not have been recruited third, since Peters was recruited third.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Villas would have been recruited fourth, which violates the fact that Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Tao would have been recruited fifth, which violates the fact that Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then White would have been recruited seventh, which violates the fact that Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that White was recruited third.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 accomplices: Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - If Tao was recruited second, then the order could be Tao, Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton OR Tao, Quinn, Peters, Villas, Rovero, White, Stanton.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Tao was recruited second, then Villas was recruited first. Peters was recruited fourth, so the order so far is Villas, Tao, [unknown], Peters. White was recruited after Villas, so the order could be Villas, Tao, White, Peters, [unknown], [unknown], or Villas, Tao, Peters, [unknown], [unknown], White, [unknown]. In both cases, Villas was recruited immediately before one of the two remaining accomplices, meaning Villas could have been recruited sixth. Therefore, the answer is D, Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  
If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the accomplices is as follows: 

1. X
2. Tao
3. X
4. Peters
5. X
6. X
7. X

Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be recruited either first or third. Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn cannot be recruited third. Therefore, Quinn must be recruited first. 

1. Quinn
2. Tao
3. X
4. Peters
5. X
6. X
7. X

Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White must be recruited seventh. 

1. Quinn
2. Tao
3. X
4. Peters
5. X
6. Villas
7. White

Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Stanton must be recruited either third or sixth. If Stanton was recruited third, then Rovero must be recruited fifth. 

1. Quinn
2. Tao
3. Stanton
4. Peters
5. Rovero
6. Villas
7. White

If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Villas must be recruited fifth. 

1. Quinn

5. Villas
6. Stanton
7. White

So, both B and D could be true. 

Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  - There are seven accomplices in total.
  - If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited third.
  
  A: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited third. Therefore, Quinn cannot be recruited third because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. So, A cannot be true.
  B: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited third, and then there are only three remaining positions for Rovero to be recruited. Therefore, B could be true.
  C: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited third, and then there are only three remaining positions for Stanton to be recruited. However, Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so C cannot be true.
  D: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited third, and then there are only three remaining positions for Villas to be recruited. However, Villas was recruited immediately before White, so D cannot be true.
  E: If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited third. Therefore, White cannot be recruited third because Villas was recruited immediately before White. So, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited first, and there must be one person between Tao and Peters. 
  We know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited second, since Peters must be recruited first and there must be one person between Tao and Peters. 
  Therefore, we can eliminate option A.
  Since Peters was recruited fourth, and we know that there must be one person between Peters and Tao, Rovero cannot be recruited fifth, since there must be at least two people between Peters and Rovero. 
  Therefore, we can eliminate option B.
  Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, and Peters was recruited fourth, Stanton cannot be recruited sixth, since there must be at least one person between Peters and Stanton. 
  Therefore, we can eliminate option C.
  We know that Villas was recruited immediately before White, and Peters was recruited fourth, so there must be at least two people between Peters and Villas. Therefore, Villas cannot be recruited sixth, since there must be at least three people between Peters and Villas. 
  Therefore, we can eliminate option D.
  That leaves us with option E.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruits is: [?, Tao, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]
Analysis:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the first three recruits must be Quinn, Tao, and [?].
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White must be recruited last. This means the order of recruits is: [Quinn, Tao, ?, ?, ?, Villas, White].
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must be recruited either third or sixth.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruits is: [Quinn, Tao, ?, ?, ?, Villas, White]. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Rovero must be recruited either sixth or seventh. Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must be recruited sixth. This means the order of recruits is: [Quinn, Tao, ?, ?, ?, Villas, White]. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must be recruited sixth. Therefore, Stanton was recruited sixth, and the answer is C.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White
  - Peters was recruited fourth
  - There are seven accomplices
  - Each accomplice was recruited one at a time

Using the given information, we can create a timeline of the order in which the accomplices were recruited:

1. (unknown)
2. Tao
3. (unknown)
4. Peters
5. (unknown)
6. (unknown)
7. (unknown)

We know that Peters was recruited fourth, so we can add that to the timeline:

1. (unknown)
2. Tao
3. (unknown)
4. Peters
5. (unknown)
6. (unknown)
7. (unknown)

We also know that Villas was recruited immediately before White, so we can add that to the timeline:

1. (unknown)
2. Tao
3. (unknown)
4. Peters
5. (unknown)
6. Villas
7. White

We know that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so he must have been recruited either first, third, or seventh. We also know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero would have to be recruited sixth or seventh, which would mean that Villas was not recruited immediately before White, contradicting the given information. Therefore, we can eliminate choice A.

If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Stanton would have to be recruited first or seventh. If Stanton was recruited first, then Quinn would have to be recruited second, which would mean that Peters was not recruited fourth, contradicting the given information. Therefore, we can eliminate choice B. If Stanton was recruited seventh, then Quinn would have to be recruited sixth, which would mean that Villas was not recruited immediately before White, contradicting the given information. Therefore, we can eliminate choice C.

If Villas was recruited sixth, then White would have to be recruited seventh, which would mean that Stanton was recruited first, contradicting the given information. Therefore, we can eliminate choice D.

This leaves us with choice E: White was recruited third. If White was recruited third, then Quinn would have to be recruited second, which would mean that Peters was recruited fourth, and Rovero would be recruited fifth. This order satisfies all of the given information.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. There are seven accomplices: Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  2. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  3. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  4. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  5. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  6. Peters was recruited fourth.
  
If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be:
1. X
2. Tao
3. X
4. Peters
5. X
6. X
7. X

Where X represents any of the remaining accomplices.

A: If Quinn was recruited third, then the order would be: X, Tao, Quinn, Peters, X, X, X. This is possible.
B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order would be: X, Tao, X, Peters, X, Rovero, X. This is possible.
C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order would be: X, Tao, X, Peters, X, X, Stanton. This is possible.
D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order would be: X, Tao, X, Peters, X, Villas, X. This is possible.
E: If White was recruited third, then the order would be: X, Tao, White, Peters, X, X, X. This is not possible because Villas must be recruited before White.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
      a. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
      b. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
      c. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  2. If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then it means Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target.

Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then it means Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which means the only option that is possible is that Solide's website target is 2 days (since Truvest's website target cannot be 1 day). Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days, which means the only option that is possible is that Image's voicemail target is 1 day. None of the options mention Truvest, so we cannot determine anything about Truvest's targets. Finally, since Solide's website target is 2 days, it cannot be 1 day, so option E is not possible. Therefore, the only possible option is D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target. 
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. 
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. 
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  There are two service targets for each client.
  
Analysis: 
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day and its voicemail target must be 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must also be 1 day. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has a website target and a voicemail target.
  - Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  - The service targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

To satisfy the given conditions, we can create a table as follows:

| Client  | Website Target | Voicemail Target |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Image   | 1 day          | 2 days           |
| Solide  | 3 days         | 2 days           |
| Truvest | 2 days         | 3 days           |

Now, we can see that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which means Truvest's website target is 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be 1 day. Also, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 2 days.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - We are given that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  
Action: Answer("D")  

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target must be at least 2 days (because the website target can't exceed the voicemail target). This means that Image's voicemail target must also be at least 2 days (because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets). Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must be at least 2 days. Therefore, the only option that satisfies this condition is D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The clients are Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The targets are 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("D")

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, then Solide's website target must be 1 day. Therefore, Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, then Image's website target must be 1 day, and Solide's website target must be 1 day or 2 days. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that Solide's website target is 2 days, which is answer choice D.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
- Truvest has two service targets, a website target and a voicemail target.
- Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
- Image, Solide, and Truvest each have two targets, one for website requests and another for voicemail requests.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("D")
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target. Therefore, None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Thus, Solide's website target is 2 days, which is option D.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest has a website target and a voicemail target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target cannot be 1 day, and must be 2 or 3 days.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Image's voicemail target must be shorter than Truvest's voicemail target. Therefore, Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days and must be 1 or 2 days.
  
  If Image's voicemail target is 1 or 2 days, then Image's website target cannot be longer than Image's voicemail target.
  
  Based on the above analysis, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("D") Solide's website target is 2 days.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. 
  - Targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Action: 
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means Truvest's website target is 1 day and its voicemail target is 2 days. 
- Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must also be 1 day. 
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Image's website target must be 1 day, which means that Image's voicemail target must be 2 days. 
- Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Image's website target is 1 day. Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Truvest has two targets, one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.

Analysis:
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be shorter than 1 day, which is not possible since the shortest target is 1 day.
- Therefore, Truvest's website target is 2 days.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which is 2 days, so Solide's website target is 1 day.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, which are either 2 days or 3 days.
- Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 1 day.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Image's website target is also 1 day.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Each client has two service targets: one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days. According to the rules, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, if Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day, which is not possible since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 1 day, which means that Solide's website target must be 2 days. This leaves Image's website target at 3 days, and Image's voicemail target at 1 day. The only option that reflects this is D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the articles is subject to the following conditions:
  1. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  3. S must be earlier than Y.
  4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles must be one of the following:
  1. ____ ____ ____ Y ____ ____ ____  (where the first three articles can be G, H, J in some order, and the last three articles can be Q, R, S in some order, but not in the same order as the first three articles)
  2. ____ ____ ____ Q ____ S ____ Y ____  (where the first three articles can be G, H, J in some order, and the last three articles must be Q, S, Y in this order)
  3. ____ ____ ____ S ____ Q ____ Y ____  (where the first three articles can be G, H, J in some order, and the last three articles must be S, Q, Y in this order)
 
  A: J cannot be second, because G must be earlier than R, and if J is second, then G must be either first or second, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  B: J cannot be third, because if J is third, then G must be second, and R must be fourth, but the last three articles must be Q, R, S in some order, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  C: Q cannot be first, because if Q is first, then S must be second, and Y must be third, but the first three articles cannot cover the same topic, which violates the first condition.
  D: Q can be third, if the order is ____ ____ ____ Q ____ S ____ Y ____, where the first three articles can be G, H, J in some order, and the last three articles must be Q, S, Y in this order.
  E: R cannot be seventh, because if Y is fourth, then the last three articles must be Q, R, S in some order, and R cannot be seventh if S is not the last article. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  - Three other articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  - The remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

If Y is fourth, we know that S must be edited before Y. Therefore, S cannot be first. Also, Q cannot be second as S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third. Therefore, Q must be third. Since consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, G and J cannot be second and third in any order. Therefore, J must be first and G must be second. Since G must be earlier than R, R must be edited last. This leaves H to be edited fifth and Y to be edited sixth.

Action: Answer("B") - J is third.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  - Y is fourth.
  - There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the edited articles is one of the following:
  
  Option 1: Q, R, G, Y, S, J, H
  Option 2: R, Q, G, Y, S, J, H
  Option 3: G, R, Q, Y, S, J, H
  
  A: J is not second in any of the three possible orders.
  B: J is not third in any of the three possible orders.
  C: Q is not first in any of the three possible orders.
  D: Q is third in Option 1 and Option 2, but not in Option 3.
  E: R is seventh in all three possible orders.
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: Q is third.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance.
  2. Three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition.
  3. The remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
  4. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  5. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  6. S must be earlier than Y.
  7. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
If Y is fourth, the order of the articles can be one of the following:
- QRSYGHJ
- RQSYGHJ
- GHSYQRJ
- JRSYGHQ

A: If J is second, then G must be first, which means that R must be last. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, this cannot be true.
B: If J is third, then G must be first and H must be second. This means that R must be last. This satisfies all of the conditions, and therefore, this must be true.
C: If Q is first, then S must be second, which violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, this cannot be true.
D: If Q is third, then S must be second, which satisfies the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. This means that G must be first, H must be fourth, and J must be fifth. This violates the condition that J must be earlier than G. Therefore, this cannot be true.
E: If R is seventh, then it must be preceded by G and H. This means that Q must be third and S must be second. This violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, this cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The articles can be grouped into three categories: finance (G, H, and J), nutrition (Q, R, and S), and wildlife (Y).
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, the order of the articles must be one of the following:
  
  1. ___ ___ ___ Y ___ ___ ___ (Q, R, and S must be first three)
  2. ___ ___ ___ S Y ___ ___ (Q is third)
  3. ___ ___ ___ Q S Y ___ (Q is third)
  
  A: J cannot be second if Y is fourth because J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so J cannot be second. 
  B: J cannot be third if Y is fourth because J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so J cannot be third. 
  C: Q cannot be first if Y is fourth because Y is fourth and S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first.
  D: Q must be third if Y is fourth, so that S can be earlier than Q. This is consistent with the possible orders listed above.
  E: R cannot be seventh if Y is fourth because Y is fourth and S must be earlier than Y, so S must be at most sixth. Also, G must be earlier than R, so G must be at most fifth, which means that R cannot be seventh.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be either GHS or HGS.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. 
  S must be earlier than Y.
  
  A: J cannot be second because G must be earlier than J.
  B: J must be first or second, but we do not have enough information to determine whether it is first or second.
  C: Q cannot be first because S must be earlier than Q.
  D: Q must be third because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  E: R can be fifth or sixth, but we do not have enough information to determine whether it is seventh or not.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - G, H, and J are about finance.
  - Q, R, and S are about nutrition.
  - Y is about wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
If Y is fourth, then we have the following possible orders for the articles:
- 1st, 2nd, 3rd: finance articles (G, H, J)
- 4th: wildlife article (Y)
- 5th, 6th, 7th: nutrition articles (Q, R, S)

Option A: J is second.
- This is not possible, as the first article must be about finance.

Option B: J is third.

Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?

  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  Since screen 1 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and one at 9 P.M., the list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening must have two movies that satisfy all of the conditions listed above.
  
  A: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be on either screen 1 or 2. However, the horror film cannot be shown after the sci-fi film, so this list is not possible.
  
  B: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be on either screen 1 or 2. The horror film is not shown on screen 1, so it must be on screen 2. This list is possible.
  
  C: The western must be shown before the horror film, so this list is possible.
  
  D: The western must be shown before the horror film, so this list is possible.
  
  E: The western must be shown before the horror film, so this list is possible.
  
Action: Answer("A")

  - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each.
  - Screen 1 shows movies at 7 PM and 9 PM.
  - Western starts before horror film.
  - Sci-fi is not shown on screen 3.
  - Romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - Horror film and mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that Screen 1 shows two movies, one at 7 PM and another at 9 PM. 
  - We also know that the romance is not shown on Screen 2.
  - The western starts before the horror film.
  - Horror film and mystery are shown on different screens.
  
A: the sci-fi film, the horror film -> This is possible because the sci-fi film can be shown at 9 PM on Screen 1 and the horror film can be shown at 7 PM on Screen 1.
B: the sci-fi film, the mystery -> This is possible because the sci-fi film can be shown at 9 PM on Screen 1 and the mystery can be shown at 7 PM on Screen 1.
C: the western, the horror film -> This is possible because the western can be shown at 7 PM on Screen 1 and the horror film can be shown at 9 PM on Screen 1.
D: the western, the mystery -> This is possible because the western can be shown at 7 PM on Screen 1 and the mystery can be shown at 9 PM on Screen 1.
E: the western, the sci-fi film -> This is not possible because the western must be shown on Screen 1 and Screen 2, so it cannot be shown with the sci-fi film on Screen 1.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies (horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western) that play at three different times (7 PM, 8 PM, and 9 PM).
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one at 7 PM and the other at 9 PM.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 PM.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Let's look at the answer choices:
A: The sci-fi film, the horror film - This is possible. The horror film can be shown on either screen 1 or 2, and the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 1.
B: The sci-fi film, the mystery - This is possible. The mystery can be shown on either screen 1 or 2, and the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 1.
C: The western, the horror film - This is possible. The western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 PM, and the horror film can be shown on screen 2 at 7 PM.
D: The western, the mystery - This is possible. The western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 PM, and the mystery can be shown on screen 2 at 7 PM.
E: The western, the sci-fi film - This is not possible. The western must be shown before the horror film, and the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3. Therefore, the western and the horror film must be shown on screens 1 and 2, and the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1 because the western is already shown there. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that the horror and mystery films cannot be shown on screen 1 together. Thus, choices A and B are possible. 
  The western must be shown before the horror film, so C, D, and E are possible. 
  However, we know that the romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 3. 
  If the western is shown on screen 1, then the horror film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2, leaving only the romance and the sci-fi film for screen 3. 
  Therefore, the answer is not possible. It is not possible for the western and the sci-fi film to be shown on screen 1 together because the romance film must be shown on either screen 1 or 3. 
  Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Screen 1 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Eliminating choices using the given conditions:
  - The western movie cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The sci-fi movie cannot be shown on screen 3.
  - The horror and mystery movies are shown on different screens.
  
Testing the remaining choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
    - The western movie cannot be shown after the horror movie.
    - This choice violates the condition that the western begins at some time before the horror film does.

  The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2.
  The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 3.
  Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 2.
  The horror film must be shown on screen 1 or 2, but not with the mystery.

Solution:
  A: The sci-fi film and the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 together because the horror film must be shown before the western, which must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  B: The sci-fi film can be shown on screen 1 or 2, and the mystery must be shown on screen 2, so this is a possible list.

  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  
Eliminating Choices:
  A: The Western cannot be on screen 1 because it has to start before the horror movie and cannot be on screen 3. Eliminated.
  B: The mystery cannot be on screen 1 because it is not shown on the same screen as the horror movie. Eliminated.
  C: This is a valid option because the Western can start on screen 1 at 7 PM and the horror movie can start on screen 1 at 9 PM.
  D: This is a valid option because the Western can start on screen 1 at 7 PM and the mystery can start on screen 2 at 7 PM.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The theater has three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis: 
  According to the given conditions, we know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, and the romance is not shown on screen 2. Thus, the romance film cannot be shown on screen 1. We need to select the option that includes the romance film in the list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1. Therefore, option B cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: 
  We know that screen 1 shows two movies, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., and that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the horror film and the mystery cannot both be shown on screen 1. 
  Choice A is possible because the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the horror film can be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  Choice B is possible because the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the mystery can be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  Choice C is possible because the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the horror film can be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  Choice D is possible because the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the mystery can be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  Choice E is not possible because the western cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3. Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film cannot both be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M.
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  Three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  We are looking for a list of movies that cannot be scheduled to show on screen 1 this evening. 
  Since screen 1 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., we need to consider both movie times.
  The western must be shown before the horror movie, so if the western is shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1, then the horror movie must be shown on either screen 2 or screen 3.
  The sci-fi movie cannot be shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2.
  The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 2.
  Using these constraints, we can eliminate choices that cannot be accurate lists of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1.

Solution:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film 
    - If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the horror film must be shown on screen 2 or 3. This is possible.
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
    - If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the mystery must be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. This is possible.
  C: the western, the horror film
    - If the western is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the horror film must be shown on screen 2 or 3. This is possible.
  D: the western, the mystery
    - If the western is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the mystery must be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. This is possible.
  E: the western, the sci-fi film
    - If the western is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. This is possible.
    
  None of the choices can be eliminated, so the answer is "None of the Above".

Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The company has exactly 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The representatives work in 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

A: Kim and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
B: Kim and Stuckey can both work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
C: Mahr and Stuckey can both work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
D: Mahr and Udall cannot both work in Zone 3 because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
E: Parra and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1
  - Exactly one of Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same zone
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone
  - There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2
  - There are exactly 7 representatives and 3 zones, so there must be at least two representatives in one zone.

A: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 1. This contradicts the first condition. So, this statement must be false.
B: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least two other representatives working in Zone 3. This means there are at least 4 representatives in total in Zone 3 and at most 2 representatives in total in Zone 2. This satisfies the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This statement could be true.
C: If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least one other representative working in Zone 3. This means there are at least 3 representatives in total in Zone 3 and at most 3 representatives in total in Zone 2. This contradicts the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, this statement must be false.
D: If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least two other representatives working in Zone 3. This means there are at least 4 representatives in total in Zone 3 and at most 2 representatives in total in Zone 2. This satisfies the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This statement could be true.
E: If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 1. This contradicts the second condition. So, this statement must be false.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three breeds of kittens: Himalayan, Manx, and Siamese.
  - There are three breeds of puppies: Greyhound, Newfoundland, and Rottweiler.
  - There are exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 through day 7).
  - Each day features exactly one breed of kitten and one breed of puppy.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If four breeds each are featured on three days, then there would have to be at least 12 breed appearances total. However, there are only 7 days, so this is impossible.
B: Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, it is impossible for Greyhounds to be featured on every day that Himalayans are.
C: This is also impossible because Himalayans are only featured on three days, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
D: Himalayans are not featured on day 1, which means that Greyhounds are not featured on every day that Himalayans are. Additionally, Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, but this does not necessarily mean that Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
E: This statement is true. Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, and Himalayans are featured on exactly three days. Therefore, Rottweilers must be featured on every day that Himalayans are not, which is days 2, 4, 6, and 7.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies.
  - Each breed of kitten and puppy is featured exactly once for each of the seven days.
  - The breeds of puppies and kittens that are featured on day 1 are Greyhound and one of the three breeds of kitten (not Himalayan).
  - Himalayan is featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.

Analysis:
  - Choice A is not possible because there are only 6 breeds of kittens and puppies combined, and each breed is featured exactly once for each of the seven days.
  - Choice B is not possible because there is no overlap between the days that Greyhounds and Himalayans are featured, and Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  - Choice C is not possible because there is no overlap between the days that Greyhounds and Himalayans are featured.
  - Choice D is possible because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, but it does not necessarily mean that Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  - Choice E is not possible because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- There are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies.

- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Since there are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies, there are a total of 6 breeds that need to be featured exactly once on each of the 7 days.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on any other day that Himalayans are not featured on.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, so they cannot be featured on any day that Rottweilers are featured on.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, so they must be featured on at least 2 of the first 6 days that are not day 1.
- Since no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, the first and last days must have different breeds.
- Since any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, there are only 5 breeds that can be featured on day 7.

Action: Answer("E")

  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, that would mean that one breed is featured only once. However, Himalayans are featured on at least 2 days, so this cannot be true.
B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans would be featured on day 1, which is not possible.
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans would be featured on day 1, which is not possible.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans would be featured on day 7, which is not possible.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, this could be true. Himalayans are featured on exactly 3 days, so there are 4 days where they are not featured. Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, so they must be featured on the remaining 4 days.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The maintenance company has 3 clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- Each client has a website and a voicemail target, making a total of 6 targets.
- The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- Two targets are set for each client, one for the website and one for voicemail.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
- If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, the possible voicemail targets are 1 day and 2 days.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is 1 day.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is 1 day and Truvest's website target is 2 days.
- Therefore, Solide's voicemail target can be 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target can be 1 day or 2 days.

Action: Answer("A") - Image's website target can be 1 day or 2 days, so it is not necessarily true that Image's website target is 1 day.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the voicemail targets can only be 1 day or 2 days.
  
Analysis:
  - If Image's website target is 1 day, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day as well. This satisfies the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be longer than 2 days. This satisfies the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 
  - If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, then Truvest's voicemail target must be longer than 2 days. This satisfies the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be shorter than 2 days. This satisfies the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be longer than 2 days, which contradicts the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
- If none of the clients have a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
- Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target cannot be longer than 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 or 2 days.
- Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and the longest voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 or 2 days.
- Since None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, then Image's website target must be 1 or 2 days.
- Based on the above, it is possible that Solide's website target is 2 days, but it is not a must. Therefore, the answer is B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company is setting service targets for response times to service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, this means that the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  
Analysis:
  - Option A: If Image's website target is 1 day, it is possible that Image's voicemail target is 2 days, which is consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, this option could be true.
  - Option B: If Solide's website target is 2 days, it is consistent with the given conditions because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, this option could be true.
  - Option C: If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, it is consistent with the given conditions because the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Therefore, this option could be true.
  - Option D: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, it is consistent with the given conditions because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, this option could be true.
  - Option E: If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, it is consistent with the given conditions because the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Therefore, this option could be true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above") since all of the options could be true based on the given conditions.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The service targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")

If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, it means that all the voicemail targets are either 2 days or 1 day. According to the conditions given, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day and Truvest's website target must be 2 days. Also, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day and the other clients' voicemail targets must be 2 days. Based on these conditions, we can conclude that Solide's voicemail target is 2 days (since it cannot be 1 day) and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days (since it cannot be 1 day). Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is (A) Image's website target is 1 day. It could be 2 days if the voicemail target is also 2 days. Therefore, the answer is (A).
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  Since none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Therefore, the longest website target is also 2 days. The targets can be summarized in the following table:

| Client | Website | Voicemail |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Image  | 1 day   | 1 or 2 days |
| Solide | 2 days  | 1 or 2 days |
| Truvest| 2 days  | 1 or 2 days |


Action: Answer("A") 

Explanation: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target is either 1 or 2 days. Therefore, Image's website target must also be 1 day since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is 2 days and Truvest's website target is 2 days. Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is that Image's website target is 1 day. It could be 2 days if Image's voicemail target is also 2 days.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A") 

If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then it must be true that:
- Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days (because it must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets).
- Solide's and Truvest's voicemail targets are either 1 day or 2 days.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's website target is either 2 days or 3 days.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Solide's website target cannot be 3 days. 

Therefore, each of the following statements are true:
- Solide's website target is 2 days (because it cannot be 3 days, and it must be shorter than Truvest's website target).
- Solide's voicemail target is 1 day or 2 days.
- Truvest's voicemail target is 1 day or 2 days.
- Truvest's website target is 2 days or 3 days.

The only statement that is not necessarily true is A: "Image's website target is 1 day." It is possible that Image's website target is 2 days (in which case its voicemail target would be either 1 day or 2 days). Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- The service targets for each client are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.

Analysis:
- If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. This is because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be 1 day as well. If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day or 2 days. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Solide's website target is 2 days.
- Using the same logic, we cannot conclude that Truvest's website target is 2 days or that Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
- However, we can conclude that Image's website target is 1 day, because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days. According to the conditions, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 1 day, and Solide's website target must be 2 days. 
Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. Therefore, Image's website target cannot be 1 day, because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Hence, the answer is A.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The service targets for three clients (Image, Solide, and Truvest), will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("C")
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then it means that the voicemail target of each client is either 1 day or 2 days. This implies that Solide's voicemail target cannot be 3 days, which means Solide's website target cannot be 3 days as well. Therefore, Solide's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days, so option B must be true. Also, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target must be 1 day and the voicemail target of the other clients must be 2 days. Thus, Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, which means Truvest's website target cannot be longer than 2 days. Therefore, options D and E must be true. Since Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's website target cannot be longer than 2 days, then option C might not be true. However, options A must be true because Image's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and if the voicemail target of Image is 1 day, then the website target of Image must be 1 day. Therefore, the answer is C.

Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. - This is not possible since there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. 
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - This is not possible since there are only six photographs and Gagnon is not allowed to have any photographs in the Sports section.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. - This is possible since there are no restrictions on the number of photographs that each photographer can have in the Metro section.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - This is not possible since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there must be one photograph by Fuentes and one photograph by Hue in the Sports section.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - This is possible since there are no restrictions on the number of photographs that each photographer can have in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - A total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, it means that there are no photographs in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon. This also means that there is at least one photograph in the Metro section taken by either Fuentes or Hue. If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then Fuentes has three photographs in the Metro section, which is not allowed. If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then there are no photographs in the Metro section by either Fuentes or Hue, which is also not allowed. Therefore, the only possible option is that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue (choice C).
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Six different photographs are to appear in three sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports), with exactly two photographs per section.
- Three photographers (Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue) took the photographs.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes or Hue. Since there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by a photographer who also has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, the only possible combination is that the other photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, and both photographs in the Metro section are by Hue and Gagnon. This means that there are no Hue photographs in the Sports section, so neither choice D nor choice E can be true. Additionally, since Gagnon photographs cannot be in the Sports section, choice B cannot be true. Therefore, the only possible choice is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are a total of six different photographs, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there are two possibilities for the third photograph in the Lifestyle section: either it is by Gagnon, or it is by Fuentes. 
- If the third photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, then there must be at least one photograph by Fuentes in the Metro section, and the other photograph in the Metro section can be by either Gagnon or Hue. This means that both photographs in the Metro section could be by Fuentes, so A is possible.
- If the third photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon, then neither photograph in the Metro section can be by Gagnon, and one photograph in the Metro section must be by Hue. This means that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, so C is possible. 
- Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must also be by Hue. This means that D is not possible. 
- Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, then E is also not possible. 
Therefore, the answer is C.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. 6 photographs in total, 2 per section.
  2. 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  3. For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  4. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  5. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  6. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes or Hue. Therefore, there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section that is by either Fuentes or Hue to satisfy condition 4. This means that Gagnon cannot have both photographs in the Metro section (otherwise, there would be no photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes or Hue). Therefore, it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) must have exactly two photographs.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
- Fuentes cannot have a photograph in the Metro section, because that would mean Fuentes has photographs in both the Lifestyle and Metro sections, which violates the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- Hue cannot have both photographs in the Metro section, because that would mean Hue has no photographs in the Lifestyle section, which violates the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible because Fuentes cannot have a photograph in the Metro section.
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. This is not possible because Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, and there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is possible. If one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, and Hue cannot have both photographs in the Metro section, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon. Therefore, both of Gagnon's photographs are in the Metro section, and neither of Gagnon's photographs are in the Sports section.
D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and we already know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes.
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. This is possible. If neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue, then Fuentes must have both photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
- Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
- Fuentes cannot have more than one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
- Hue cannot have more than one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
- One photograph in the Lifestyle section is not by Gagnon.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. => This is not possible because Fuentes already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section.
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. => This is not possible because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon has no photographs in the Sports section.
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. => This is possible. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, and at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, then the photograph in the Lifestyle section that is not by Fuentes or Hue must be by a photographer who has a photograph in the Metro section, which could be Hue. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. => This is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and we already know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. => This is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there are two possibilities:
  - The third photographer Gagnon has both photographs in the Metro section.
  - The third photographer Gagnon has one photograph in the Metro section and the other one in the Sports section.

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. => This is not possible because there is already one photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section.
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. => This is possible because we have not assigned any photograph to Gagnon yet.
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. => This is not possible because we have already assigned one photograph to Fuentes and one to Hue in the Lifestyle section.
D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. => This is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. => This is possible because we have not assigned any photograph to Hue yet.

  - Each of the three photographers has at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - There are six photographs in total, with two photographs per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  - If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then Gagnon must have both photographs in the Sports section.
  - From the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, we know that there is one photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section and one photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section.
  - From the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, we know that the photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section must be with one photograph from Fuentes or Gagnon in the Metro section.
  - Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. 
  - Thus, option C is correct.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.

- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it means that there are no photographs in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon. Thus, one of the Gagnon's photographs must be in the Metro section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue. Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Sports section must be one or zero. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, then the only possibility is that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. Therefore, the answer is (C).

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist must be included.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, if two botanists are selected, at most one zoologist can be selected. 
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.

A: F, G, K, P, Q
  This selection has two botanists and two chemists, but no zoologist. Therefore, it is not acceptable.
  
B: G, H, K, L, M
  This selection includes at least one scientist of each type, and only one botanist is selected, so there can be at most one zoologist. Also, F and R are not selected, so M being selected does not violate the condition that both P and R must be selected. Therefore, this is an acceptable selection.
  
C: G, H, K, L, R
  This selection includes at least one scientist of each type, and only one botanist is selected, so there can be at most one zoologist. However, M is not selected, so both P and R cannot be selected. Therefore, this is not an acceptable selection.
  
D: H, K, M, P, R
  This selection includes at least one scientist of each type, and only one botanist is selected, so there can be at most one zoologist. Also, if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, which is the case. Therefore, this is an acceptable selection.
  
E: H, L, M, P, Q
  This selection includes at least one scientist of each type, and only one botanist is selected, so there can be at most one zoologist. However, F is not selected, so the condition that F and K cannot both be selected is not satisfied. Therefore, this is not an acceptable selection.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. It does not affect Mollie's assignment.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. It does not affect Mollie's assignment.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. It does not affect Mollie's assignment.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then only Louis can be assigned to 1924. This means that Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and since 1921 is already taken by Yoshio (as none of the other choices allows Mollie to be assigned to 1921), Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922. This choice satisfies the condition that Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, but this is not the only valid choice that satisfies this condition.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
- Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if one of the following is true:
  - Tiffany is not assigned to 1923 and Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  - Tiffany is assigned to 1923 and Ryan is not assigned to any year.
  - Tiffany is assigned to 1923, Ryan is assigned to a year, and that year is not 1924.

A: Louis is assigned to 1924. - This does not help in determining if Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. - This is one of the conditions that would make Mollie have to be assigned to 1922.
C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. - This does not help in determining if Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. - This does not meet any of the conditions that would make Mollie have to be assigned to 1922.
E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. - This does not help in determining if Mollie must be assigned to 1922.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. This does not determine where Mollie is assigned.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. This does not determine where Mollie is assigned.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. This does not determine where Mollie is assigned.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. This means Louis is assigned to 1924, and Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, this does not determine where Mollie is assigned.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. This means Mollie must be assigned to 1922, and Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923. This satisfies all of the conditions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned.
- If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years (1922, 1923, 1924) must be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Tiffany/Ryan, and Onyx, respectively. This is possible.
- If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then the remaining years (1921, 1923, 1924) must be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx, respectively. This is possible.
- If Mollie is assigned to 1923 or 1924, then the remaining years cannot be assigned to Louis/Tiffany because only Louis/Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and there is no year left for Louis/Tiffany if Mollie is assigned to 1924. So, one of the conditions will be violated.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  A: There is no information about Louis being assigned to 1924.
  B: If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921, so this option is not valid.
  C: If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to 1924-1=1923, but only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so this option is not valid.
  D: If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, but Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922, so Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922, so this option is not valid.
  E: If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922, so this option is valid.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
- The four years must be assigned exactly one student each from the six available students.
- We need to determine which of the options would lead to Mollie being assigned to 1922.

Analysis:
- Option A does not determine anything about Mollie's assignment.
- Option B would mean that Onyx is assigned to 1921, which means Ryan must be assigned to 1922, and then Mollie must be assigned to 1921. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
- Option C does not determine anything about Mollie's assignment because Onyx would be assigned to 1923 if Ryan is assigned to 1924.
- Option D would mean that Tiffany is assigned to 1923 and Louis must be assigned to 1924. This would mean that Mollie must be assigned to 1921, which contradicts the condition that Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Option E does not determine anything about Mollie's assignment.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
- There are exactly four years to be assigned, one for each student.

To satisfy the given conditions, we can start by assigning Tiffany to 1923, and then Ryan to 1924. This leaves only Louis available for 1921, and Mollie and Onyx available for 1922 and 1923 (in some order). Since Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and Louis is already assigned to 1921, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
- If Louis is assigned to 1924, then neither Louis nor Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, which means Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, and therefore, neither can Onyx. This means that Mollie must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, A is not the answer.
- If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Ryan must be assigned to 1922. This means that neither Louis nor Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and thus, Mollie must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, B could be the answer.
- If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, which means that Tiffany must be assigned to the project, and thus, Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, C is not the answer.
- If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922, and thus Mollie must be assigned to 1921. Therefore, D is not the answer.
- If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, E could be the answer.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  2. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  3. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  4. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years must be assigned to Louis/Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx. Since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, Louis/Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. Then, Ryan must be assigned to the year immediately after Onyx, which is 1924. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1922. This means that the remaining year, 1924, must be assigned to Yoshio.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. 
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. 
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
A: Louis is assigned to 1924. This does not help us determine which year Mollie should be assigned to.
B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. This does not help us determine which year Mollie should be assigned to.
C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. This does not help us determine which year Mollie should be assigned to.
D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. This means Louis cannot be assigned to 1923. Since Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922, and she cannot be assigned to the same year as Tiffany, then she must be assigned to 1922.
E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. This does not help us determine which year Mollie should be assigned to.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Bay 4 is holding produce, so the bay holding fuel must be either 1 or 2.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, meaning it must be either 3 or 5.
  The bay holding livestock must be either 1, 2, or 3, since it has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain must be either 4, 5, or 6, since it has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding machinery must be the only remaining option, which is either 1, 2, or 3.
  
Analysis:
  Since bay 4 is holding produce, the bay holding fuel must be either 1 or 2. 
  If the bay holding fuel is 1, then the bay holding textiles must be 3 and the bay holding livestock must be 2. 
  In this case, the only remaining option for the bay holding grain is 6, and the only remaining option for the bay holding machinery is 5.
  If the bay holding fuel is 2, then the bay holding textiles must be 5 and the bay holding livestock must be 3.
  In this case, the only remaining option for the bay holding grain is 4, and the only remaining option for the bay holding machinery is 1.
  In both cases, we can determine the cargo for all six bays.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, the bay holding fuel must be bay 1.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles must be bay 3.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so the bay holding livestock must be bay 5, and the bay holding textiles must be bay 3.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain must be bay 6.
  The bay holding machinery must be bay 2.
Action: Answer("E")  
If bay 4 is holding produce, then the type of cargo that each of the other bays is holding is completely determined:
  Bay 1 is holding fuel.
  Bay 2 is holding machinery.
  Bay 3 is holding textiles.
  Bay 5 is holding livestock.
  Bay 6 is holding grain.
Therefore, the answer is E. All six bays are completely determined.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are only six bays and six types of cargo.
  
We can use the given information to determine the order of the bays and the type of cargo they are holding. We know that bay 4 is holding produce, and from the given information we can deduce the following order:

Bay 6: Fuel
Bay 5: Textiles
Bay 4: Produce
Bay 3: Livestock
Bay 2: Grain
Bay 1: Machinery

We can see that the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, and 6 are completely determined, since they are the only bays left and there is only one type of cargo left for each. For bay 3, we know that it is holding livestock, since it has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. For bay 5, we know that it is holding textiles, since it is next to the bay holding produce. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 is the bay with the lowest number, and Bay 6 is the bay with the highest number.
  There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  If Bay 4 is holding produce, then we know that Bay 5 must be holding textiles since it is the only bay next to produce.
  Bay 6 cannot hold livestock since it has the highest number, so Bay 3 or Bay 2 must hold livestock. 
  If Bay 3 holds livestock, then Bay 2 must hold fuel and Bay 1 must hold grain. But this violates the condition that grain must have a higher number than livestock. Therefore, Bay 2 must hold livestock and Bay 1 must hold fuel. 
  Therefore, the only unknown bay is Bay 6, which can only hold machinery.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  
Solution:
  According to the information given, we can deduce the following order of bays and their respective cargos:
  Bay 1: Fuel
  Bay 2: Textiles
  Bay 3: Livestock
  Bay 4: Produce
  Bay 5: Grain
  Bay 6: Machinery
  
  Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 3, 5, and 6 are completely determined, while the type of cargo for bays 2 is not completely determined. 
  Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  According to the given information, we know that:
  Bay 4 is holding produce, so Bay 5 is holding textiles.
  Bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so Bay 3 is holding fuel.
  Bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so Bay 2 is holding livestock and Bay 1 is holding grain.
  Therefore, we can determine the type of cargo for all six bays, so the answer is D: five.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Bay numbers and types of cargo are related by a set of rules.
  We need to determine the number of bays whose cargo types are completely determined if bay 4 is holding produce.
  
  We know that produce is next to textiles and textiles is next to livestock. Therefore, the order of the bays from left to right must be fuel, grain, livestock, textiles, produce, machinery or machinery, produce, textiles, livestock, grain, fuel.
  
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then we know that bays 5 and 3 are holding textiles and livestock, respectively. We also know that bay 2 cannot be holding livestock because the bay holding grain must have a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, bay 2 is holding fuel and bay 1 is holding grain. Bay 6 must be holding machinery because that is the only type of cargo left.
  
  So, the types of cargo for all 6 bays are completely determined.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are six different bays numbered consecutively from 1 to 6 on a loading dock.
  - There are exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Solution:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the following must be true:
  - The bay holding fuel must be bay 1.
  - The bay holding textiles must be bay 3.
  - The bay holding livestock must be bay 5.
  - The bay holding grain must be bay 6.

  Therefore, the type of cargo that each bay is holding is completely determined for 4 bays: bays 1, 3, 4, and 6.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 and each bay is holding a different type of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  
Reasoning:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding fuel must be either bay 1 or bay 2.
  Since the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, the bay holding grain must be either bay 5 or bay 6.
  Since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, the bay holding livestock must be either bay 1 or bay 2.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding machinery must be bay 2 and the bay holding fuel must be bay 1. This means that the bay holding grain must be bay 6 and the bay holding livestock must be bay 5. Therefore, for exactly 4 of the six bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding machinery must be bay 6 and the bay holding fuel must be bay 1. This means that the bay holding grain must be bay 2 and the bay holding livestock must be bay 1. Therefore, for exactly 4 of the six bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  There are exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  
Analysis:
  Since Bay 4 is holding produce, we know that the bay holding fuel must be 1, 2, or 3. This is because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  Since the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, and Bay 4 is holding produce, we know that Bay 3 or Bay 5 is holding textiles. However, we do not know which one.
  Since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, and Bay 5 is the highest number that the bay holding textiles can be, we know that Bay 6 is holding livestock and Bay 2 is holding textiles.
  Since the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and Bay 6 is the highest number that the bay holding livestock can be, we know that Bay 1 is holding grain.

  The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  A: Myers cannot be on the team with Paine, so this option is impossible.
  B: Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team with Myers, so this option is impossible.
  C: This selection satisfies all of the constraints, so it is a possible selection.
  D: This selection satisfies the constraint for Schmidt, but it does not satisfy the constraint for Wong, so this option is impossible.
  E: This selection satisfies the constraint for Wong, but it does not satisfy the constraint for Schmidt, so this option is impossible.

  - If Schmidt is selected, Paine and Thomson must also be selected.
  - If Wong is selected, Myers and Yoder must also be selected.
  
A: Myers is included, but Paine cannot be included. Schmidt is included but Paine is also included, which conflicts with the constraint. Thomson is included which means that Paine must be included, but Paine cannot be included because Myers is already included. This selection is not possible.
B: Ortega and Paine are both included, but Myers is not included, which conflicts with the constraint. Schmidt is not included, which conflicts with the constraint. This selection is not possible.
C: Paine and Schmidt are included, which means that Thomson must also be included. Yoder is included because Wong is not included. This selection is possible.
D: Schmidt and Thomson are included, which means that Paine must also be included. Yoder is included because Wong is not included. This selection is possible.
E: Wong is included, which means that Myers and Yoder must also be included. Thomson is included, which means that Paine must also be included. This selection is possible.

Action: Answer("C"), Answer("D"), and Answer("E") are all possible selections of employees for the team.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees.
  The team will be selected from the following eight employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  A: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Thus, Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on it.
     If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Thus, Thomson cannot be on the team without Paine.
     Therefore, A is not a possible selection.
  B: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Thus, Myers cannot be on the team if Ortega is on it.
     If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Thus, Paine must be on the team if Schmidt is on it.
     Therefore, B is not a possible selection.
  C: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Thus, Yoder must be on the team if Wong is on it.
     If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Thus, Paine must be on the team if Schmidt is on it.
     Therefore, C is a possible selection.
  D: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Thus, Myers must be on the team if Wong is on it.
     If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Thus, Paine must be on the team if Schmidt is on it.
     Therefore, D is a possible selection.
  E: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Thus, Myers must be on the team if Wong is on it.
     If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Thus, Paine must be on the team if Schmidt is on it.
     Therefore, E is a possible selection.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  A: Myers and Schmidt cannot be on the same team because if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be, but if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. 
  B: Ortega cannot be on the team because if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  C: Only Schmidt and Zayre are left for the last two spots, but if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  D: This is a possible selection of employees for the team.
  E: Wong must be on the team with both Myers and Yoder. Therefore, this is not possible because there are only four spots on the team.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The research team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  - If Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine can be selected.
  - If Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must be selected.
  - If Wong is selected, both Myers and Yoder must be selected.
  
Option A: Myers is selected, so neither Ortega nor Paine can be selected. Schmidt is also selected, so both Paine and Thomson must be selected. However, Wong and Yoder are not selected, so this option is not possible.

Option B: Neither Myers nor Schmidt is selected, so there are no constraints on the selection. However, only four employees are selected, so this option is not possible.

Option C: Schmidt is selected, so both Paine and Thomson must be selected. Wong is not selected, so there are no constraints on the selection of Myers and Yoder. This option is possible.

Option D: Schmidt is selected, so both Paine and Thomson must be selected. Wong is selected, so both Myers and Yoder must be selected. This option is possible.

Option E: Wong is selected, so both Myers and Yoder must be selected. However, Thomson is also selected, so Schmidt must also be selected. This violates the constraint that if Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must be selected. This option is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The team must include at least four employees from a group of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  A: Myers is on the team, so Paine and Ortega cannot be on the team. Schmidt is also on the team, so both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. This violates the condition that Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team. Therefore, A is not a possible selection.
  B: Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team, and Wong must be on the team if Yoder is on the team. Therefore, B is not a possible selection.
  C: This selection satisfies all the conditions, so it is a possible selection.
  D: This selection satisfies all the conditions, so it is a possible selection.
  E: Wong must be on the team if Yoder is on the team, but Myers must also be on the team if Wong is on the team. Therefore, E is not a possible selection.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The research team must include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  - If Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine can be selected.
  - If Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must also be selected.
  - If Wong is selected, both Myers and Yoder must also be selected.

Elimination:
  - Option A: Myers cannot be selected with Paine, so this option is not possible.
  - Option B: Myers is not included in this option, so it is possible. Ortega is selected, which is allowed because Myers is not selected.
  - Option C: Myers is not included in this option, so it is possible. Paine and Schmidt are selected together which is not allowed.
  - Option D: Schmidt is selected, and both Paine and Thomson are included, which is allowed. Myers and Yoder are not included, but that is allowed since Wong is not selected.
  - Option E: Wong is selected, so Myers and Yoder must also be selected. However, Thomson is not included, so this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The research team will include at least 4 employees.
  - The team will be chosen from a list of 8 employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Process of elimination:
  - Option A: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, A is not possible.
  - Option B: Ortega and Paine cannot be on the same team if Myers is on it. We do not know if Myers is on the team. Therefore, B is a possible selection.
  - Option C: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, C is not possible.
  - Option D: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, D is a possible selection.
  - Option E: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, E is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives to work in its three sales zones.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Action: 
If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at least two sales representatives working in Zone 1. 
  - From the given conditions, either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and if Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall works in Zone 2. This means that Parra works in Zone 3, and Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, which is Zone 3. 
  - Therefore, Mahr, Stuckey, and Kim must work in Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3, respectively. 
  - So, the only option that could be true is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.

Answer: D
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We are given a set of conditions that dictate where each of the seven sales representatives works in the three sales zones.
  We are also given the information that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We are asked to determine which statement could be true given the condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  
Process of elimination:
- Choices A and B are not possible because Tiao and Udall cannot both be in Zone 2, and there are only two sales representatives in Zone 2.
- Choice C is not possible because if Parra were in Zone 3, then Tiao would have to be in Zone 1, which would mean that there are more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, contradicting the given condition.
- Choice E is not possible because if Udall were in Zone 3, then Stuckey would also have to be in Zone 3, which would mean that there are an equal number of sales representatives in Zone 2 and Zone 3, contradicting the given condition.

Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, the only possible choice is that Tiao works in Zone 1. This would mean that Parra works in Zone 3, and since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn must also work in Zone 3. This leaves Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall to work in Zone 2, and there is no restriction on which of them can work in that zone. Thus, Tiao works in Zone 1, which means that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, and Choice D is correct.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. 
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: 
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because if Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra would have to work in Zone 3, which would make the number of sales representatives in Zone 3 greater than the number of sales representatives in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2. If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and Tiao works in Zone 2, then Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because there would be three sales representatives in Zone 2. Therefore, Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3. If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must work in Zone 1. Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao work in Zone 2. 
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because Kim works in Zone 1 or 3.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 2 because Kim, Mahr, and Tiao work in Zone 2, and there cannot be more than two sales representatives in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 1, not Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 2.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is E. Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are exactly 7 sales representatives and 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 must have at least 3 sales representatives. Since only one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, the other must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. Similarly, since only one of Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, the other must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and there are at least 3 representatives in Zone 1, then both Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 1. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so they cannot both work in Zone 1 since it already has at least 3 representatives. Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there can be at most 2 representatives in Zone 2. 

A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there can be at most 2 representatives in Zone 2.
B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 2 because there can be at most 2 representatives in Zone 2.
C: Parra must work in Zone 1, not Zone 3.
D: Tiao must work in Zone 1, not Zone 3.
E: Udall must work in Zone 3, which is consistent with the analysis.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We know that there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the maximum number of sales representatives in Zone 3 can be 2, and the minimum number of sales representatives in Zone 1 can be 3. Therefore, Parra or Tiao must be in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall must be in Zone 2. Also, we know that Parra and Quinn, as well as Stuckey and Udall, must be in the same sales zone. Therefore, we can conclude that Mahr and Kim must be in Zone 3. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: 
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Also, Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then both Parra and Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. It means that Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3. Therefore, the number of sales representatives in Zone 3 must be at least 3. 
  A: Kim works in Zone 2 - not possible as Tiao works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2 - not possible as Tiao works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3 - not possible as either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1 - possible as Tiao can work in Zone 1 and more sales representatives can work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3 - not possible as Udall works in Zone 2.
  
  Answer: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The company has 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - The sales representatives work in 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  
Analysis:
  - A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2, because there are only 3 sales representatives in Zone 2 or fewer, and more than 3 sales representatives in Zone 1 or more.
  - B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 2, because there are only 3 sales representatives in Zone 2 or fewer, and more than 3 sales representatives in Zone 1 or more.
  - C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3, because Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - D: Tiao can work in Zone 1, because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  - E: Udall cannot work in Zone 3, because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are exactly 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 must have either 4 or 5 sales representatives, and Zone 3 must have either 2 or 3 sales representatives.
  - From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. This means that the remaining sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey) must work in Zone 3.
  - Let's analyze each choice:
    - Choice A: Kim works in Zone 2. This is not possible since all the remaining sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey) must work in Zone 3.
    - Choice B: Mahr works in Zone 2. This is not possible since all the remaining sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey) must work in Zone 3.
    - Choice C: Parra works in Zone 3. This is not possible since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
    - Choice D: Tiao works in Zone 1. This is possible since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and we know that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
    - Choice E: Udall works in Zone 3. This is possible since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and we know that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  6. More sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.

Action: 
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then:
  - Mahr cannot work in Zone 2 because there are only seven sales representatives, and if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then at most two sales representatives can work in Zone 2. Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Tiao cannot both work in Zone 1. Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Parra must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  - Quinn and Stuckey must work in Zone 1 or Zone 3 because there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 2. If Quinn and Stuckey work in Zone 1, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts condition 5. Therefore, Quinn and Stuckey work in Zone 3, and there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 1. If Parra works in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 2, which contradicts condition 2. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 2.
  - If Parra works in Zone 2, then Udall works in Zone 1 with Kim, Mahr, and Quinn/Stuckey. Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 3. 
  - If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3 with Quinn/Stuckey, and Udall works in Zone 2 with Kim and Mahr. Therefore, Udall can work in Zone 3.

  Since Udall can work in Zone 3, the answer is E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 has at least 3 sales representatives and Zone 3 has at most 2 sales representatives.

Analysis:
  - A cannot be true because if Kim works in Zone 2, then neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 2, which violates the condition that Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - B cannot be true because if Mahr works in Zone 2, then neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 2, which violates the condition that Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - C cannot be true because if Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must work in Zone 3 as well, which means that there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - D can be true. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, which means that there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, and Zone 1 has at least 3 sales representatives, which satisfies the given condition.
  - E cannot be true because if Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well, which means that there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day.
  Theresa cannot test G on the second day because if she does, then Reynaldo must test H, which is not possible.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki must test F on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test H on the first day, and Reynaldo must test G on the second day.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  - There are four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider will test one of the bicycles on the first day and a different one on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  
Solution:
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day. So, Yuki must test F on the first day.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. So, Seamus must test F on the second day.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H. So, Theresa must test H on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F. So, Reynaldo must test G on the first day and J on the second day.
  - Therefore, the following could be true:
    - Reynaldo tests G on the second day. (Choice A)
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - Yuki tests the bicycle that Seamus tests on the second day.
  
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then H must be tested by one of the two remaining riders, Reynaldo or Seamus, on the first day. If Reynaldo tests H on the first day, then Seamus must test G on the first day. Then, Yuki must test F on the first day and G on the second day. This means that Seamus cannot test J on the second day, so D is false. If Seamus tests H on the first day, then Reynaldo must test G on the first day. Yuki must test F on the first day and G on the second day. This means that Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day, so A is false. If Yuki tests H on the second day, then Seamus must test J on the second day, which violates the constraint that Yuki tests the bicycle that Seamus tests on the second day. Therefore, C is false. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then G must be tested by the remaining rider, Reynaldo or Seamus, on the second day. This means that E could be true. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the first day.
  Also, Yuki cannot test H on the second day because H must be tested by Theresa.
  
Analysis:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the first day. Therefore, Seamus must test either F, G, or H on the first day. 
  Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the first day. But Yuki cannot test H on the second day because H must be tested by Theresa. Therefore, Yuki must test either F or G on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test either G, H, or J on the first day. Then Reynaldo must test the remaining bicycle on the second day. 
  Theresa must test H on the first day, so Theresa cannot test F, G, or J on the first day. Therefore, Theresa must test either G or F on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
  Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. Yuki tests a bicycle on day one that Seamus tests on day two.
  5. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.

Using these conditions, we can construct a table to keep track of who tests which bicycle on which day.

|         | Day 1 | Day 2 |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Reynaldo|       |       |
| Seamus  |       |       |
| Theresa |   J   |       |
| Yuki    |       |       |

If Theresa tests J on the first day, then we can fill in the table as follows:

|         | Day 1 | Day 2 |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Reynaldo|   G   |   F   |
| Seamus  |   H   |   J   |
| Theresa |   J   |   G   |
| Yuki    |   F   |   H   |

Now we can check which of the options could be true:
A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. True. Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
B: Seamus tests H on the first day. False. Seamus tests J on the first day.
C: Yuki tests H on the second day. False. Yuki tests F on the second day.
D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. True. Seamus tests J on the first day.
E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. True. Theresa tests G on the second day.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will each test one of four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) on the first day.
- Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
- Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
- Reynaldo cannot test F.
- Yuki cannot test J.
- Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
- The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Action: 
If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day and must test it on the second day. Therefore, Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day. According to the conditions, Theresa must test H on the first day and cannot test J. This means that Reynaldo and Seamus must test F and G on the first day, but we do not know which one of them tests which bicycle. On the second day, Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test H. Seamus must test J, and Yuki must test G. Therefore, the only choice that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day. Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then F and H cannot be tested on the first day.
Action: 
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then F and H cannot be tested on the first day. Therefore, Seamus and Yuki must test F and H on the first day, respectively. 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  - Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Seamus must test J on the first day and Yuki must test J on the second day.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Theresa must test H on the second day and cannot test G.
  - Therefore, the only possible option is that Seamus is one of the testers for J. 
  Answer: Choice D, Seamus is one of the testers for J.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests J on the first day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. We know that Reynaldo cannot test F, but we don't know which bicycle he can test on the second day. This choice is possible.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day. Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Seamus cannot test H on the first day. This choice is not possible.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. We don't know which bicycle Yuki tests on the first day, but we know that the bicycle she tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Since Yuki cannot test J, she must test either F, G, or H. If Yuki tests H on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day, which is not possible because Yuki cannot test J. This choice is not possible.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. We know that the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Since Yuki cannot test J, she must test either F, G, or H. If Yuki tests H on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day, which satisfies this choice. This choice is possible.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. We know that Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so she cannot test G on the first day. This choice is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  - There are four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider tests one bicycle each day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day on the second day.
  - Theresa cannot test H on the first day because she is testing J.
  - Therefore, Theresa must test either F or G on the first day.
  - If Theresa tests F on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test F on the second day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test G on the second day, which means that Seamus cannot test G on the second day. This eliminates choices A, B, and D.
  - If Theresa tests G on the first day, then Yuki cannot test G on the second day. Therefore, Yuki must test H on the second day, which satisfies the condition that Theresa must be one of the testers for H. This means that Seamus will test J on the second day, which satisfies the condition that the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, the answer is C.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

If Theresa tests J on the first day, then:
- Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day, which is not J. So, Seamus tests either F, G, or H on the first day.
- Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test either G, H, or J on the first day.
- Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so she must test either F, G, or H.
- Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so she must test either F or G on the second day.

A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. It is possible, as Reynaldo can test either G, H, or J on the first day.
B: Seamus tests H on the first day. It is possible, as Seamus can test either F, G, or H on the first day.
C: Yuki tests H on the second day. It is possible, as Theresa must test either F or G on the second day.
D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. This is not possible, as the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Since Yuki cannot test J, Seamus cannot test J either.
E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. It is possible, as Theresa must test either F or G on the second day.

Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly six out of eight students will give individual oral reports.
  - Reports will be given during three consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
Solution:
  - We know that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, so they cannot give the morning reports on any of the three days.
  - From the given conditions, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday, as it will force Helen and Irving to give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible as George must give a report on Tuesday.
  - So, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  - Therefore, Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  - Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the only remaining students who can give reports are Robert and Olivia.
  - From the given conditions, we know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - Therefore, Robert and Olivia must give morning reports on Monday and Tuesday, but we don't know which order they will go in.
  - The morning report on Wednesday must be given by George, as Nina is giving a report in the afternoon.

Answer: Answer("D") - Olivia, Robert, and Irving
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 8 students who will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina are all possible candidates to give morning reports, as none of them are restricted by the given conditions. 
  B: Irving and Helen are not possible candidates because they are both required to give reports on the same day if Nina gives a report. Robert is not a possible candidate because he cannot give an afternoon report. 
  C: Olivia cannot give a morning report. 
  D: Robert cannot give an afternoon report. Irving is not a possible candidate because he is required to give a report on the same day as Helen if Nina gives a report. 
  E: George cannot give a morning report on Monday because he can only give a report on Tuesday. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The seminar has 8 students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Exactly 6 students will give individual oral reports during 3 consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Exactly 2 reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("E")  
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, there are only 6 students left who can give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. 
From the given conditions, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday and that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. 
If Nina does not give a report, then there are only 5 students left who can give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Olivia, and Robert. This means that on the first day, Monday, only two students can give reports, and since George cannot give a report on Monday, the morning reports must be given by Helen and Irving. 
On the second day, Tuesday, George will give a report in the morning, and since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, the afternoon reports must be given by Nina and either Olivia or Robert. 
On the third day, Wednesday, only two students are left who can give reports: Olivia and Robert. Therefore, the morning reports on Wednesday must be given by Robert and George, which means that the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Robert, George, and Helen (choice E).
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Of the eight students exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students who can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are:
  - George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert
  
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday and Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, the only possible schedules are:
  Monday: Morning reports by (Nina and Robert) or (Helen and George)
  Tuesday: Morning reports by (George and Irving) or (Helen and Nina)
  Wednesday: Morning reports by (Helen and Robert) or (Irving and Nina)
  
  From the above schedules, we can see that the only option that satisfies the condition is (B) Irving, Robert, and Helen
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
- Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("E")

If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students who will give reports are George, Helen, Nina, Olivia, Robert, and Irving. 

We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday. 
We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they can only give morning reports. 

If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, because if she did, then Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday. This means that Nina must give a report on Wednesday.

So, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
- Monday: Robert and Helen
- Tuesday: George and Irving (George can only give a report on Tuesday)
- Wednesday: Nina and Lenore (Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, and Kyle is not giving a report) 

Therefore, the answer is (E) Robert, George, and Helen.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The seminar has 8 students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Exactly 6 students will give oral reports during three consecutive days.
  Each day, exactly 2 reports will be given, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

To find out which students can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, we can work backwards from the conditions.

If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who give reports must be George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.

If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (Tuesday), Helen and Irving must both give reports. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, so she must give her report on Wednesday.

Therefore, the schedule must look like this:
Monday:
Morning: George and Olivia
Afternoon: Helen and Robert

Tuesday:
Morning: Nina and [one other student]
Afternoon: Helen and Irving

Wednesday:
Morning: [two students who have not given a morning report yet]
Afternoon: Robert and Olivia

George must give his report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday. This means that George is one of the students who must give a morning report on Wednesday.

Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, so they cannot give reports on Monday. This means that Helen and Irving are the two students who must give morning reports on Monday.

Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Irving, Helen, and George.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. The seminar has 8 students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  2. Exactly 6 students will give oral reports during 3 consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  3. Exactly 2 reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  4. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  5. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  6. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then we have only 6 students left to give reports. Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, we know that he will give one of the reports on Tuesday. Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they both must give morning reports on Monday and Wednesday. 
  
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. However, Kyle and Lenore cannot give reports, so that means we cannot have Nina give a report. So, we have the following scenario:
  
  Monday morning: Olivia and Robert
  Monday afternoon: 
  Tuesday morning: George
  Tuesday afternoon: 
  Wednesday morning: Helen and Irving
  Wednesday afternoon: Olivia and Robert
  
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Answer("B") Irving, Robert, and Helen.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a combination of three people who can give a report in the morning on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Solution:
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we are left with six people (excluding George, who can only present on Tuesday): Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Let's start with Monday morning:
  Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the only people left are Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since Nina cannot present on Monday morning, we are left with four people.
  Since Robert cannot present on Monday morning, we are left with three people: Helen, Irving, and Olivia.
  Now, let's move to Tuesday morning:
  George has to present on Tuesday, so we are left with five people: Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since Helen and Irving have to present on the day after Nina, and Nina cannot present on Tuesday, we are left with three people: Olivia, Helen, and Robert.
  Finally, let's move to Wednesday morning:
  We are left with three people: Helen, Irving, and Nina.
  Since Nina can only present on Wednesday if she hasn't presented on Tuesday, we are left with two people: Helen and Irving.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Irving, Robert, and Olivia.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The only day George can give a report is Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Kyle and Lenore will not give reports.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left who can give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday. 
  Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they can only give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday. 
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Wednesday. 
  Therefore, the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, are:
  - Monday: Nina and Helen
  - Tuesday: George and Irving
  - Wednesday: Olivia and Robert

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
 
Action: Answer("D")

If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the only remaining students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are George, Helen, Nina, Irving, Olivia, and Robert. 

We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, they must give morning reports on Monday and Wednesday, respectively. 

If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. So, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, otherwise Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday, which would exceed the limit of two reports per day. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.

This leaves us with three students who can potentially give a report on Monday morning: Helen, Irving, and Robert. Since Robert is already assigned to give a morning report on Wednesday, he cannot give another one on Monday, so the morning reports on Monday must be given by Helen and Irving. 

Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Irving and Helen, George and Nina, and Robert and Olivia. Thus, the answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving.

At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  If I is on the middle shelf, then we know that F and M cannot be on the same shelf as I.
  If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  If F is on the same shelf as M, then F and M cannot be on the top shelf.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then F cannot be on the same shelf as I or M. Therefore, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, then we do not have enough information to determine where any of the other books are placed. Therefore, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then M cannot be on the same shelf as F. Therefore, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then F cannot be on the same shelf as M. Therefore, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then we do not have enough information to determine where any of the other books are placed. Therefore, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The books are divided into three shelves.
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  If I is on the middle shelf, then the remaining books are divided into the top and bottom shelves. Since we know that the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf, we know that either 5 or 6 books are on the bottom shelf. 
  Since K is on a higher shelf than F, we know that F is on either the top or middle shelf. If F is on the top shelf, then K is on the middle or bottom shelf. If F is on the middle shelf, then K and L are on the bottom shelf. Therefore, F must be on the middle shelf and K must be on the bottom shelf.
  Since O is on a higher shelf than L, we know that O must be on the top shelf.
  Since F is on the same shelf as M, we know that M must be on the middle shelf and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, we have fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - If I is on the middle shelf, then the other two shelves must have at least 2 books each.
  - If K is on a higher shelf than F and the top shelf has fewer books than the bottom, then K and F must be on the middle and top shelves, but it's not clear which one is on which.
  - If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top or middle shelf, and L must be on the bottom or middle shelf, but it's not clear which one is on which.
  - If F is on the same shelf as M, then they must be on the top or middle shelf, but it's not clear which one is on which.

Solution:
  - If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, then we know that they are both on the middle or bottom shelf, but we still don't know which one is on which. However, we can use the other clues to determine the placement of the other books.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  There are eight books, and at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  
Analysis:
  If I is on the middle shelf, then there are at most three books on the middle shelf. If F is on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be on the top or middle shelf, since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the top shelf. If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If H and O are on the same shelf, then they must be on the middle or bottom shelf, since K is on a higher shelf than F.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is on the middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where any of the other books are placed, so this is not enough information to determine which shelf each book is on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where any of the other books are placed, so this is not enough information to determine which shelf each book is on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we already know that F is on the same shelf as M, so we can determine that L, F, and M are all on the same shelf. However, we don't know where any of the other books are placed, so this is not enough information to determine which shelf each book is on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we already know that F is on the same shelf as M, so we can determine that F, M, and H are all on the same shelf. However, we don't know where any of the other books are placed, so this is not enough information to determine which shelf each book is on.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that O is on a higher shelf than L and that there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can determine that H and O are on the top shelf and that L is on the middle shelf. We also know that I is on the middle shelf, so the remaining books (F, G, and K) must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, it is fully determined which shelf each of the books is placed on if H and O are placed on the same shelf.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  We know that there are 8 books and 3 shelves. 
  At least 2 books are placed on each shelf. 
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf. 
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F. 
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L. 
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where the other books are placed. 
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where the other books are placed.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be on the top shelf, so O must be on the middle shelf, and K and I must be on the bottom shelf. This satisfies all of the given conditions.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where the other books are placed.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that L must be on the top shelf, so K and I must be on the bottom shelf, and F and M must be on the middle shelf. However, this arrangement does not satisfy the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - If I is placed on the middle shelf, then M cannot be on the top shelf since F is on the same shelf as M.
  - If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - If F is on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be on the top or middle shelf since K cannot be on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation:
  - If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, then F and M must be on the top or middle shelf since K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, the location of all the books on the shelves can be fully determined.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf that is. So, it does not fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf that is. So, it does not fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf that is. So, it does not fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf that is. So, it does not fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf that is. So, it does not fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf must have at least 2 books.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If I is placed on the middle shelf, we have only two choices for the shelves where F and M can be placed: top and bottom. If F is on the top shelf, then M must be on the bottom shelf, and vice versa. But we cannot determine where the other books are placed based on this information alone.
  - If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine where any of the other books are placed, except that K is not on the bottom shelf, and G is not on the top shelf.
  - If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then M must also be on that shelf. Since we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, this means that L, F, and M must all be on the bottom shelf, and the remaining 5 books must be on the top and middle shelves. We can also determine that K is not on the middle shelf, and O is not on the top shelf, but we cannot determine the exact placement of any of the other books.
  - If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we can use the fact that F is on the same shelf as M to determine that F, M, and H are all on the same shelf. Since we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, this means that L and O must also be on the bottom shelf, and the remaining 3 books must be on the top and middle shelves. We can also determine that K is not on the middle shelf, but we cannot determine the exact placement of any of the other books.
  - If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine where any of the other books are placed, except that O is not on the top shelf, and H is not on the bottom shelf.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves.
  More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  If I is on the middle shelf, then the top shelf must have at least 2 books and the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books. 
  If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  If F is on the same shelf as M, then F and M must both be on the middle shelf or both be on the bottom shelf.
  None of the choices provides enough information to determine which shelf each book is placed on.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. Yuki tests a bike on day 1 that Seamus tests on day 2.
  5. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then the following must be true:
  - Theresa cannot test G on the first day.
  - Theresa must test H on the first day.
  - Yuki cannot test H on the first day.
  - Yuki must test J on the first day.
  - Seamus must test H on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test G on the first day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. False.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. True.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. False.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. False.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. False.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Reynaldo cannot test F.
- Yuki cannot test J.
- Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
- The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
- Each rider will test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then we know that she must test H on the first day, since she must be one of the testers for H. Then, we can use the condition that the bicycle Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day to determine the assignments:
- On the first day, Reynaldo must test J (since he cannot test F, and Yuki cannot test J).
- On the first day, Yuki must test F (since she cannot test J, and Reynaldo cannot test F).
- On the first day, Seamus must test G (since Theresa is testing H, and Yuki is testing F).
- On the second day, Reynaldo must test H (since he has not tested H yet, and he cannot test F or J).
- On the second day, Yuki must test J (since she has not tested J yet, and she cannot test F).
- On the second day, Seamus must test F (since he must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day).

Therefore, the answer is D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then either Seamus or Reynaldo must test F on the second day.
  
Solution:
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then either Seamus or Reynaldo must test F on the second day. This is because each bicycle is tested each day.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, the remaining rider who did not test F on the second day must test H on the second day.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, Seamus cannot test F on the first day and must test J on the first day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F. Therefore, Reynaldo must test H on the first day.
  - This means that Theresa tests J on the first day.
  - Therefore, the correct answer is D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then H must be her bicycle on the first day.
  - Therefore, Yuki must test J on the first day, and Seamus must test F on the first day.
  - Reynaldo's bicycle on the first day must be G or J.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
  Possible scenarios:
  1. Reynaldo tests H on the first day. Then, Yuki must test J on the first day and Seamus must test F on the first day. On the second day, Seamus tests H, Reynaldo tests G, and Yuki tests F.
  2. Reynaldo tests J on the first day. Then, Yuki must test F on the first day and Seamus must test H on the first day. On the second day, Seamus tests J, Reynaldo tests G, and Yuki tests H.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. (Possible scenario)
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. (Possible scenario)
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. (Given)
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. (Not possible, because Yuki cannot test J)
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. (Not possible, because Theresa must be one of the testers for H)
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  - Four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider tests one bicycle on the first day and a different one on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H on one of the days.
  - Yuki tests a bicycle on the first day that Seamus tests on the second day.
  
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Reynaldo cannot test G on the first day because each bicycle is tested by a different rider each day.
  - If Reynaldo cannot test F on the first day, and Theresa must test H on one of the days, then Reynaldo must test either H or J on the first day. 
  - If Yuki cannot test J on the first day, and Yuki tests a bicycle on the first day that Seamus tests on the second day, then Yuki must be testing either F or H on the first day.
  
Analysis:
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test G on the first day.
  - Reynaldo must test either H or J on the first day.
  - Yuki tests a bicycle on the first day that Seamus tests on the second day, and Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Yuki must be testing H on the first day.
  - Therefore, on the first day, Reynaldo tests J, Yuki tests H, Seamus tests F, and Theresa tests G.
  - On the second day, Reynaldo tests H, Yuki tests J, Seamus tests G, and Theresa tests F.
  
Action: Answer("D")  Theresa tests J on the first day.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must test H.
  4. Yuki tests a bike on day 1 that Seamus tests on day 2.
  5. Each rider tests only one bike per day, and all four bikes are tested each day.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then:
- Theresa cannot test G on the first day.
- Yuki cannot test G on the first day (because Yuki cannot test J, and if Yuki tested G on day 1, then Seamus would have to test J on day 2, which is not allowed).
- Seamus must test G on the first day (because Seamus tests the bike that Yuki tests on day 1, and Yuki cannot test G on day 1).
- Reynaldo cannot test J on the first day (because if Reynaldo tested J on day 1, then Seamus would have to test Yuki's bike on day 2, which is not allowed).
- Reynaldo cannot test H on the first day (because then Theresa would have to test F on the first day, which is not allowed).
- Therefore, Reynaldo must test bike F on the first day.

Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. - False, Reynaldo tests F on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. - False, Reynaldo cannot test J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. - True, Theresa must test H at some point, and if she tests G on the second day, then she must test H on the first day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. - False, Theresa must test H.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. - False, Yuki cannot test J, and Seamus tests G on the first day. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Four riders Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki will test four bicycles F, G, H, and J over two days.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Solution:
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then on the first day, either Reynaldo or Seamus must test G since each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. 
  But Reynaldo cannot test F. So Reynaldo must test J on the first day. 
  Yuki cannot test J. So Yuki must test F on the first day. 
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. So Seamus must test G on the second day. 
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H. So Theresa must test H on the first day. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day.
  - Therefore, she must test H on the first day.
  - Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test F on the first day.
  - Seamus must test J on the second day.
  - Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  - Therefore, Reynaldo tests J on the second day.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider will test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then H must be the bicycle that she tests on the first day. Therefore, Yuki cannot test H on the second day because Yuki cannot test J. Thus, Yuki must test J on the second day, which means Seamus must test J on the first day. This leaves Reynaldo to test F on the first day.

Action: Answer("B") - Reynaldo tests J on the first day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  G, H, and J are finance articles.
  Q, R, and S are nutrition articles.
  Y is a wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, the first three articles must be nutrition articles, but it is impossible to determine which nutrition articles they are. The remaining order of the finance articles and the wildlife article would still be undetermined. Therefore, this choice is not sufficient to fully determine the order in which the articles are edited.

B: If H is sixth, the first three articles must be nutrition articles, and the fourth and fifth articles must be finance articles. The remaining article must be the wildlife article. Therefore, this choice is sufficient to fully determine the order in which the articles are edited.

C: If R is fourth, the first three articles must be nutrition articles, and the fourth article must be a finance article. However, it is impossible to determine which finance article it is. The remaining order of the articles would still be undetermined. Therefore, this choice is not sufficient to fully determine the order in which the articles are edited.

D: If R is seventh, the first three articles must be nutrition articles, and the fourth and fifth articles must be finance articles. However, it is impossible to determine which finance article is fourth and which is fifth. The remaining article must be the wildlife article. Therefore, this choice is not sufficient to fully determine the order in which the articles are edited.

E: If Y is fifth, the first four articles must be either nutrition or finance articles. However, it is impossible to determine which articles they are, because we do not know the order of the finance and nutrition articles. Therefore, this choice is not sufficient to fully determine the order in which the articles are edited.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The articles can be grouped into three categories: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

We can use the process of elimination to determine the answer.
Option A: If H is fourth, we don't know the order of the other articles. Eliminate A.
Option B: If H is sixth, we don't know the order of the other articles. Eliminate B.
Option C: If R is fourth, the order of the articles is as follows: S, Q, R, G, J, H, Y. This satisfies all of the given conditions. Therefore, C is the answer.
Option D: If R is seventh, we don't know the order of the other articles. Eliminate D.
Option E: If Y is fifth, we don't know the order of the other articles. Eliminate E.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three of the articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three of the articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  The remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
  We will use the answer choices to determine which one gives us enough information to fully determine the order in which the articles are edited.

Solution:
  A: If H is fourth, we don't know anything about the order of the other articles, so this choice is not enough information to fully determine the order.
  B: If H is sixth, then we know that the three finance articles (G, H, and J) must be edited in positions 1, 2, and 3, but we don't know the order of the nutrition articles or the wildlife article. This choice is not enough information to fully determine the order.
  C: If R is fourth, then we know that the three finance articles must be edited in positions 2, 3, and 5. We also know that the wildlife article must be edited last. The only remaining article that could be edited in position 1 is Q, since S cannot be earlier than Q if Q is not third. Therefore, the order must be: Q R G J S H Y. This choice is enough information to fully determine the order.
  D: If R is seventh, we don't know anything about the order of the other articles, so this choice is not enough information to fully determine the order.
  E: If Y is fifth, we know that S must be edited before Y, but we don't know anything about the order of the other articles. This choice is not enough information to fully determine the order.

Therefore, the answer is Choice C: R is fourth.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are 3 finance articles, 3 nutrition articles, and 1 wildlife article. 
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
A: If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles. Q cannot be first because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, S must be second, and R must be third. Then, G must be fifth, J must be sixth, and Y must be seventh. However, we do not know the order in which the two remaining finance articles, G and J, are edited. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
B: If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be nutrition articles, and S must be earlier than Q. Therefore, Q must be third, and R must be fourth. Then, the remaining three articles must be edited in the order G, J, and Y. However, we do not know the order in which G and J are edited. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
C: If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles, and S must be earlier than Q. Therefore, Q must be second, and R must be third. Then, the remaining four articles must be edited in the order G, J, H, and Y. However, we do not know the order in which G, J, and H are edited. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
D: If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles. S cannot be first because S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, Q must be first, and S must be second. Then, the remaining five articles must be edited in the order G, J, R, H, and Y. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
E: If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be finance and nutrition articles. However, S must be earlier than Y, so Y cannot be fifth. Therefore, this option cannot be correct.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Articles G, H, and J cover finance.
  Articles Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  Article Y covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, we do not know which topic the first three articles belong to or the order of S, Y, and R.
B: If H is sixth, we do not know the topic of the fifth article or the order of S, Y, and R.
C: If R is fourth, we know that the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, in that order. Then, the next article must be either G or J, depending on which comes first. Then, the remaining two articles must be H and either G or J, depending on which one was not chosen before.
D: If R is seventh, we do not know the topic of the sixth article or the order of S, Y, and G.
E: If Y is fifth, we do not know the topic of the first four articles or the order of S, G, and R.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
- Three finance articles are G, H, and J.
- Three nutrition articles are Q, R, and S.
- One article is about wildlife and it is Y.
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
- S must be earlier than Y.
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, then the articles edited before H must be G, S, and Y. This means that the remaining articles to edit are J, Q, R, and the order is not fully determined yet because we do not know which article should be edited next.
B: If H is sixth, then the articles edited before H must be G, S, Y, Q, and R. This means that only J and the wildlife article Y need to be edited, and J must be edited before Y. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
C: If R is fourth, then the articles edited before R must be S, Y, and Q. This means that the remaining articles to edit are G, J, H, and the order is not fully determined yet because we do not know which article should be edited next.
D: If R is seventh, then the articles edited before R must be G, J, S, Y, Q, H, and the order is fully determined.
E: If Y is fifth, then the articles edited before Y must be S and Q. This means that the remaining articles to edit are G, J, R, H, and the order is not fully determined yet because we do not know which article should be edited next.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 articles to be edited.
  3 articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  3 articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  1 article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then G must be edited third and J must be edited second. This means that R must be edited fifth, but the order of the remaining articles is not determined. So, A is not correct.
  If H is sixth, then S must be edited fifth and Q must be edited third. This means that Y must be edited seventh, and the order of the remaining articles is not determined. So, B is not correct.
  If R is fourth, then S must be edited third and Q must be edited second. This means that Y must be edited seventh, and the order of the remaining articles is not determined. So, C is not correct.
  If R is seventh, then Y must be edited sixth, S must be edited fifth, Q must be edited fourth, and the order of the remaining articles is not determined. So, D is not correct.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be edited fourth and Q must be edited third. This means that G must be edited second and J must be edited first. Then, H and R can only be edited sixth and seventh, respectively. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if Y is fifth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  - Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  - One article covers wildlife: Y.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

For the order to be fully determined, we need to know the exact position of all seven articles. Let's consider each choice:

A: If H is fourth, we don't know the position of any of the other articles, so the order is not fully determined.

B: If H is sixth, then we know that G, J, Q, R, and S must come before H. We still don't know the position of Y, so the order is not fully determined.

C: If R is fourth, then we know that Q and S must come before R. Since S must be earlier than Y, we know the order of S, Q, and R. We also know that G must come before R, so the order of G, J, and H is determined. The only remaining article is Y, so the order is fully determined.

D: If R is seventh, then we know that Q and S must come before R. Since S must be earlier than Y, we know the order of S, Q, and R. We also know that G must come before R, so the order of G, J, and H is determined. However, we don't know the position of Y, so the order is not fully determined.

E: If Y is fifth, then we know that S must be earlier than Y. However, we don't know the position of any of the other articles, so the order is not fully determined.

Therefore, the answer is C: R is fourth.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions:
    - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
    - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
    - S must be earlier than Y.
    - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, then the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined, because we still do not know the order of the first three articles, which must be one nutrition article, one finance article, and one of Y.
B: If H is sixth, then the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined. The order must be: Q, R, S, Y, G, J, H.
C: If R is fourth, then the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined, because we still do not know the order of the first three articles, which must be one nutrition article, one finance article, and one of Y.
D: If R is seventh, then the order in which the articles are fully determined. The order must be: Q, S, Y, R, G, J, H.
E: If Y is fifth, then the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined, because we still do not know the order of the first four articles, which must be one nutrition article, one finance article, one of Q or S, and one of G or J.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles to be edited, covering three topics: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Option analysis:
  A: If H is fourth, then there are two possible orders for the nutrition articles: QRS or RSQ. If we assume QRS, then the order of the finance articles must be JGH, and the order of the remaining articles must be Y. However, this violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. If we assume RSQ, then the order of the finance articles must be JHG, and the order of the remaining articles must be Y. This satisfies all of the conditions. Therefore, this option is not fully determined.
  B: If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be QRSYJ. This means that the order of the finance articles must be GHJ, and the order of the nutrition articles must be QR. This satisfies all of the conditions. Therefore, this option is fully determined.
  C: If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be QRS. The order of the finance articles must be JGH, and the order of the remaining articles must be Y. However, this violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, this option is not fully determined.
  D: If R is seventh, then the first six articles must be QRSYJG. This means that the order of the finance articles must be HJG, and the order of the nutrition articles must be QR. This satisfies all of the conditions. Therefore, this option is fully determined.
  E: If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be QRSG. The order of the finance articles must be HJG, and the order of the remaining articles must be Y. However, this violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, this option is not fully determined.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The total number of books is 8
  - There are three shelves: top, middle, and bottom
  - Each shelf has at least two books
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf
  - I is placed on the middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M
  - If G is on the top shelf, then it means that at most one book is on the top shelf.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that I is on the middle shelf, so it must be there.
  - We know that F is on the same shelf as M, so if F were on the middle shelf, M would have to be there too, but we don't have enough space for three books on the middle shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf.
  - We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top or middle shelf. If G is on the top shelf, then K must be on the middle shelf.
  - We know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top or middle shelf. If G is on the top shelf, then O must be on the middle shelf.
  - We are left with the books H and L. At least two books are on each shelf. If G is on the top shelf, then H and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Eight books are placed on a bookcase with three shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, we need to find a list of books that can be placed on the middle shelf while satisfying all the conditions.

Analysis:
  Since G is placed on the top shelf, we know that at least two books are placed on each shelf, and more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, we can infer that only one book is placed on the top shelf, and this book is either H or I. 
  Since I is placed on the middle shelf, H must be placed on the top shelf.
  Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be placed on the top or middle shelf, and F must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf. But since F is placed on the same shelf as M, F must be placed on the middle shelf and M must be placed on the same shelf as F, i.e., the middle shelf.
  Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be placed on the top shelf, and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf. But since I is already placed on the middle shelf, L must be placed on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is I and L, and the correct answer is (B) I, L.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at most 2 books on the top shelf. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, there are exactly 3 books on the middle shelf, and one of them is I.
  
  A: H and I cannot both be placed on the middle shelf because there must be exactly 3 books on the middle shelf.
  B: If I is on the middle shelf, then O must be on the bottom shelf (because O is on a higher shelf than L). This means that there are at least 4 books on the bottom shelf, which contradicts the condition that there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  C: H and L can both be placed on the middle shelf with I, and this satisfies all the conditions.
  D: K cannot be on the middle shelf because it is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  E: If F, I, and M are on the same shelf, then they must be on the middle shelf. However, this would mean that there are only 2 books on the top shelf, which contradicts the condition that there are at least 2 books on each shelf.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.

  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
If G is placed on the top shelf, then:
  - The bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - The middle shelf must have at least 2 books.
  - G is not placed on the middle or the bottom shelf.

The only book that is confirmed to be on the middle shelf is I. The other book(s) on the middle shelf must be higher than G and lower than I. 

Checking the answer choices:
  A: H, I - This is possible since H can be on the same shelf as G, and I must be on the middle shelf.
  B: I, L - This is not possible since L must be on the bottom shelf.
  C: H, I, L - This is not possible since L must be on the bottom shelf.
  D: I, K, L - This is not possible since K must be on a higher shelf than F, and G is on the top shelf.
  E: F, I, M - This is not possible since F and M must be on the same shelf, and G is on the top shelf.

Action: Answer("A") - H, I
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly 8 books.
  - There are exactly 3 shelves.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

If G is placed on the top shelf:
  - The bottom shelf must have more books than the top shelf, so at most 2 books are on the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf, so the top shelf cannot have I.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the top shelf.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the top shelf.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F cannot be on the top shelf.
  - That leaves only G and H for the top shelf.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The total number of books is 8, and they are placed on three shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are 2 books on the top shelf.
  The number of books on the middle shelf is either 2, 3, or 4.
  
Analysis: 
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are 2 books on the top shelf. 
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M cannot be on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the top shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the top shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the top shelf.
  That leaves only G and H for the top shelf.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf. 
  That leaves only L and M for the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the middle shelf must contain F, I, and K.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:

  - There are three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at least two books on the top shelf, and since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be at most two books on the top shelf. Therefore, the only possible book on the top shelf is G. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, and K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K and F must be placed on the top and middle shelves, respectively. Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, then M must be placed on the middle shelf. Finally, since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O and L must be placed on the bottom and middle shelves, respectively.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are 2 books left to place on the middle shelf. One of them is I, which we know must be placed on the middle shelf. The other one must be either H, K, L, or O. We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf. We also know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so if O is on the middle shelf, then L must be on the bottom shelf, which would violate the condition that the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf. Therefore, O cannot be on the middle shelf. That leaves us with H and L as the only possible books to be on the middle shelf with I.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are exactly 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf contains at least 3 books, and the middle shelf contains at least 2 books. 
  
  We know that I is on the middle shelf, so the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf must include I. 
  
  We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be either on the top shelf or on the middle shelf. But if K is on the middle shelf, then F and M must also be on the middle shelf, which would mean that there are already at least 3 books on the middle shelf, and we know that there must be at least 2 books on the middle shelf. Therefore, K must be on the top shelf. 
  
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf. 
  
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is: I, L.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We know that there are eight books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  We know that there are exactly three shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  We know that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  We know that more books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then we know that at least two books are on the top shelf. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf, we can deduce that there are at most two books on the top shelf. 
  We also know that I is placed on the middle shelf, and that F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, if G is on the top shelf, then K, L, and O must be on the bottom shelf. 
  This leaves us with only two books, H and I, to place on the middle shelf.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

Action: 
If the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, then it cannot be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, because the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the table can only be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. 

If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. However, the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, and it cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd and June 3rd in some order. This means that the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp, since the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. Therefore, A is not true.

If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. However, the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, and it cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 3rd, and the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd in some order. This means that the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp, since the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, B is not true.

If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. However, the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, and it cannot be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 4th or earlier, and the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd in some order. This means that the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp, since the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. Therefore, E is not true.

If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp, since the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp cannot be auctioned before the mirror and the vase. This means that the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd and June 3rd in some order. Therefore, the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, and D is true.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 2nd through June 4th.
  - The table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  - The harmonica and the lamp can be auctioned on any of the six days.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Since the table is auctioned on a later date than the vase and the mirror, it must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. Therefore, it is possible for the table to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, which means that option B is a possible scenario. Option A is not possible because the table must be auctioned on a later date than the harmonica. Option C is not possible because the table must be auctioned on a later date than the sundial. Option D is not possible because the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Option E is not relevant to the question.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned later than both the mirror and the vase.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. 
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.

Analysis: 
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date later than the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 5th or 6th. 
  From the rule that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both, we can eliminate option A because if the harmonica is auctioned before the table, then the table must be auctioned on June 6th, which contradicts the given condition.
  Option B is not necessarily true since we do not know the order of the table and the lamp.
  From the rule that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, we know that the sundial and the vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, option C cannot be true.
  From the rule that if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, we cannot have the mirror and the vase being auctioned on the same day. Therefore, option D cannot be true.
  Option E is not necessarily true since we do not know the order of the sundial and the lamp.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  3. The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  4. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. From condition 2, we know that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. However, we don't know the order of the harmonica and the lamp. From condition 3, we know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. From condition 4, we know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that the mirror is auctioned before the vase, which means that D is the correct answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  3. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  4. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  5. If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
From condition 5, we know that the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase. From condition 3, we know that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on the same day as the table. From condition 1, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which means that the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table (condition 4). Therefore, A is false. From condition 2, we know that if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on a later date than the lamp, which means that B is false. From condition 1, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, C is false. From condition 3, we know that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase. Therefore, D could be true. From condition 2, we know that if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on a later date than the table, which means that E is false. Hence, the answer is D.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  3. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  4. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  5. The table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  
  A: It is possible that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table since the table can be auctioned on June 6th, which is the last day of the auction, while the harmonica can be auctioned on June 1st, the first day of the auction. Therefore, A could be true.
  B: Since the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, it is not possible for the table to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: Since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and the table cannot be auctioned on the same day as the harmonica, C is not true.
  D: Since the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, it is possible that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: Since the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, it is not possible for the sundial to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, E is not true.
Action: Answer("AD")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, we know that the table will be auctioned no earlier than the 4th day of the week.
  - The harmonica cannot be auctioned on the 6th day of the week because the table must be auctioned no later than the 5th day of the week.
  - Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on either the 2nd or 3rd day of the week.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on the 2nd day of the week, then the mirror must also be auctioned on the 2nd day, which contradicts the fact that the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror.
  - Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on the 3rd day of the week, and the mirror must be auctioned on the 2nd day of the week.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase if it is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - There are six consecutive days of auctions from June 1st to June 6th.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the following must be true:
    * The table is not auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd since the vase and the mirror cannot be auctioned later than the table.
    * The harmonica cannot be auctioned on a later date than the table since the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
    * The lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table since the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - Thus, the only possible true statement is that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
- We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. This means that if the table is auctioned after the mirror, then it is also auctioned after the lamp.
- Therefore, it is possible that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.

  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  There are seven spaces and seven businesses.
Analysis: 
  Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be either in space 1 or space 7. Because one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, that restaurant must be in space 1 or space 7. Therefore, the two restaurants are separated by three spaces. Thus, the optometrist must be in space 2 or space 6, and the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. Consequently, the pharmacy is in space 7, the restaurant is in space 1, and the optometrist is in space 2. Therefore, the shoe store cannot be in space 6 because it would be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the toy store must be in space 3.

  Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, it is known that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian or the optometrist.
Analysis:
  Since the veterinarian is in space 5 and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the toy store cannot be in space 4 or 6. Therefore, space 3 and 7 are the only spaces where the toy store can be located. Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, the pharmacy cannot be in space 7. It must be in space 1. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the only possible arrangement is to have the restaurants in spaces 3 and 7. Therefore, a restaurant is in space 4. Since the pharmacy is in space 1 and the optometrist or veterinarian must be next to the pharmacy, the optometrist must be in space 2. Hence, the shoe store must be in space 6.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The veterinarian is in space 5.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy can be in space 4 or space 6. Also, one of the restaurants must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the other restaurant must be in either space 1 or space 7. If the pharmacy is in space 4, then the restaurant must be in space 7, and if the pharmacy is in space 6, then the restaurant must be in space 1. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, there must be at least one business between the restaurant and the pharmacy. Therefore, the restaurant cannot be in space 4. Also, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 4 or space 6. Therefore, the only option left is that the restaurant is in space 7 and the pharmacy is in space 4. This means that the optometrist is in space 3, the toy store is in space 2, and the shoe store is in space 6.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The veterinarian is in space 5.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 4 or 6. 
  If the pharmacy is in space 4, then the optometrist must be in space 3 and the toy store must be in space 1, which violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. 
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 6. 
  If the pharmacy is in space 6, then one of the restaurants must be in space 1 and the other restaurant must be in space 7. 
  Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, either the optometrist or the shoe store must be in space 3. 
  If the optometrist is in space 3, then the toy store must be in space 1, which violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
  Therefore, the shoe store must be in space 3. 
  This means that the optometrist must be in space 2 and the toy store must be in space 1. 
  Therefore, a restaurant is in space 4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread.
- Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs.
- Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
- The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
- In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
- In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
- Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
- Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
- Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

A: There could be a multicolored rug with forest if we use forest in combination with four other colors, so this statement is not necessarily true.
B: If we use turquoise in a multicolored rug, we cannot use it with forest, peach, or yellow, so it is not possible to use it with two other colors as required by the rules. Therefore, this statement must be true.
C: According to the rules, we know that olive must be used with peach, and white must be used with two other colors. If we use olive, peach, and white in two of the rugs, then we only need to use two other colors in the third rug, and one of them can be peach. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
D: According to the rules, we know that forest and turquoise cannot be used together, and peach and turquoise cannot be used together. Therefore, if we use turquoise, we must use it in a rug with only one of these colors, which means it cannot be used in a solid-colored rug. Therefore, this statement must be true.
E: According to the rules, we know that peach and yellow cannot be used together. Therefore, we cannot use yellow in a rug with peach, and we cannot use peach in a rug with yellow. However, we still have three other rugs in which we can use yellow. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 6 colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  - Exactly 5 colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  - Each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - White must be used with two other colors in any rug.
  - Olive must be used with peach in any rug.
  - Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.

Solution:
  - Using the given rules, we can deduce the following:
    - White must be used in a multicolored rug, and thus two other colors must be used with it.
    - Olive must be used with peach, so they must be used together in a rug.
    - Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, so they must be used in separate rugs.
    - Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, so they must be used in separate rugs.
    - Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so they must be used in separate rugs.
  - So, we know that:
    - There is at least one multicolored rug with white in it.
    - There are three rugs with forest, olive, and turquoise used in them, respectively.
    - This leaves only yellow to be used in the rug with peach.
  - Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("E") - Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread.
  - Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Analysis:
  - A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used. 
    - It is possible to have a solid forest-colored rug and two multicolored rugs without forest.
    - Therefore, option A is not necessarily true.
  - B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used. 
    - This is true because of the rule that Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug and each color is used exactly once.
    - Therefore, option B is true.
  - C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
    - This is true because of the rule that In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used, and each color is used exactly once.
    - Therefore, option C is true.
  - D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
    - This is not necessarily true because of the rule that Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug and each color is used exactly once.
    - Therefore, option D is not necessarily true.
  - E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
    - This is not necessarily true because each color is used exactly once.
    - Therefore, option E is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:

  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  According to the given rules, Peach can only be used in a rug in which Olive is also used, and Olive is used in only one rug. Therefore, Peach must be used in the same rug as Olive. Since each color is used in only one rug, Peach is used in one of the rugs. Hence, the correct answer is C.

  - The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  - According to the given rules, we can deduce the following:
    - Since there are only three rugs and each color can be used in only one rug, at least two colors will be left out.
    - From the given rules, we know that forest and turquoise cannot be used together, and peach cannot be used with turquoise or yellow. Therefore, we can conclude that forest, turquoise, and yellow will not be used together in any of the rugs.
    - If we consider the rule that white must be used with two other colors, then we know that white will be used in a multicolored rug.
    - From the given rule that olive must be used with peach, we know that olive and peach will be used together in a rug. This rug will either be multicolored or a solid color.
  - Using the above deductions, we can eliminate choices A, B, and D, as there is no guarantee that forest, turquoise, or turquoise will not be used in any of the rugs.

  - Constraints:
    - Oil paintings and watercolors lectures must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    - Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.

A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  - This is possible. Farley can give the first lecture on lithographs, and then Holden can give the oil paintings lecture followed by Garcia's sculpture lecture, and finally, Jiang's watercolors lecture.
B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  - This is possible. Garcia can give the sculptures lecture, which can be the third lecture in the series.
C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  - This is possible. Garcia can give the watercolors lecture, which can be the second or fourth lecture in the series.
D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  - This is possible. Holden can give the first lecture on oil paintings, followed by Farley's lithographs lecture, then Garcia's sculpture lecture, and finally, Jiang's watercolors lecture.
E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
  - This is not possible. If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture. But if Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Garcia's lecture must be the last one, and Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's. Therefore, Jiang cannot give the watercolors lecture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The lectures are on four different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives a lecture on a different topic.
  - The lectures are given one at a time.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

A: If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then he must give it last. This is not possible because the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, A cannot be true.

B: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the only lecture left for her is the watercolors lecture, but the watercolors lecture must be given earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, B cannot be true.

C: Garcia can give the watercolors lecture because it can be given before the lithographs lecture, which is the last lecture. Therefore, C can be true.

D: If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then the only lecture left for him is the sculptures lecture, which must be given later than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. This is not possible because Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, D cannot be true.

E: Jiang can give the watercolors lecture because it can be given before the lithographs lecture, which is the last lecture. Therefore, E can be true.

  - If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, which is true according to the given constraints. Therefore, B can be true.
  - If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, which is a contradiction to the given constraints. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  - If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than Holden's lecture, which is a contradiction to the given constraints. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  - If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture, which is true according to the given constraints. Therefore, E can be true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures, each on a different topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian will give one lecture on one of the topics.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time.
  - The schedule of the lectures must satisfy the following constraints:
    - Oil paintings and watercolors lectures are before the lithographs lecture.
    - Farley's lecture is before the oil paintings lecture.
    - Holden's lecture is before both Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.
    
A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. (Possible)
B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. (Possible)
C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture. (Possible)
D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. (Impossible, because Farley's lecture must be before the oil paintings lecture and Holden's lecture must be before Farley's lecture. This creates a contradiction.)
E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture. (Possible)

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures on different topics. 
  The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

Elimination:
  A: If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. But we know that the oil paintings lecture must be after Farley's lecture, so this is not possible.
  B: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, but we do not know the order of the first two lectures, so this is possible.
  C: If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, but we do not know the order of the first two lectures, so this is possible.
  D: If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, but we do not know the order of the first two lectures, so this is possible.
  E: If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, but we do not know the order of the first two lectures, so this is possible.

  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then R, S, T, U, W, and X must be mentioned in the first six chapters.
  
Analysis: 
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then R, S, T, U, W, and X must be mentioned in the first six chapters. 
  We know that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it can only be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3. 
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. So, if T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and if T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if W is mentioned in chapter 5, then X must be mentioned in chapter 7, and if W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if X is mentioned in chapter 4, then U must be mentioned in chapter 3, and if X is mentioned in chapter 7, then U must be mentioned in chapter 6.

Action: Answer("E")  
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 7. If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then U must be mentioned in chapter 3, and if X is mentioned in chapter 7, then U must be mentioned in chapter 6. In either case, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, so options A, B, and C are not possible. Option D is not possible because U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, the only possible option is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each of seven different clues is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 7 because W must be mentioned after T and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. If W is not in chapter 7, then X cannot be in chapter 7 either because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X must be in chapter 6 or earlier.

  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. This is possible, as there are no constraints on the placement of R.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3. This is possible, as there are no constraints on the placement of S.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4. This is possible, as T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and must be mentioned before W.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1. This is not possible, as U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters and X must be in chapter 6 or earlier.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5. This is possible, as U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters and X must be in chapter 6 or earlier.

Action: Answer("E")

  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  - Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
  
  A: There are two chapters between chapter 3 and chapter 7, and Z is mentioned in chapter 7, so R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 because R cannot be mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  B: There are two chapters between chapter 3 and chapter 7, and Z is mentioned in chapter 7. Since S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  C: There are two chapters between chapter 4 and chapter 7, and Z is mentioned in chapter 7. T must be mentioned before W, so T cannot be in chapter 7. Therefore, T must be in chapter 4. This option is possible.
  D: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  E: There are two chapters between chapter 5 and chapter 7, and Z is mentioned in chapter 7. U and X must be in adjacent chapters, so U must be in chapter 5 and X must be in chapter 6. Therefore, this option is possible.

Action: Answer("C") or Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven chapters in total, and each of the seven clues must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  - Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T can only be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3, and W can only be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6.
  - Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then S must be mentioned in chapter 6 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  - Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5 and X must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  - Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then U must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then the order of the clues in the chapters would be: T (Chapter 2), R (Chapter 1), S (Chapter 3), U (Chapter 6), X (Chapter 7), W (Chapter 5), and Z (Chapter 7). All of the constraints are satisfied, and Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. There are seven chapters in the novel, one clue per chapter, and each of the seven clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z) must be mentioned exactly once.
  2. T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and T must be mentioned before W, with two chapters separating the mention of T and W.
  3. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  4. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  5. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then we know that neither S nor W can be mentioned in chapter 6. From the constraints, we also know that T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 either. Thus, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 5. If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, as S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 3. If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then X must be mentioned in chapter 6, as U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. From the constraints, we know that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 3, and R must be mentioned in chapter 2. 
  
Solution:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then:
  - R is mentioned in chapter 3 if T is mentioned in chapter 4. Therefore, (A) is not true.
  - S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 if T is mentioned in chapter 4. Therefore, (B) is not true.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, (C) is not true.
  - U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, as U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, (D) is not true.
  - X must be mentioned in chapter 6 if T is mentioned in chapter 5. Therefore, (E) is not true.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The novel consists of seven chapters, with one of seven different clues mentioned exactly once in each chapter.
  - Clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z are mentioned in the novel.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating them.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then we know that S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 7. This would mean that U is mentioned in chapter 5, which satisfies the requirement that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, and T must be mentioned in chapter 2. This satisfies the requirement that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and that T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating them.
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 5, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7. This satisfies the requirement that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then R must be mentioned in chapter 5, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7. This satisfies the requirement that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2. This satisfies the requirement that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, but it violates the requirement that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  There are seven chapters in the novel: chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then we know that Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  
  A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5. This would mean that X would have to be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5. This would mean that X would have to be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7, and X must be mentioned in chapter 6. This means that U must be mentioned in chapter 5, and S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5. This would mean that T would have to be mentioned in chapter 3, which violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  E: If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, and W must be mentioned in chapter 7. This means that T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, E could be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  2. T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  3. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  4. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  5. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  6. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6. So, S must be mentioned in chapter 3, 4 or 5. Since W must be mentioned after T and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4. If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which is not allowed because Z is mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4. Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, X cannot be mentioned in chapter 4. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 5. Finally, R must be mentioned in chapter 1 or 2. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The mystery novel consists of seven chapters and each of the seven different clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  
Analysis:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 5 at the latest. 
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 5. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 5 to satisfy the constraint that T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. 
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 7. 
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4, and U must be mentioned in chapter 5. But U cannot be mentioned in chapter 7, so R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5, W must be mentioned in chapter 7, and X must be mentioned in chapter 6. But X cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, so S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, X must be mentioned in chapter 7, and U must be mentioned in chapter 5. But U cannot be mentioned in chapter 7, so T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 4. But Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, so U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, W must be mentioned in chapter 7, and S must be mentioned in chapter 2. But Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, so X cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:

  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then we know that neither Z nor S can be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, U and X must be mentioned in chapters 6 and 7 in some order. Also, T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in either chapter 5 or 6. 

A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 5 and X must be mentioned in chapter 6. This leaves chapter 4 for U and chapter 1 for S. However, this violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, A is not possible.

B: If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 5 and X must be mentioned in chapter 6. This leaves chapter 4 for U and chapter 1 for R. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, B could be true.

C: If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6 and X must be mentioned in chapter 7. This means that U must be mentioned in chapter 5, leaving chapter 2 for S and chapter 3 for R. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, C could be true.

D: If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 4 and T must be mentioned in chapter 6. This leaves chapter 3 for S and chapter 5 for R. However, this violates the constraint that T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, D is not possible.

E: If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4 and W must be mentioned in chapter 6. This means that T must be mentioned in chapter 3, leaving chapter 2 for S and chapter 1 for R. However, this violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students left to assign to the four years.
  
Analysis:
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then it would be impossible to assign a student to 1923, since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Thus, A is not possible.
  
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then it would be impossible to assign Onyx to a year, since Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Thus, B is not possible.
  
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then it would be impossible to assign Louis to a year, since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Thus, C is not possible.
  
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and either Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. This leaves two students (Louis and Tiffany) to be assigned to 1921 and 1922. This is possible, so D could be true.
  
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to 1922. This leaves two students (Mollie and Onyx) to be assigned to 1921 and 1923. However, neither Mollie nor Onyx can be assigned to 1923, so E is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are four years to be assigned to four different students: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available.
  A: We cannot have four students assigned to the project without Louis since Louis is the only one who can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  C: If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. This leaves three students available for the remaining three years, which is possible. Therefore, this could be true.
  D: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 (because Tiffany is not available). This means that Louis must be assigned to 1921 and Mollie must be assigned to 1924. Therefore, this could be true.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 (because Louis is the only other student who can be assigned to 1923). This means that Ryan must be assigned to the year before Tiffany's (because Tiffany is not available). This leaves Mollie and Onyx to be assigned to 1921 and 1922, respectively. Therefore, this could be true.
Action: Answer("C") or Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then only five students are available for this project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then only five students are available for this project. 
  Only four years are available for this project, so one student will not be assigned to the project. 
  Therefore, one of the students will not be assigned to any year and the other four students will be assigned to one of the four years. 
  We need to determine which of the answer choices could be possible under these conditions.

A: Louis is not assigned to the project. 
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then he is the student that is not assigned to any year. 
  However, we know that Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and if Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. 
  This means that Louis cannot be the student that is not assigned to any year. 
  Therefore, A is not possible.

B: Ryan is not assigned to the project. 
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then he is the student that is not assigned to any year. 
  However, we know that if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. 
  This means that Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1924, and therefore, Ryan cannot be the student that is not assigned to any year. 
  Therefore, B is not possible.

C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project. 
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then she is the student that is not assigned to any year. 
  We know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. 
  Therefore, C is possible.

D: Onyx is assigned to 1922. 
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. 
  This leaves Mollie and Louis to be assigned to 1921 and 1924, but we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
  Therefore, D is not possible.

E: Louis is assigned to 1924. 
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. 
  This leaves Mollie and Onyx to be assigned to 1921 and 1922. 
  Ryan cannot be assigned to any of the years because Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. 
  Therefore, E is not possible.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The history project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Six students are available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project:
  A: It is possible that Louis is not assigned to the project, but it is also possible that Louis is assigned to one of the other three years.
  B: It is possible that Ryan is not assigned to the project, but it is also possible that Ryan is assigned to one of the other three years.
  C: It is possible that Tiffany is not assigned to the project, but it is also possible that Tiffany is assigned to one of the other three years.
  D: It is possible that Onyx is assigned to 1922, since this year is not affected by any of the conditions.
  E: It is not possible that Louis is assigned to 1924, since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923 and if Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. However, if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's (i.e. 1922), leaving no year for Louis to be assigned to.

Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - Six students are available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Solution:
  - If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project.
  - The project requires four students to be assigned to one of the four years.
  - Since Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio are the only students available for the project, one of them must not be assigned to any year.
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. But Ryan must also be assigned to the project, which means that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This leaves only two years (1921 and 1922) for Mollie and Yoshio, but Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 because Tiffany is already assigned to the project. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. But if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. This leaves only two years (1921 and 1922) for Mollie and Yoshio, but Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 because Louis is already assigned to the project. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923 and Ryan cannot be assigned to the project. This leaves only two years (1921 and 1922) for Mollie and Yoshio, and Mollie can be assigned to either year. Therefore, this option is possible.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, and Louis must be assigned to 1921. This leaves only one year (1922) for Mollie and Yoshio, but Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 because Onyx is already assigned to the year. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921. This leaves only one year (1924) for Mollie and Yoshio, but Mollie cannot be assigned to 1924 because Louis is already assigned to the year. Therefore, this option is not possible.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- There are 4 years in the project: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
- Each year is assigned to exactly one student.
- Conditions:
  - Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923 (but not both).
  - If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned.
  - If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned, then there are 5 students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  If we try to assign the students to the years based on the conditions, we can see that:
  - If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. This is because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and Louis is already assigned. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to another year, which means Ryan cannot be assigned. This violates the condition that if Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. This means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922 (the year immediately prior to Ryan's). Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922 because she must be assigned to a year with Tiffany, and Tiffany is assigned to 1923. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1924, and Louis must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. This means that Louis cannot be assigned to 1923. 
  - If Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project. This means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922 (the year immediately prior to Ryan's). Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922 because she must be assigned to a year with Tiffany, and Tiffany is assigned to 1923. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1924, and Louis must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. This means that Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. This means that Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project because Ryan is already assigned. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1923, Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and Tiffany cannot be assigned. This means that Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.
  
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- There are four years to be assigned to four students.
- Six students are available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: 
- If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project.
- From the given conditions, we can infer that Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and if Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must also be assigned.
- If Yoshio is not assigned, then he cannot be assigned to any of the four years.
- If Mollie is assigned, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. This means that one of the other students must be assigned to 1924, and it cannot be Louis or Tiffany. 
- If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must also be assigned, which means that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This leaves only Mollie and Louis available for the remaining two years.
- If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which means that one of the other students must be assigned to 1924, and it cannot be Louis or Tiffany. This leaves only Mollie and Yoshio available for the remaining two years.
- Based on the above analysis, the only option that could be true is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922. 

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Each year has exactly one student assigned to it.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are five students available for four years. 
  Let's consider each option:
  A: If Louis is not assigned to the project, then the only possible years for Tiffany are 1923 or 1924. But Tiffany can only be assigned to 1923, which means that Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is not possible because there are no more years available. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to the project, and this option is not possible.
  B: If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. But Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which means that Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  C: If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project. But if Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923, which contradicts the conditions of the problem. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  D: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, and Louis must be assigned to 1921. This leaves Mollie as the only student available, and she must be assigned to the remaining year, which is 1922. Therefore, this option is possible.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to the remaining year, which is 1921. This leaves Mollie and Onyx as the only students available, and they must be assigned to 1922 and 1923, respectively. However, if Onyx is assigned to 1923, then Ryan cannot be assigned to 1921, which contradicts the conditions of the problem. Therefore, this option is not possible.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  We need to find an option that could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project. 
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the number of students available for the project is 5. 
  The following conditions apply: 
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. 
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  Let's evaluate each option:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
     If Louis is not assigned to the project, then the only option left for 1923 is Tiffany. But the condition says that "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923". Therefore, this option cannot be true.
     
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
     If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then the condition "If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project" is violated. Therefore, this option cannot be true.
     
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
     If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then the only option left for 1923 is Louis. But the condition says that "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923". Therefore, this option cannot be true.
     
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
     If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, this option could be true.
     
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
     If Louis is assigned to 1924, then the only option left for 1923 is Tiffany. But the condition says that "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923". Therefore, this option cannot be true.
     
  The only option that could be true is D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. M is published in the fall.
  2. M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  3. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  4. K and N must be published in the same season.
  5. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.

Using the above information, we can determine that:
- M is in the fall, so N must be in the spring.
- K and N must be in the same season, so K must also be in the spring.
- If K is in the spring, O must be in the spring.

Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is L and O.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - M cannot be published in the same season as P.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other, but it is not specified which season.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, so N cannot be one of the books published in the fall with M.
  - If M is published in the fall, K cannot be published in the fall because if K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall, which is not possible since N must be published in the spring.
  - Since K cannot be published in the fall with M, L cannot be published in the fall with M because if K and L are both published in the fall, then N must also be published in the fall, which is not possible.
  - Therefore, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M are O and P.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, K cannot be published in the fall with M, since N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.

Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K cannot be published in the fall with M, since K and N must be published in the same season as each other. This leaves us with two options: O and P. According to the given conditions, M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Solution:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring (according to condition 4). Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall. If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall (according to condition 3). Therefore, K and O cannot be published in the spring. Since K and N must be published in the same season as each other (according to condition 2), and N cannot be published in the fall (as we have just established), it follows that K and N must be published in the fall. Therefore, we can eliminate answer choices B, C, and D. We are left with A and E. Since M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other (according to condition 1), it follows that P cannot be published in the fall if M is published in the fall. Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  - K and N must be published in the same season.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be a valid option.
  - K and N must be published in the same season. If N cannot be published in the fall, then K cannot be published in the fall either. Therefore, K is not a valid option.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. But we don't know if K will be published in the fall, so we cannot assume that O will be published in the fall.
  - Since M cannot be published in the same season as P, P is not a valid option.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The only pair of cookbooks that can be published in the fall with M, based on the given conditions, are L and O.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. P cannot be published in the fall because M is already published in the fall. L can only be published in the spring. Therefore, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M are K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, which means K and O must be published in the fall. Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is (K and O), and the answer is not among the choices.
  L cannot be published in the fall with M because L cannot be published in the same season as either K or O.
  P cannot be published in the fall with M because M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  Therefore, the only option left is (N and 0).

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, and K and O must be published in the fall. Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. This means that either L or P must also be published in the fall. However, P cannot be published in the fall because M is already in the fall. Therefore, the only option is for L to be published in the fall with M.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  We need to find a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M. 
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. We don't know if K is published in the fall, so we cannot say if O will be published in the fall or not. 
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall with M.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, if K is published in the fall, N must also be published in the fall. If K is not published in the fall, N cannot be published in the fall.

Solution:
  We cannot select option B because N cannot be published in the fall with M. 
  We cannot select option C because O cannot be published in the fall with M. 
  We cannot select option D because P cannot be published in the fall with M. 
  We cannot select option E because P cannot be published in the fall with M. 
  Therefore, the only option left is A, which includes K and O. If M is published in the fall, and if K is also published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. Hence, the answer is A.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the first three compositions must be performed in such a way that there is at least one composition performed between them and composition P must be performed before S.
  
  A: F, H, P - If F is performed fifth, then there is only one composition between F and S, which contradicts the given conditions. Also, H cannot be the eighth composition performed because L and H are the choices for the eighth composition.
  B: H, P, L - If H is the first composition performed, then O must be the fifth composition performed, which contradicts the given conditions. Also, L cannot be the eighth composition performed because O is performed either first or fifth.
  C: O, P, R - This is a possible arrangement. If O is performed first, then L must be the eighth composition performed. If O is performed fifth, then H must be the eighth composition performed. Also, P is performed before S, which satisfies the given conditions.
  D: O, P, T - If O is performed first, then L must be the eighth composition performed, which contradicts the given conditions. If O is performed fifth, then H must be the eighth composition performed, which also contradicts the given conditions.
  E: P, R, T - If P is performed first, then O must be the fifth composition performed, which contradicts the given conditions. If P is performed second, then S must be performed fifth, which also contradicts the given conditions.
  
  Therefore, the answer is C: O, P, R.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then we know that P must be performed before the fourth composition. So the possible compositions that could be performed before S are O, L, H, T, and R. 
  
  A: F, H, P - If P is performed third, then the only composition that could be performed before P is O. However, O cannot be performed before F or R, so this order is not possible.
  B: H, P. L - If S is performed fourth, then P cannot be performed second, so this order is not possible.
  C: O, P, R - If O is performed first, then P must be performed second. If S is performed fourth, then the only composition that could be performed before S is L or H. Since L or H is performed last, then it is possible that O, P, and R are performed first, second, and third, respectively. 
  D: O, P, T - If O is performed first, then P must be performed second. If S is performed fourth, then the only composition that could be performed before S is L or H. Since L or H is performed last, then T cannot be performed third. So this order is not possible.
  E: P, R, T - If S is performed fourth, then P must be performed before the fourth composition. So the only compositions that could be performed before P are O, L, H, T, and R. However, if P is performed first, then the only composition that could be performed before P is O. Since O cannot be performed before F or R, then this order is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 compositions: F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T.
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed first, second, and third must be either O, P, and R or F, H, and P.
  
  A: F, H, P - P is performed before S, but F and H cannot be performed after P and before S. Incorrect.
  B: H, P. L - P is performed before S, but L cannot be the eighth composition. Incorrect.
  C: O, P, R - This option satisfies all the conditions and is a possible order. Keep this option.
  D: O, P, T - T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Incorrect.
  E: P, R, T - P is performed before S, but T cannot be performed after P and before S. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S must be O and P. Thus, either O or P must be performed first. If O is performed first, then R must be performed second and F must be performed third. If P is performed first, then R must be performed second and T must be performed third.
  
  A: F, H, P - P is performed before S, so this is not possible.
  B: H, P. L - P is performed before S, so this is not possible.
  C: O, P, R - This is a possible order. O is performed first, then P, and then R. 
  D: O, P, T - This is a possible order. P is performed before S, then O, and then T.
  E: P, R, T - P is performed before S, so this is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The compositions will be performed consecutively, one at a time, in a specific order.
  T can be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, we know that P needs to be performed before S. Also, we know that O can be performed either first or fifth. If O is performed first, then P can be performed second and R can be performed third. If O is performed fifth, then F and T need to be performed before P. Therefore, P can be performed third and R can be performed second. Hence, we have two possible orders for the first three compositions: O, P, R or F, T, P.
  
  A: F, H, P - This is not possible based on the given information.
  B: H, P. L - This is not possible based on the given information.
  C: O, P, R - This is possible based on the given information. 
  D: O, P, T - This is not possible based on the given information.
  E: P, R, T - This is not possible based on the given information.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the compositions must satisfy certain conditions, including:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, we know that P must be performed before S. Also, since S is not the first composition, we know that O is performed first. This means that the order of the first three compositions must be O, P, and one of the compositions that can be performed between F and R.
  
  A: F cannot be performed immediately after P, so this is not a possible order.
  B: H is the eighth composition, so it cannot be performed third. This is not a possible order.
  C: R cannot be performed immediately after P, so this is not a possible order.
  D: This is a possible order. O is performed first, followed by P, and then T is performed immediately after P.
  E: This is not a possible order because P must be performed before S, which is performed fourth.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  3. O is performed either first or fifth.
  4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  5. P is performed at some time before S.
  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then we know that compositions performed first, second, and third must be chosen from F, H, L, O, P, R, and T.
  
  A: F, H, P - If P is performed third, then S cannot be performed after P. This contradicts condition 5.
  B: H, P. L - If S is performed fourth, then P cannot be performed second. This contradicts condition 5.
  C: O, P, R - If O is performed first and P is performed second, then S cannot be performed fourth. This contradicts the question.
  D: O, P, T - If O is performed first and P is performed second, then S cannot be performed fourth. This contradicts the question.
  E: P, R, T - If P is performed first, then O cannot be performed first. This contradicts condition 3.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time.
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S are O, some composition (X), P, and some composition (Y), where X and Y are either F, H, L, R, or T. The composition performed after S is either F, H, L, R or T. 
  A: F, H, P -> F and H cannot be performed before S, and P cannot be performed after S.
  B: H, P. L -> H cannot be performed before S.
  C: O, P, R -> Possible, but we do not know the order of the remaining compositions.
  D: O, P, T -> Possible, and T can be performed immediately after O.
  E: P, R, T -> R cannot be performed before S, and T cannot be performed immediately after S.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The compositions must be performed consecutively and one composition at a time.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that are performed after P and before S must be O, R, and F, in some order. 
  The compositions that are performed before P must be either L or H, but not both.
  Since O is performed either first or fifth, and it cannot be performed fifth since P must be performed before S, O must be performed first.
  Therefore, the compositions that are performed after O and before S in some order are R and F.
  Since T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and S is performed fourth, T must be performed last.
  The compositions that are performed before P must be either L or H, but not both. Since the eighth composition performed is either L or H, and T is performed last, then P must be performed before L or H, which means that either L or H will be performed seventh.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, could be O, P, and T.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the following must be true:
  - One of the compositions F or R must be performed either first, second, or third.
  - The other composition of F or R must be performed either fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  
  A: H cannot be performed before S.
  B: H cannot be performed before S.
  C: If O is performed first, then P and R must be performed next, which violates the condition that at least two compositions are performed between F and R. If O is performed fifth, then F and R must be performed next, which also violates the condition that at least two compositions are performed between F and R.
  D: If T is performed after P, then the only possible order is O, P, T. If T is performed before P, then the only possible order is O, T, P. Both options satisfy the conditions.
  E: If T is performed after R, then the only possible order is F, R, T. This violates the condition that at least two compositions are performed between F and R. If T is performed before F, then the only possible order is T, F, R. This also violates the condition that at least two compositions are performed between F and R.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  If bay 4 holds grain, then bay 5 must hold livestock and bay 6 must hold textiles. But this would mean that the bay holding textiles is not next to the bay holding produce, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, grain cannot be held in bay 4.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  Bay 1, 2, and 3 cannot hold the type of cargo that cannot be held in bay 4 because it has to be one of the remaining three types of cargo. 
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo, which is not the type that cannot be held in bay 4, so it cannot be the answer.
  The remaining bay is bay 6, which holds the remaining type of cargo. However, we cannot determine which type of cargo it is.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo and bay 6 holds another of the six types of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
  From the above, we can deduce that:
  1. Bay 1 cannot hold livestock, textiles, or produce;
  2. Bay 6 cannot hold grain, textiles, or produce;
  3. Bay 2 cannot hold livestock, textiles, or produce;
  4. Bay 5 cannot hold fuel or produce.
  
  Therefore, the potential cargos that could be held in Bay 4 are: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  
Analysis:
  Bay 4 is not adjacent to the bay holding textiles. Therefore, it is possible that textiles is held in Bay 4.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis: 
  Since the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, bay 3 must hold produce and bay 4 must hold textiles. Because bay 5 must hold fuel, according to the statement "The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel." Therefore, bay 2 must hold grain, and bay 1 must hold livestock. Then, according to the statement "The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.", bay 3 cannot hold grain. Machinery is the only type of cargo that has not been assigned to any of the bays yet. Therefore, the answer is C: machinery.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we can deduce that:
  - Bay 6 cannot hold grain because the bay holding grain should have a higher number than the bay holding livestock, which is bay 5.
  - Bay 1 cannot hold textiles because the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, which is bay 6.
  - Bay 2 cannot hold fuel because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - Bay 3 cannot hold produce because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, and the bay holding fuel is either bay 1 or bay 2.
  - Bay 5 cannot hold machinery because there is no indication that it should hold a lower number than any other bay.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
Therefore, the type of cargo that CANNOT be held in bay 4 is grain.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds either fuel or produce. 
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are six bays and six types of cargo, and each bay holds a different type of cargo.

Bay 1: Either fuel or produce
Bay 2: Either fuel or produce
Bay 3: Either textiles or livestock
Bay 4: Either grain or machinery
Bay 5: Either textiles or livestock
Bay 6: Either grain or machinery

Option A: Grain can be held in Bay 4.
Option B: Livestock cannot be held in Bay 4.
Option C: Machinery can be held in Bay 4.
Option D: Produce can be held in Bay 4.
Option E: Textiles can be held in Bay 4.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds either fuel or produce.
  Bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  Bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  Bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  There are exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly 6 bays numbered 1 through 6 from one side of the dock to the other.
  - There are exactly 6 types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  - Grain is held in a higher-numbered bay than livestock.
  - Livestock is held in a higher-numbered bay than textiles.
  - Produce is held in a higher-numbered bay than fuel.
  - Textiles are held in a bay next to that of produce.
  
Analysis:
  - Since textiles are next to produce, the bay holding textiles must be bay 3 or bay 5.
  - The bay holding produce must be higher-numbered than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, the bay holding produce must be either bay 5 or bay 6.
  - Livestock is held in a higher-numbered bay than textiles. Therefore, the bay holding textiles cannot be bay 6.
  - Grain is held in a higher-numbered bay than livestock. Therefore, the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 6, either.
  - Therefore, the bay holding textiles must be bay 3, and the bay holding produce must be bay 5.
  - Since machinery is not mentioned in any of the rules, it could be held in any of the remaining bays: 1, 2, or 4.
  - Therefore, the type of cargo that CANNOT be held in bay 4 is either grain, livestock, produce, or textiles.
  - However, we have already determined that textiles must be held in bay 3, and produce must be held in bay 5.
  - Therefore, the type of cargo that CANNOT be held in bay 4 is either grain or livestock.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds the type of cargo that has the lowest number.
  Bay 6 holds the type of cargo that has the highest number.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
  Bay 4 is neither the first nor the last bay.
  Bay 4 is not next to the bay holding textiles.
  Therefore, the type of cargo held in bay 4 must be one of fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  
Analysis:
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, grain cannot be in bay 4.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, livestock cannot be in bay 4.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, produce cannot be in bay 4.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Therefore, textiles cannot be in bay 4.
  This means that machinery must be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo, Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types, and so on until Bay 6 holds the remaining cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Therefore, the order of the bays and the cargo types is: 1-?, 2-?, 3-fuel, 4-?, 5-livestock, 6-grain.
  Bay 4 can't hold produce because produce is located in a higher-numbered bay.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students will display exactly two paintings each, one oil and one watercolor.
  - Two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Using the given conditions, we can create a table to keep track of the positions of the paintings and the walls on which they are displayed:

|       | Wall 1 | Wall 2 | Wall 3 | Wall 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Upper |        |        |        | Greene |
| Lower |        |        |        | Isaacs |

From the given information, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position on the wall where Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, we can fill in the table as follows:

|       | Wall 1 | Wall 2 | Wall 3 | Wall 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Upper |        |        |        | Greene |
| Lower | Franz  |        |        | Isaacs |

Now we can use process of elimination to determine which statement must be true. 

A: We don't know where Greene's oil is displayed, so this statement cannot be determined to be true.
B: We cannot determine the location of Hidalgo's watercolor based on the information given, so this statement cannot be determined to be true.
C: Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the lower position on either wall 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, this statement is false.
D: Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor because each wall must have the work of at least two students displayed on it. Therefore, this statement is false.
E: We already know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position on wall 4, so this statement must be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The exhibition room has 4 walls, with 2 paintings displayed on each wall.
  Each of the 4 art students will display 2 paintings.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

To answer this question, we need to determine what must be true if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor. 

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that:
- Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall from Franz's oil.
- Isaacs's oil must be displayed on a different wall from Franz's watercolor.
- Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall from Greene's oil.

Therefore, we can eliminate choices B, D, and E because they involve Isaacs's watercolor, which must be displayed on a different wall from Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor.

We can also eliminate choice A because we do not know where Greene's oil is displayed. It could be in an upper or lower position.

That leaves us with choice C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. This must be true because we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. If Greene's oil is also displayed on that same wall, then it must be in the lower position, which means that the only remaining upper position on that wall must be filled by Hidalgo's oil. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The exhibition will have 4 walls with 2 paintings each, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  Each of the 4 students will display 1 oil and 1 watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Reasoning:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that:
  - Wall 1, 2, or 3 must have both of their positions occupied by paintings from two different students, as wall 4 already has one of Isaacs's paintings.
  - Wall 1 cannot have both of its positions occupied by paintings from two different students, because one of them would have to be either Franz or Isaacs, which is not allowed.
  - Wall 2 cannot have both of its positions occupied by paintings from two different students, because Greene's watercolor is already in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Wall 3 cannot have both of its positions occupied by paintings from two different students, because it would have to have either Franz's or Isaacs's painting, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that wall 1 has both of its positions occupied by paintings from two different students, and one of those students is Franz.

Answer: Answer("C") Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students displaying two paintings each.
  2. There are four walls (1, 2, 3, and 4) in the exhibition room.
  3. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  4. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  5. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  6. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  7. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  8. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  Condition: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?

Analysis:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then one of the following two possibilities must occur:
  1. Franz's watercolor is displayed in an upper position on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  2. Franz's watercolor is displayed in a lower position on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  
  If #1 is true, then Greene's oil will be displayed in a lower position. If #2 is true, then Greene's oil will be displayed in an upper position. 
  We have to determine which of the options must be true given the mentioned conditions.

Consider the options:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. - This could be true if Franz's watercolor is displayed in a lower position on the same wall as Greene's oil. However, it is not a must be true statement.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. - This is not a must be true statement as there is no mention of Hidalgo's paintings or the placement of Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. - This could be true if Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position on the wall where Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position and Franz's watercolor is displayed in a lower position. However, it is not a must be true statement.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. - This could be true if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 4 where Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position. Therefore, this is a must be true statement.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position. - This could be true as Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. However, it is not a must be true statement.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are four art students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  - Two paintings (an oil and a watercolor) will be displayed by each student.
  - Each wall of the exhibition room will have exactly two paintings (one in the upper position and one in the lower position).
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the wall containing Greene's watercolor must be either wall 3 or wall 4. If Greene's watercolor is on wall 3, then Hidalgo's watercolor must also be on wall 3 (since each wall has exactly two paintings and no wall has only watercolors). However, since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, this would mean that Hidalgo's oil is also on wall 3, which violates the condition that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be on wall 4. Since Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4, Hidalgo's oil must be in the upper position of wall 4 (since each wall has exactly one oil and one watercolor). This means that Hidalgo's watercolor is on wall 1 or wall 2. However, if Hidalgo's watercolor is on wall 1, then Isaacs's watercolor must also be on wall 1 (since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it), which violates the condition that no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be on wall 2. This means that Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 1, and since Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4, Isaacs's watercolor must be in the upper position of wall 1. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be in the upper position of wall 4, which means that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. Thus, the answer is C.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) are displaying a total of 8 paintings (2 paintings per student).
  - There are 4 walls, each displaying exactly 2 paintings (one in the upper position and one in the lower position).
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that:
  - Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor are already on a wall together (let's call it Wall X).
  - Since each wall has exactly 2 paintings, we know that Wall X still needs one oil and one watercolor painting.
  - Hidalgo and Isaacs are the only students left that have not yet been placed on Wall X.
  - Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs on it, we know that Hidalgo's paintings must be on Wall X.
  - Since no wall can have only watercolors, we know that Hidalgo's paintings on Wall X must include one oil painting.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's oil painting must be on Wall X in either the upper or lower position.
  
  A: We don't know where Greene's oil painting is displayed, so this is not necessarily true.
  B: We don't know where Isaacs's watercolor painting is displayed, so this is not necessarily true.
  C: This is true based on the reasoning above.
  D: We know that Hidalgo's oil painting must be on Wall X, but we don't know where Isaacs's watercolor painting is displayed, so this is not necessarily true.
  E: We know that Isaacs's watercolor painting is displayed in a lower position on Wall 4, so this is not necessarily true. 

Therefore, the answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student displays exactly two paintings: one oil and one watercolor.
  Two paintings are displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, it means that Franz's oil is not displayed on that wall. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, it means that Greene's oil is displayed in the lower position of that wall. This also means that both paintings displayed on that wall belong to Greene and Franz. Therefore, Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on a different wall. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, it means that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. Thus, the answer is C.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
To be true, the statement must be a logical consequence of the given conditions. 

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
- Greene's watercolor must be on a different wall than Franz's oil, because no wall can have both paintings by the same student.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in an upper position, because it is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil, which must be in the lower position according to the condition "one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position" for each wall.
- Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on the same wall as Hidalgo's watercolor, because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, and two watercolors are already on the wall with Greene's watercolor and Franz's oil.
- Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, because no wall can have only one student's work displayed on it, and the other two walls already have two students' works displayed on them.
- Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, because Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then it must be on wall 1 (since Greene's watercolor is already on the wall where Franz's oil is displayed).
  - Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1, since that would mean wall 1 has only watercolors displayed on it, which is not allowed.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3 or 4.
  - Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, and no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, it follows that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor (which is either wall 1 or wall 2).
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. Hence, Answer("D").
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - Two paintings of each student will be displayed.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: 
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Hidalgo's paintings (oil and watercolor) cannot be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil or watercolor, and cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil, since Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. This means that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, so option B is not true. Also, Isaacs's watercolor is already in the lower position of wall 4, so option E is not true. Therefore, the answer is: Answer("D").

  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then there are only two possible locations for the pharmacy: next to the optometrist or next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then there are only two possible locations for the pharmacy: next to the optometrist or next to the veterinarian.
  - Let's assume that the pharmacy is next to the optometrist, then the veterinarian cannot be in space 2 or 6. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 4.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 1, 2, and 3 or spaces 5, 6, and 7.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7, and one of the restaurants must be in space 7 or 1, respectively.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7, and the other restaurant must be in space 5 or 6. This violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, and the restaurant must be in space 1.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the toy store must be in space 2 or 6.
  - If the toy store is in space 2, then the shoe store must be in space 3, and the other restaurant must be in space 5. This satisfies all the constraints.
  - Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and the toy store.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Only one type of cookie can be baked per day.
  2. Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  3. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  4. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  5. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Using the given information, we can deduce the following:
  - There are a total of 9 batches of cookies (3 kinds of cookies x 3 batches of each kind)
  - Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, each day must have a different type of cookie.
  - We know what type of cookie is made on Thursday (sugar), so we can deduce what types of cookies are made on the other days.
  - Since only one batch of cookies is made on Friday, it must be the third batch of a particular type of cookie.

A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. This is not possible since we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, A is not true.

B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday. This is not possible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, B is not true.

C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. This is possible since only one batch of cookies is made on Friday and it must be the third batch of a particular type of cookie. Therefore, C could be true.

D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. This is not possible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, D is not true.

E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. This is possible since the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, E could be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we can have a maximum of 2 batches made on any one of the other 4 days.
  
Analysis:
  Let's start with the given options one by one:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
     This cannot be true because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, but it cannot be a batch of sugar cookies because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
     This cannot be true because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. But we don't know which day the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made, so it's not possible to say which day the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
     This could be true. If we assume that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday. This leaves Friday for the third batch of oatmeal cookies.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
     This could be true. If we assume that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday. This leaves Tuesday for the first batch of peanut butter cookies and Thursday for the second batch of sugar cookies. This leaves Friday for the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
     This cannot be true because we know that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on one of the days from Tuesday to Friday, leaving only three days for the three batches of oatmeal cookies, which is not possible because the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
     
Solution:
  From the given options, the only possible answer is D. 
  Therefore, Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - A total of 3 x 3 = 9 batches of cookies are made each week (3 batches of each kind of cookie).
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are two possible scenarios:
    1. One batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, and the other two batches are made on the other two days (Tuesday and Wednesday).
    2. One batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Friday, and the other two batches are made on the other two days (Tuesday and Wednesday).
  - We can use the given conditions to eliminate the choices that cannot be true and identify the one that could be true.

Elimination:
  - A: The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because there are only two batches made on Tuesday (one oatmeal and one peanut butter).
  - C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because only one batch is made on Friday.
  - D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because there are only two batches made on Wednesday (one peanut butter and one sugar).
  - E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because there are only two batches made on Tuesday (one oatmeal and one peanut butter).

Action: Answer("A")  
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each type of cookies are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are two possibilities: one batch of oatmeal, one batch of peanut butter, and one batch of sugar were made on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively; OR two batches of oatmeal, two batches of peanut butter, and one batch of sugar were made on Monday through Thursday, and only one batch of sugar was made on Friday.
  - From the given conditions, we know that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is not made on Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday. Therefore, it must be made on Wednesday or Friday.
  - From the given conditions, we know that the third batch of sugar cookies is not made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Therefore, it must be made on Thursday or Friday.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  - If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday. This means that the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday, leaving only one batch of oatmeal cookies to be made on Tuesday. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday. This satisfies the condition that the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one. 
  - Therefore, the answer is D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are three kinds of cookies and three batches of each kind are made each week, there are a total of 9 batches made each week.
  - If one batch is made on Friday, then a total of 4 batches are made from Monday to Thursday.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the other three batches made on Monday to Wednesday must be one batch of each kind of cookie.
  - From the given conditions, we know that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is not made on Thursday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is not made on Monday.
  - Therefore, the only possible option is that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, which means the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - Since exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, there are a total of 9 batches of cookies (3 batches/kind x 3 kinds) made each week.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so there are at most 8 batches of cookies made from Tuesday to Friday.
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are a total of 4 batches of cookies made from Monday to Friday.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on either Monday or Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  - If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday (since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day).
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday (choice D) because the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on either Monday or Tuesday, and the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday (choice E) because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday (choice A) because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday (choice B) because the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on either Monday or Tuesday.
  - Therefore, the only possible option is that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday (choice C).
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Using the given conditions, we can make a schedule:
Monday: oatmeal 1, peanut butter 1, sugar 1
Tuesday: oatmeal 2, peanut butter 3, sugar 2
Wednesday: oatmeal 3, peanut butter 2, sugar 3
Thursday: oatmeal 1, peanut butter 2, sugar 2
Friday: oatmeal 2, peanut butter 3, sugar 1

If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then it must be one of the following:
- oatmeal 2
- peanut butter 3
- sugar 1

A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. (Not possible as sugar 1 is made on Friday.)
B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday. (Not possible as oatmeal 1 is made on Monday.)
C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. (Not possible as only one batch is made on Friday.)
D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. (Not possible as peanut butter 2 is made on Wednesday.)
E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. (Possible as peanut butter 3 is made on Friday.)

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are a total of 14 batches of cookies made during the week. (3 kinds of cookies * 3 batches of each kind * 2 cookies per batch = 18 cookies; 18 cookies / 5 days = 3.6 cookies per day; 3.6 cookies per day * 5 days = 18 cookies)
  
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because there is at least one batch of cookies made on Monday, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because there is only one batch of cookies made on Friday, and all three kinds of cookies must be made during the week.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Tuesday. This would mean that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This leaves one batch of sugar cookies and one batch of oatmeal cookies to be made on Friday.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that one batch of one of the cookie types is made on Friday. 
  - We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so we can eliminate option A since it suggests that two batches of sugar cookies are made on the same day (Monday). 
  - We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so we can eliminate option C since it suggests that a batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. 
  - Option B suggests that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, but we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so this option is also eliminated. 
  - Option D suggests that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, which is possible since we know that no peanut butter cookies are made on Monday or Tuesday. 
  - Option E suggests that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, which is also possible given the information we have. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that there are already 2 batches of each cookie made from Monday to Thursday. Therefore, we can determine which batches of cookies were made on which day.
  - The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday, because the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  - The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday, because each kind of cookie is made in three batches, so there must be at least one batch of oatmeal cookies made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, because if the first batch of peanut butter cookies were made on Wednesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies would have to be made on Thursday, which is impossible because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - Therefore, the only possible option is that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.

Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?
Choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery

  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
Analysis:
  According to the given conditions, Screen 2 will show the 7 PM movie, which cannot be the romance. Also, the horror and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they can't be shown together on screen 2. The western starts before the horror film, so Western cannot be shown after the horror movie. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. Therefore, the only option that cannot be an accurate list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 is option C because it includes the western and sci-fi both, which are not allowed to be shown together on screen 2.

  4. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  
Analysis:
  According to the conditions, the western must be shown before the horror film, and the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. There are two possible arrangements for screen 2: 
  1. Sci-fi, mystery at 7 P.M. and horror, western at 9 P.M.
  2. Sci-fi, western at 7 P.M. and horror, mystery at 9 P.M.
  
  A. The sci-fi film and the horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 together.
  B. The sci-fi film and the mystery can be shown on screen 2 together at 7 P.M.

- The western begins at some time before the horror film.
- The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
- The romance is not shown on screen 2.
- The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
- Since screen 2 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., the movie that is shown at 7 P.M. cannot be shown on screen 3.
- The western must be shown before the horror film and cannot be shown on screen 2.
- The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
- The romance cannot be shown on screen 2.

Knowledge: 
  There are five movies showing at the theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.

Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are seven spaces in a straight row.
- There are seven businesses: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
- If the shoe store is in space 4, then the businesses next to it are in spaces 3 and 5.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
If the shoe store is in space 4, then the businesses next to it are in spaces 3 and 5. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist, and the veterinarian must be in space 7. Thus, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then spaces 3 and 5 must not be the toy store or the veterinarian.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7. 
  However, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1, as it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, which means it is next to the veterinarian. 
  Thus, (B) The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian must be true.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven businesses: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the shoe store is in space 4, the businesses occupying spaces 3 and 5 cannot be the toy store or veterinarian.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - If the shoe store is in space 4, then the businesses occupying spaces 3 and 5 cannot be the toy store or veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7. This means the two restaurants must be in spaces 2-3 and 5-6. But this arrangement would put the toy store next to the veterinarian, which is not allowed. Thus, the pharmacy must be in space 7, the restaurant must be in space 1, and the two restaurants must be in spaces 2-3 and 5-6. 
  - Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 2 or 6, and the veterinarian must be in space 1 or 3. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the veterinarian must be in space 1 and the optometrist must be in space 6. This means that the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, so B is the correct answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven businesses: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
Analysis: 
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, the pharmacy cannot be in space 4.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so neither restaurant can be in space 4.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and since the pharmacy cannot be in space 4, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 3 or 5.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or 5.
  - Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 2 or 6, and the optometrist must be in the other space.
  - Since the shoe store is in space 4, it cannot be next to the toy store or the veterinarian, so the only possibility is that the shoe store is next to one of the restaurants.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven spaces in a straight row numbered from 1 to 7.
  Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 4, it is not at an end of the row.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be at the other end of the row.
  Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 3 or 5.
  Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or 5.
  Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 2 or 6.
  The only space left for the toy store is space 3 or space 5.
  Therefore, the optometrist must be in the other space next to the pharmacy.
  Now, we can check the answer choices:
  A: The optometrist is not next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is not next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is not next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is not next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - There are seven businesses: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  

Explanation: 
  - Since the shoe store is in space 4, we can deduce that the two restaurants cannot be next to it, because if one of them is next to it, there will be no space for the other restaurant which has to be at the other end. Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 1-2-3 and 5-6-7, in some order.
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, we can deduce that the veterinarian must be in either space 2 or space 6.
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, we can deduce that the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7, and the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in the other of those two spaces.
  - Since the shoe store is in space 4, we can deduce that the toy store must be in either space 3 or space 5.
  - Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, which is true if the veterinarian is in space 2 and the pharmacy is in space 1.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  We are given that:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  We are also given that the shoe store is in space 4.
  A: We do not know the location of the optometrist, so we cannot say for sure that it is next to a restaurant. This statement might be true, but it is not necessarily true.
  B: The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the shoe store is in space 4. Since the shoe store is not next to the pharmacy, it must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. This statement is true.
  C: We do not know the location of the restaurants or the toy store, so we cannot say for sure that a restaurant is next to the toy store. This statement might be true, but it is not necessarily true.
  D: We are given that the shoe store is in space 4 and that it cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, this statement is false.

  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it can only be located in space 1 or 7. 
  Since the shoe store is in space 4, the optometrist and veterinarian must be in spaces 2 and 6, but we don't know which business is in which space yet.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so one of the restaurants must be in space 1 or 7, and the other must be in space 3 or 5.
  Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7 and the veterinarian must be in space 6.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, and the answer is B.
Response 9:
Knowledge:

  If the shoe store is in space 4, it is not next to the pharmacy.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If the shoe store is in space 4, we know that the pharmacy cannot be in spaces 1 or 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 2 or 6. According to the constraints, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the shoe store is in space 4 and cannot be next to the pharmacy, it must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. But we also know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the shoe store must be next to the optometrist and the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. Hence, the answer is B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.

Knowledge: 
  There are six colors of thread: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of the colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  There are exactly two solid rugs.
  
  If a rug is solid, it will be woven in a single color. So, each of the two solid rugs will use exactly one color.
  
Analysis:
  We need to determine which pairs of colors cannot be used in the two solid rugs. To do this, we can check which pairs of colors violate any of the given rules. 
  
  Choice A: forest and peach
    There is no rule that forbids the use of forest and peach in the same rug.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly 5 colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  In any rug where white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug where olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  There are exactly 2 solid rugs.
  
  A: It is possible to have a solid rug of forest color and a solid rug of peach color, because no rule prohibits it.
  B: It is possible to have a solid rug of forest color and a solid rug of yellow color, because no rule prohibits it.
  C: It is possible to have a solid rug of peach color and a solid rug of turquoise color, because no rule prohibits it.
  D: It is not possible to have a solid rug of peach color and a solid rug of yellow color, because the rule states that peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  E: It is possible to have a solid rug of turquoise color and a solid rug of yellow color, because no rule prohibits it.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 colors available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  - Exactly 5 colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  - Each color is used only once.
  - In any rug with white, two other colors are used.
  - In any rug with olive, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  - There are two solid rugs.
  
Solution:
  - If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be three multicolored rugs.
  - In any rug with white, two other colors are used. Thus, the two solid rugs cannot contain white.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, so if forest is used in a solid rug, then turquoise cannot be used in any of the three multicolored rugs. Similarly, if turquoise is used in a solid rug, then forest cannot be used in any of the three multicolored rugs.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, so if peach is used in a solid rug, then turquoise cannot be used in any of the three multicolored rugs. Similarly, if turquoise is used in a solid rug, then peach cannot be used in any of the three multicolored rugs.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, so if peach is used in a solid rug, then yellow cannot be used in any of the three multicolored rugs. Similarly, if yellow is used in a solid rug, then peach cannot be used in any of the three multicolored rugs.
  - Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and peach (A), forest and yellow (B), peach and turquoise (C), or peach and yellow (D).
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  We need to find two colors that cannot be used in the two solid rugs.
  Two colors that cannot be used in the same rug if they appear together in any of the following pairs: 
    - {forest, turquoise}
    - {peach, turquoise}
    - {peach, yellow}
  If white is used, two other colors are also used in the same rug.
  If olive is used, peach is also used in the same rug.
  There are six colors to choose from, and only five colors are used to weave the rugs.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If we have exactly two solid rugs, then we have three multicolored rugs. 
  Let's assume that one solid rug is peach. Then, according to the rule, olive must be used in the same rug. 
  There are only three colors left to use in the other solid rug. 
  If we use forest or yellow in the other solid rug, then we cannot use them in any of the multicolored rugs because each color is used in only one rug. 
  Therefore, we must use white in the other solid rug. 
  Now, we have forest, turquoise, and yellow left to use in the multicolored rugs. 
  We cannot use forest and turquoise together in the same rug, so we must use them in different rugs. 
  Similarly, we cannot use peach and turquoise or peach and yellow together in the same rug, so we must use them in different rugs. 
  This leaves us with only one possible combination of colors for the multicolored rugs: forest, turquoise, and yellow. 
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and peach, forest and yellow, peach and turquoise, or peach and yellow. 
  The only remaining option is turquoise and yellow, which is not listed as a choice. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  We need to find two colors that cannot be used in solid rugs.
  In a solid rug, only one color is used.
  We know that there are six colors, and exactly five of them will be used.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis:
  If there are two solid rugs, then there must be three multicolored rugs.
  Let's consider each option and see if it is possible to have two solid rugs with those colors:
  A: If forest and peach cannot be used in solid rugs, it means that they must be used in multicolored rugs. However, if they are used in the same multicolored rug, then we cannot use olive, white, and turquoise in any rug. Therefore, it is not possible to have two solid rugs without using forest and peach in them.
  B: If forest and yellow cannot be used in solid rugs, it means that they must be used in multicolored rugs. However, if they are used in the same multicolored rug, then we cannot use olive, white, and turquoise in any rug. Therefore, it is not possible to have two solid rugs without using forest and yellow in them.
  C: If peach and turquoise cannot be used in solid rugs, it means that they must be used in multicolored rugs. However, if they are used in the same multicolored rug, then we cannot use olive, white, and forest in any rug. Therefore, it is possible to have two solid rugs without using peach and turquoise in them.
  D: If peach and yellow cannot be used in solid rugs, it means that they must be used in multicolored rugs. However, if they are used in the same multicolored rug, then we cannot use olive, white, and forest in any rug. Therefore, it is possible to have two solid rugs without using peach and yellow in them.
  E: If turquoise and yellow cannot be used in solid rugs, it means that they must be used in multicolored rugs. However, if they are used in the same multicolored rug, then we cannot use olive, white, and forest in any rug. Therefore, it is possible to have two solid rugs without using turquoise and yellow in them.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The question asks for a combination of two colors that cannot be used for two solid rugs.
  A: There are no rules that prevent the use of forest and peach together in a solid rug.
  B: There are no rules that prevent the use of forest and yellow together in a solid rug.
  C: There are no rules that prevent the use of peach and turquoise together in a solid rug.
  D: If peach is used in a solid rug, then it cannot be used with yellow in the same rug. Therefore, this combination cannot be used for two solid rugs.
  E: There are no rules that prevent the use of turquoise and yellow together in a solid rug.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are six colors of thread available to weave the rugs: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  Exactly two of the three rugs will be solid.
  
Analysis:
  We need to determine which two colors cannot be used in solid rugs.
  We know that exactly two of the three rugs will be solid, so we need to consider all possible combinations of two solid rugs.
  If one of the solid rugs uses forest, it must be combined with two other colors in the same rug. This means that the other solid rug cannot use peach, since peach is already paired with olive. Therefore, (A) forest and peach cannot be used in solid rugs.
  If one of the solid rugs uses yellow, it cannot be paired with peach. Therefore, (D) peach and yellow cannot be used in solid rugs.
  If one of the solid rugs uses turquoise, it cannot be paired with forest. Therefore, (B) forest and yellow cannot be used in solid rugs.
  This leaves us with (C) peach and turquoise and (E) turquoise and yellow as possible combinations for solid rugs.

Action: Answer("B")

  There are 6 colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly 5 colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  White can only be used with two other colors in a rug.
  Olive must be used with peach in a rug.
  Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  There are exactly two solid rugs.
  
  If a rug is solid, then it is woven in a single color. 
  Therefore, a solid rug cannot contain more than one color.
  
Analysis: 
  Since there are exactly two solid rugs, each of those rugs can only have one color. 
  We need to eliminate the answer choices that include two colors that cannot be used together in a solid rug.
  The colors that cannot be used together in a solid rug are:
    - Forest and Turquoise
    - Peach and Turquoise
    - Peach and Yellow
    
Elimination:
  A: Forest and Peach -> Both colors cannot be used together in a solid rug. Eliminate.
  B: Forest and Yellow -> Forest can be used in a solid rug, but Yellow cannot be used in a solid rug. Eliminate.
  C: Peach and Turquoise -> Both colors cannot be used together in a solid rug. Eliminate.
  D: Peach and Yellow -> Both colors cannot be used together in a solid rug. Eliminate.
  E: Turquoise and Yellow -> Turquoise can be used in a solid rug, but Yellow cannot be used in a solid rug. Eliminate.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are six colors of thread available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Five colors will be used to weave the three rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find two colors that cannot be used together in two solid rugs.
  The rules that are relevant to this question are:
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug
  - Any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
Action: Answer("A") 

Explanation: 
  Let's assume that forest and peach are used in two solid rugs. According to the rules, olive must be used with peach, which means that olive cannot be used in any other rug. Turquoise cannot be used with forest, which means that turquoise must be used with olive and peach. However, this violates the rule that peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, forest and peach cannot be used in two solid rugs.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: Verma could be the project leader if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members and one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then she must be one of the three project members. 
  So, we can eliminate options A, B, and C because they do not include Verma as a project member.
  If Smith is not selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. This means that Wells cannot be selected because neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is a project member.
  If Xue is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be the project leader because they can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  So, the only option that remains is E, which satisfies all the constraints and allows Verma to be the project leader.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find a scenario where Verma can be the project leader. Since Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is also a project member, and there can only be three members, that means Wells is not selected. According to the constraints, if Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, they must also be the project leader. Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be selected. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be, which means Smith and Taylor are both selected. This leaves Xue as the only remaining worker. Since Verma can be the project leader, we know that Verma is not a project member. Because there are three project members, and Wells, Quinn/Ruiz, and Verma are not selected, that means Smith, Taylor, and Xue are the project members. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project leader must be one of the three project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Analysis:
  If Verma is to be the project leader, that means Verma must be one of the three project members.
  If Wells is a project member, Verma cannot be a project member. Therefore, Wells cannot be selected.
  If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which means Taylor cannot be a project member. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, there is no way to ensure that Taylor is selected. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, there is no way to ensure that Quinn or Ruiz is selected to be the project leader. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Ruiz can be a project member and the project leader. Therefore, this is the possible option.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have 3 members and 1 leader.
  Quinn and Ruiz can only be members if they lead the project.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis: 
  If Verma is the project leader, then the other two members must be selected from the following four workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, and Taylor. 
  Quinn and Ruiz can only be members if they lead the project, so they cannot be members if Verma is the leader. 
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be, but if Taylor is a member, then Wells cannot be. So, if Verma is the leader, then neither Smith nor Taylor nor Wells can be members. 
  Therefore, the only possible scenario in which Verma could be the project leader is if Smith, Taylor, and Wells are not selected, which corresponds to choice (C).

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three of the seven workers will be selected.
  - Exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  - If Verma is the project leader, she cannot be a project member, so only two other workers can be project members.
  - If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, so Wells cannot be a project member if Verma is the project leader.
  - If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be, so neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member if Verma is the project leader.
  - If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, and the other one can be a project member, leaving only one more spot for a project member.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly 3 of the 7 workers will be selected for the special project, and exactly one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find the scenario in which Verma could be the project leader, given the constraints.
  If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, Verma cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is not selected, Taylor cannot be a project member. Therefore, Smith must be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be a project member. Therefore, Taylor is a project member.
  If Quinn or Ruiz are not selected, they cannot be a project member or the project leader. Therefore, Quinn or Ruiz must be selected as the project leader.
  This leaves us with the following possibilities for the three project members: {Quinn, Smith, Taylor}, {Ruiz, Smith, Taylor}, or {Quinn, Ruiz, Smith}.
  In order for Verma to be the project leader, Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member. Therefore, {Quinn, Smith, Taylor} and {Ruiz, Smith, Taylor} are not possible scenarios, and {Quinn, Ruiz, Smith} is the only possible scenario. 
  Therefore, if neither Smith nor Xue is selected, Verma could be the project leader.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of them will be the project leader. 
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  - If Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. So, Wells cannot be a project member.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. So, if Verma is the project leader, Smith cannot be a project member because Taylor must be a project member if Smith is a project member. Therefore, Smith cannot be a project member.
  - We need to select three workers out of the remaining four: Quinn, Ruiz, Taylor, and Xue.

A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. --> In this case, Taylor and Xue will be selected as project members. But, as we have seen earlier, Verma cannot be the project leader if Smith is not a project member. So, this option is not possible.
B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. --> In this case, Quinn and Xue will be selected as project members. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project and Ruiz is not selected, Quinn must be the project leader. So, Verma cannot be the project leader. This option is not possible.
C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. --> In this case, Quinn and Xue will be selected as project members. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project and neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, Quinn must be the project leader. So, Verma cannot be the project leader. This option is not possible.
D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. --> In this case, Quinn and Taylor will be selected as project members. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project and neither Ruiz nor Smith is selected, Quinn must be the project leader. So, Verma can be a project member and the project leader. This option is possible.
E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. --> In this case, Quinn and Ruiz will be selected as project members. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project and neither Wells nor Verma can be a project member, Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. So, Verma cannot be the project leader. This option is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Analysis:
  To determine if Verma could be the project leader, we need to consider the constraints given for the selection of team members.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, neither Wells nor Ruiz can be the project member. This means that Smith and Taylor must be the other two project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Ruiz must be one of the project members. This means that Quinn cannot be a project member.
  So, the only remaining worker who can be the third project member is Xue.
  Therefore, the only option that allows Verma to be the project leader is if neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Seven workers are being considered for a special project, and exactly three of them will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of the project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, either Wells and Verma are not selected, or Wells is the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member. Therefore, either Smith and Taylor are both selected, or neither is selected.
  If Verma is the project leader, then exactly two of the following workers must be selected: Smith, Taylor, and Wells.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The project will have 3 members, and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a member if they are the leader.
  If Smith is a member, Taylor must also be a member.
  If Wells is a member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members.

Solution:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be members.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members.
  Therefore, Smith, Taylor, and Xue must be the members. (Since if either Ruiz or Quinn were members, then they would have to be the leader, which would violate the constraint that Verma is the leader.)
  This means that Smith and Taylor must be members, and Xue must be the third member and Verma must be the leader.
  Therefore, the answer is (D) Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.

Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Analysis:
  We can use the rules to eliminate some of the options.
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so option A cannot be true.
  We know that K cannot be shown in the morning, so option A cannot be true.
  We know that L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon or in the evening. This eliminates option D.
  Since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, option E is not possible. This leaves us with option B and C.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses in total, two in the morning, three in the afternoon, and two in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  Since J must be shown in the evening, and there are only two houses to be shown in the evening, J must be either the sixth or seventh house to be shown. 
  Since K cannot be shown in the morning, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. 
  Since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, L cannot be shown in the morning. 
  Therefore, K and L must be shown in the afternoon, and M must be shown in the evening.
  So, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show 7 houses during a single day.
  The houses will be shown in the following order: J, K, L, M, N, O, P.
  The first and second houses will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

  A: K cannot be shown in the evening.
  B: L can be shown in the afternoon, but it is not a must.
  C: L can be shown in the evening, but it is not a must.
  D: M cannot be shown in the morning.
  E: M must be shown in the afternoon because L must be shown after K and before M, and K cannot be shown in the afternoon. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:

  The realtor will show seven houses to a prospective buyer in a single day, with specific houses shown in the morning, afternoon, and evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  From the rules, we know that J will be shown in the evening, and K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. Also, L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L cannot be shown in the morning, and it must be shown in the afternoon or evening. Since J is shown in the evening, and L must be shown after K and before M, then K, L, and M must be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, the answer is B or C.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Elimination:
  A: K must be shown in the morning or in the afternoon, but not in the evening since J is already scheduled to be shown in the evening. So, A cannot be true.
  B: L must be shown after K and before M, and both K and M are scheduled to be shown in the morning or in the afternoon. Therefore, it is possible for L to be shown in the afternoon. So, B can be true.
  C: J must be shown in the evening and L must be shown after K and before M. Therefore, L cannot be shown in the evening. So, C cannot be true.
  D: M must be shown after L and L cannot be shown in the evening. Therefore, M cannot be shown in the morning. So, D cannot be true.
  E: M must be shown after L and L must be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, M must be shown in the afternoon. So, E can be true.

  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  J is shown in the evening, so J cannot be the first or second house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown after K and before M, so L cannot be the third or fifth house to be shown.
  From the rules, we do not know the exact order of K, L, and M but we know that K and L will be shown in the afternoon or evening, and L must be shown before M.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  Since L must be shown before M, and L cannot be shown in the third or fifth house, L must be shown in the fourth house. Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. From the rules, we do not know the exact order of K, L, and M, but we know that M must be shown after L, so M must be shown in the afternoon after L is shown. Therefore, the correct answer is E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show 7 houses during a single day.
  The first and second houses are in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses are in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses are in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown between K and M.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we know that J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning. So, K will be shown either in the afternoon or in the evening. Also, L must be shown between K and M, which means K should be shown before L and M should be shown after L. Therefore, we can deduce that:
  - A cannot be true because K cannot be shown in the morning.
  - B cannot be true because L must be shown between K and M.
  - C must be true because L must be shown between K and M and J must be shown in the evening.
  - D cannot be true because M should be shown after L, which means in the afternoon or evening.
  - E must be true because M should be shown after L, which means in the afternoon or evening.

  The realtor will show seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, O, and P—during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be the first or second house shown. Therefore, J must be the sixth or seventh house shown. 
  We also know that K cannot be shown in the morning. So, K must be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown. 
  We also know that L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. So, K must be shown before L, and M must be shown after L. 
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be: 
  Morning: A, B 
  Afternoon: C, D, E 
  Evening: J, F or G 
  Since L must be shown after K and before M, L must be shown in the afternoon. 
  So, the answer is B: L is shown in the afternoon.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. J is shown in the evening.
  2. K cannot be shown in the morning.
  3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  4. The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  5. The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  
Analysis:
- J is shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, J and K cannot be the first and second houses shown in the morning.
- L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, K must be shown before L and M must be shown after L.
- The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, K, L, and M must be among these three houses.
- The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. Therefore, N, O, and P must be among these two houses.

Action: Answer("E")  
The only remaining option is that M is shown in the afternoon. Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses to a prospective buyer.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Analysis:
  According to the rules, J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. 
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L cannot be shown in the morning or evening, and it must be shown in the afternoon.
  So, L is shown in the afternoon.
  And, M is shown after L, and therefore, M is shown in the afternoon or evening.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned as ambassador to any country.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned as ambassador to one of the other countries.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Elimination:
  A: There is no information to support this statement.
  B: There is no information to support this statement.
  C: There is no information to support this statement.
  D: There is no information to support this statement.
  E: There is no information to support this statement.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship. Also, if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship. However, if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship, which means that the only option left for Jaramillo, Novetzke, and Ong is Venezuela, Zambia, and Yemen respectively. Since Landon is not assigned to Zambia, it must be true that Jaramillo is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Thus, the correct answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, and Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships, then either Jaramillo or Ong must be assigned to the remaining ambassadorship to satisfy the constraint that each country must have an ambassador. Since Jaramillo can only be assigned as ambassador if Kayne is also assigned an ambassadorship, and Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. Therefore, Jaramillo is not assigned to any ambassadorship, so the correct answer is D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Kayne or Novetzke (but not both) is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then it must be true that Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. This is because if Jaramillo is assigned to any ambassadorship, Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship. Since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, it means Jaramillo must be assigned to Venezuela. 

Therefore, the answer is A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then if Jaramillo is assigned to any ambassadorship, he must be assigned to Venezuela.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Landon is assigned to any ambassadorship, he must be assigned to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela as per the first constraint.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship as per the first constraint.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela as per the third constraint.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia as per the fourth constraint.
  We don't have any information about the assignment of Jaramillo.
  We don't have any information about the assignment of Ong.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship. So, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia as per the fourth constraint. Therefore, B is the correct answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia.
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela since Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to different countries. Thus, the only option left for Jaramillo is to be assigned to Zambia or Yemen. However, we do not know if Landon will also be assigned to Zambia or if Ong will be assigned to one of the remaining countries. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about Landon or Ong. The only certain statement is that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.

Action: 
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships, because they cannot both be assigned. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned as an ambassador, so Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia. Therefore, the only choice that must be true is B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that Jaramillo can only be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. However, it is not required that Jaramillo be assigned to an ambassadorship in this scenario. Therefore, we cannot say for sure that Jaramillo is assigned or not assigned to an ambassadorship. Thus, choice D is the most likely option.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one of the countries, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the countries.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Analysis:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to Yemen. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the countries. But if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. Therefore, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship. 
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. But we don't know if Landon is assigned as an ambassador, so we cannot say for sure that Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. But we know that Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, so Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. Therefore, Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band: guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist.
  Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  To determine who cannot perform the third solo, we need to determine who must perform the third solo. From the given restrictions, we know that the percussionist must perform a solo before the keyboard player does, and the keyboard player must perform a solo after the violinist does. The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform the first, second, or third solo. The saxophonist must perform a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform the fifth or sixth solo. 
  The only musician who is not accounted for is the trumpeter. Since the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does, but the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo, we can conclude that the trumpeter must perform the third solo. Therefore, the answer is not the trumpeter.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

To determine who performs the third solo, we can start with the options that fit the given restrictions:
- The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, and the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter.
- Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform before the percussionist, which means the percussionist performs third and the saxophonist performs fourth.
- The guitarist does not perform fourth, so he must perform fifth or sixth.
- The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so he must perform first or second.
- That leaves the trumpeter and the violinist to perform the remaining two solos, which can be in any order.

Option A: The guitarist cannot perform third, which is consistent with the given restrictions.
Option B: The keyboard player can perform second, which is consistent with the given restrictions.
Option C: The saxophonist performs fourth, which is consistent with the given restrictions.
Option D: The trumpeter can perform either the first or the sixth solo, which is consistent with the given restrictions.
Option E: The violinist can perform either the first or the sixth solo, which is consistent with the given restrictions.

Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  A six-member band performs solos during a concert.
  Each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  Since there are six members, each must perform exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist's solo must be the first, second, third, or fifth.
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the percussionist's solo must be the first, second, or third.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so the keyboard player's solo must be the second or third.
  The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. This means that the saxophonist's solo must be the fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  Therefore, the only member who could not perform the third solo is the violinist, because the keyboard player's solo must be after the violinist's solo.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Each member of the six-member band performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: 
  Based on the given restrictions, we know that the guitarist is not performing the fourth solo, so they must perform either the first, second, or third solo. The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, who performs after the violinist and before the guitarist. The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the only option for the third solo is the trumpet player since both the percussionist and the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo. 
  Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Logic:
  - The order of the solos is: percussionist, trumpeter/saxophonist, violinist, keyboard player, guitarist.
  - If the guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, then he must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  - If the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, then he must perform either the first or second solo.
  - If the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, then he must perform either the third or fourth solo.
  - If the saxophonist performs after the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both, then he must perform either the second or fifth solo.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logic:
- The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform either the second solo or the third solo. 
- The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform either the first solo, the second solo, or the third solo.
- The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the first solo or the second solo.

Using the above logic, we can eliminate the following options:
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
- The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

This leaves us with the following possibilities for who performs the third solo:
- The percussionist performs the first solo, the saxophonist performs the second solo, and the keyboard player performs the third solo.
- The percussionist performs the second solo, the saxophonist performs the third solo, and the keyboard player performs the first solo.

Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or D, but E: violinist. The violinist is not mentioned in the logic used to determine who performs the third solo. 

Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist, since the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the keyboard player, since the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the saxophonist, since the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, if the saxophonist performed the third solo, either the percussionist or the trumpeter would have to perform their solo after the saxophonist, which is not allowed by the rules.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the trumpeter, since the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, if the trumpeter performed the third solo, the saxophonist would have to perform their solo after the percussionist, which is not allowed by the rules.
  - Therefore, the only option left is the violinist.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the following logical order:
  1. The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  2. The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  3. The saxophonist performs after the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
If the saxophonist performs third, then the percussionist must perform first, and the keyboard player must perform second. But this means that the keyboard player performs before the violinist, which violates the second restriction. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform third.

Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the sixth audition?
Choices:
  A: Kammer's audition
  B: Lugo's audition
  C: Trillo's audition
  D: Waite's audition
  E: Zinn's audition
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the auditions is: Waite, [not recorded], Kammer (recorded), Trillo, Yoshida, Zinn (recorded).
  A: Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  B: Lugo's audition is one of the recorded auditions and must take place before the last audition, so Lugo's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  C: Trillo's audition must take place after Kammer's audition, so Trillo's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  D: Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  E: Zinn's audition is the last audition and is one of the recorded auditions, so Zinn's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analysis:
  Since the fifth audition must be recorded, it can only be Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, it cannot be Trillo's audition.
  Since Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, Waite's audition must be first or second.
  Since Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, Kammer's audition must be first or second.
  Since Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, Zinn's audition must be fourth or earlier.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Choice C, Trillo's audition, could be the sixth audition.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we can deduce that Kammer's audition has to be the first audition since it is recorded. The second audition must be Lugo's since it is also recorded. The fourth audition cannot be recorded so it must be either Trillo's, Waite's, Yoshida's or Zinn's. The fifth audition must be recorded and so it must be either Trillo's, Yoshida's or Zinn's. Since Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, we can deduce that Waite's audition must be the third audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition cannot be the sixth one. 

Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, Trillo's audition could be the sixth audition.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The auditions will be held in a single day.
  Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analysis: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded and the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fourth audition must be one of the four non-recorded auditions that take place before the fifth audition. Since Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, Waite's audition must be the first, second, or third audition. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be the first, second, or third audition as well. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be the fourth or earlier audition. Therefore, the sixth audition must be Trillo's audition or Lugo's audition.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Using these conditions, we can determine the order of the auditions:
1. Waite
2. Kammer
3. Trillo
4. Zinn
5. Yoshida
6. Lugo or None of the Above

Option A is incorrect because Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
Option B is incorrect because Lugo's audition is already one of the recorded auditions.
Option C is incorrect because the fourth audition cannot be recorded, and Trillo is the third audition.
Option D is incorrect because Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
Option E is also incorrect because Zinn's audition is already the fourth audition.

Therefore, the correct answer is None of the Above, meaning we cannot determine which audition will be the sixth one based on the given conditions.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded.
  - The other four auditions will not be recorded.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the fifth audition must be recorded and Kammer's and Lugo's auditions are recorded, the fifth audition cannot be Kammer's or Lugo's.
  - Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, the fourth audition cannot be Trillo's.
  - Since Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, Waite's audition cannot be the fifth audition. Therefore, Waite's audition must be the first, second, or third audition.
  - Since Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, Kammer's audition must be the first, second, or third audition, and Trillo's audition must be the fourth, fifth, or sixth audition.
  - Since Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, Zinn's audition must be the first, second, or third audition, and Yoshida's audition must be the fourth, fifth, or sixth audition.
  - Therefore, the possible orders of the auditions are:
    1. Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
    2. Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Yoshida, Lugo
    3. Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida
    4. Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Lugo, Yoshida, Trillo
    5. Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Yoshida, Lugo, Trillo
    6. Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Yoshida, Trillo, Lugo
  - Therefore, the sixth audition could be Trillo's audition.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
  The order of the auditions will be as follows: 
  Waite > Kammer > Trillo > [not recorded] > Lugo > Yoshida > Zinn
  
  A: Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, Kammer cannot be the sixth audition.
  B: Lugo's audition must be the fifth audition, so it cannot be the sixth audition.
  C: Trillo's audition must take place after Kammer's audition, so it cannot be the sixth audition.
  D: Waite's audition is scheduled to be the first or second audition, so it cannot be the sixth audition.
  E: Zinn's audition is scheduled to be the last audition, so it could be the sixth audition.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Elimination:
  From the conditions given, it is clear that Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition are the first two auditions, and the fifth audition must be recorded. 
  From the given options, Waite's audition cannot be the sixth audition because it must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. 
  Trillo's audition cannot be the sixth audition because it must take place after Kammer's audition. 
  Zinn's audition cannot be the sixth audition because it must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. 
  Therefore, the only option that remains is Lugo's audition. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
  Since the fifth audition must be recorded, the options for the fifth audition are Kammer and Lugo. Therefore, the fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the options are Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be the first, second, or third audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be the first, second, third, or fourth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth audition.
  
  From these conditions, we can determine that Trillo's audition must be the sixth and final audition.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  We know that the fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fourth audition must be either Waite, Kammer, Trillo, or Zinn. However, we also know that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, which means Waite cannot be the fourth audition. Therefore, the fourth audition must be either Kammer, Trillo, or Zinn. We also know that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, which means Kammer cannot be the sixth audition. We also know that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, which means Zinn cannot be the sixth audition. Therefore, the sixth audition must be either Lugo or Trillo.

Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?

  B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs are to appear in three different sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
  - Two photographs per section.
  - The photographs were taken by three different photographers (Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue).
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  - One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes. This is because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Since there is at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes, and each section has exactly two photographs, Fuentes must have exactly one photograph in the Lifestyle section. This means that Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section, and since Gagnon and Hue each have one photograph in the Lifestyle section, neither of them can have a photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - A total of 6 different photographs are to appear, exactly 2 photographs per section.
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then it is possible that both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. However, it is not required that both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, so option A is not necessarily true. It is also not required that both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, so option C is not necessarily true. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so option E is not true. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, but we don't know how many photographs Fuentes has in the Sports section, so option D is not necessarily true. Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon (option B).
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
    - There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes.
    - There must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes.
    - There cannot be any photograph by Gagnon in the Sports section because none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
    - The number of Fuentes' photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section.
    
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The newspaper has three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six different photographs in total, with exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then it means that the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes. This satisfies the condition that each photographer must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section. Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, it follows that the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must also be by a photographer who has a photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, one of the photographs in the Metro section must be by Gagnon. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, it follows that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have two photographs in the Lifestyle section, and two photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon, which is answer choice B.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - 6 different photographs are to appear, exactly 2 per section in 3 sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer must have at least 1 but no more than 3 photographs.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes cannot have any photographs in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, Fuentes must have both photographs in the Sports section, and since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, Hue must also have both photographs in the Lifestyle section. This means that Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Lifestyle section, so both photographs in the Metro section must be by Gagnon. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Answer: B.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, Sports) has to have exactly two photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then it means that Fuentes has to have two photographs in Sports section to balance the number with Hue's photographs in Lifestyle section. Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in Sports section, and each section can only have two photographs, it follows that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  - One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.

Action: Answer("B") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. If Fuentes has only one photograph in the Metro section, then it must be in the same section as Gagnon's photograph, which means that Gagnon will have no photographs in the Sports section. This contradicts the given condition that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, Fuentes must have exactly two photographs in the Metro section. This means that there cannot be two photographs by Gagnon in the Metro section (because only one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon), so there must be exactly one photograph in the Metro section by Gagnon. Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section must have exactly two photographs.
  - Each photographer must have at least one photograph but no more than three in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - Gagnon's photographs cannot be in the Sports section.
  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, we can deduce that the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes or Hue. Additionally, since Hue has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, we know that Fuentes must have a photograph in the Sports section.

Analysis:
  A: There is no information about Fuentes having exactly one photograph in the Metro section.
  B: There is no information about Gagnon having exactly one photograph in the Metro section.
  C: Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, so this is not possible.
  D: We know that Fuentes must have a photograph in the Sports section, but we do not know if it is the only one.
  E: We know that Fuentes must have a photograph in the Sports section, but we do not know if Hue has any photographs in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- There are 6 photographs in total, 2 in each section of Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
- There are 3 photographers, Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs in total.
- At least one photograph in Lifestyle is by a photographer who has at least one photo in Metro.
- The number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle is the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports.
- Gagnon has no photographs in Sports.

If one photograph in Lifestyle is by Gagnon and one is by Hue:
- Gagnon has no photographs in Sports, so neither does Hue.
- Fuentes must have at least one photograph in Sports to match the number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle.
- Therefore, Fuentes has either 1 or 2 photographs in Sports.
- Fuentes cannot have all 3 photos in Sports because Gagnon has to have at least one photo in Lifestyle and Gagnon has no photos in Sports.
- Therefore, Fuentes has 1 photo in Sports and Hue has 1 photo in Lifestyle.

Choices:
A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. - We don't have enough information to determine this, so it's not a must be true statement.
B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. - We don't have enough information to determine this, so it's not a must be true statement.
C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - We don't have enough information to determine this, so it's not a must be true statement.
D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - We know Fuentes has 1 photo in Sports, so Hue can only have 1 photo in Lifestyle. Therefore, this statement must be true.
E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - We know Fuentes has 1 photo in Sports, so Hue cannot have both photos in Sports. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Three types of cookies are made - oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. Three batches of each type of cookie are made each week.
  3. Each batch is made from start to finish on a single day.
  4. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  5. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  6. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  7. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Action: Answer("B")  

Explanation: 
If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the three batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. This leaves only one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies to be made on Tuesday and Thursday, and the remaining batch of oatmeal cookies to be made on Friday. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies must be made on Friday. So, B is the answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge:

  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday or Thursday.
  
  A: If exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday. Thus, A is not necessarily true.
  B: If exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday, then the second batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday. Thus, B is not necessarily true.
  C: If at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday. Thus, C is not true.
  D: If at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday, then the second batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday. Thus, D is not necessarily true.
  E: There are no restrictions on the number of batches of cookies made on Monday or Tuesday. Thus, E is not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies - oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then:
  - The first batch of cookies on Monday can be either oatmeal, peanut butter, or sugar cookies.
  - Depending on the first batch on Monday, the second batch of oatmeal or peanut butter cookies will be made on either Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies will be made on Thursday.
  - The third batch of cookies will be made on either Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday, depending on the previous batches.

Solution:
  Based on the analysis, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the only possible day to make three batches of cookies is Friday. Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. 
  Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. 
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible schedules for the week: 
  1. oatmeal on Monday, peanut butter and sugar on Tuesday, peanut butter and sugar on Thursday, and oatmeal on Friday. 
  2. peanut butter and sugar on Monday, oatmeal on Tuesday, oatmeal on Thursday, and peanut butter and sugar on Friday.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices C and D because they require at least two batches of cookies on Monday or Thursday, respectively. 
  We can also eliminate choice E because we have no information regarding the number of batches made on Monday or Tuesday. 
  Now, we have to choose between A and B. Both choices are possible, depending on the exact schedule of the batches. 
  
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.

  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal or peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Tuesday. This means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday. Then, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday because it cannot be made on Wednesday. If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday and the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday. This means that two batches of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and one batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday or Thursday. But, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, so the second batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Wednesday. Therefore, the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday. This means that two batches of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and one batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. 
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: 
If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the three batches of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies were made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies must be made on Tuesday, which means fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday. 
Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, it means that there are only two days left to complete the batches of cookies for the week: Thursday and Friday. 

Analysis:
  - Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, we know that there must be at least one batch of cookies made on Thursday and one batch of cookies made on Friday.
  - We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, which means that there can be no other batches of sugar cookies made on Friday. 
  - Therefore, the only way to make sure that all the batches are completed is to make one batch of each kind of cookie on Friday.
  - This means that exactly two batches of cookies must be made on Tuesday, one of which is the second batch of oatmeal cookies.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  There are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week.
  Each batch is made on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  Let's consider the possible scenarios based on the given conditions:
  1. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Monday (because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies), and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday. This means that there are no batches of cookies made on Wednesday, and the remaining batches are made on Thursday and Friday.
  2. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday (because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day), and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday. This means that there are no batches of cookies made on Thursday, and the remaining batches are made on Friday and Monday.
  3. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday (because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day), and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. This means that there are no batches of cookies made on Tuesday, and the remaining batches are made on Wednesday and Friday.
  
Solution:
  The question states that no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday. This means that scenario 1 is the only possible scenario. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. Answer: B.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The bakery makes three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the following must be true: 
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, as the second batch is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, as the second batch is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies.
  - The first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday, as the second batch is made on Thursday.
  - Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the third batch of each type of cookie must be made on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  - Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.

  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Action: Answer("D") 

If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, it means that the three batches of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies must have been made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday. However, we know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so it is not possible for all three types of cookies to be made on Thursday. Therefore, we must conclude that at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday. Thus, the correct answer is D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A teacher will assign each of five students—Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga—to exactly one of two research teams, the green team and the red team. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga
  2. Two research teams: green team and red team
  3. One team has two members, and the other has three members.
  4. One facilitator per team.
  5. Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
  6. Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  7. Kelly is not a facilitator.
  8. Olga is a facilitator.

To determine the correct answer, we can eliminate options that are not necessarily true based on the given information.

Eliminate A: Juana could be assigned to the red team, but she could also be assigned to the green team.

Eliminate B: Lateefah is assigned to the green team, but there is no information about whether or not she is a facilitator.

Eliminate C: Olga is assigned to the green team as a facilitator, but there is no information about the assignment of the other students.

Eliminate D: There is no information about whether or not Mei is a facilitator.

Action: Answer("E") 
The only remaining option is E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator. We know that Kelly is not a facilitator, and Olga is already designated as a facilitator, so Juana cannot be a facilitator. Therefore, neither Juana nor Kelly can be a facilitator.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
  There are only two teams, one with two members and one with three members.
  
  A: There is not enough information to determine if Juana is assigned to the red team or not.
  B: Lateefah is assigned to the green team, but there is no information to determine if she is a facilitator or not.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team as a facilitator.
  D: There are only two facilitators, one for each team, and Olga is already assigned as a facilitator. Therefore, either Juana or Mei will be the other facilitator and this statement must be true.
  E: Olga is already assigned as a facilitator, so Kelly cannot be a facilitator. There are only two facilitators, so Juana cannot be a facilitator either. Therefore, this statement must be true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  The teams must have two and three members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Reasoning:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, there must be two other members in that team, one of which must be a facilitator, which cannot be Kelly. 
  Olga is assigned to the other team which has three members, with one member being a facilitator, which cannot be Kelly. 
  Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the red team, which has two members, and Mei must be assigned to the green team. 

A: Juana is assigned to the red team. (True)
B: Lateefah is a facilitator. (False)
C: Olga is assigned to the green team. (True)
D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. (True)
E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator. (True)

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team has 3 members and the red team has 2 members.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be on the team with 3 members, which is the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be on the red team.
  Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Mei must be the other facilitator.
  Therefore, neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  There are two research teams: the green team and the red team.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Since Olga is a facilitator, she cannot be on the same team as Lateefah. Therefore, Olga is on the red team, and Juana is on the green team. Mei is the only student left to be on the red team. Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Kelly is on the green team. Therefore, Lateefah and Olga are facilitators, and Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  2. There are two teams: the green team and the red team.
  3. One team has two members, and the other has three members.
  4. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  5. Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  6. Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  7. Kelly is not a facilitator.
  8. Olga is a facilitator.
  
Thinking Process: 
  From 5, Juana is assigned to the red team. From 6, Lateefah is assigned to the green team. From 7, Kelly is not a facilitator. From 8, Olga is a facilitator. Therefore, Mei is the other member of the red team. Since there must be one more facilitator, it must be Mei or Juana. This means that Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams, one with two members and one with three members.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have three members and the red team must have two members. 
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be on the green team with Lateefah and one other person.
  Juana cannot be on the green team, so she must be on the red team with Mei.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so she cannot be on the same team as Olga.
  
A: Juana is assigned to the red team. (True)
B: Lateefah is a facilitator. (False)
C: Olga is assigned to the green team. (True)
D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. (True)
E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator. (True)

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams, one with two members and one with three members.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, and there are only two teams, Lateefah must be on the same team as Olga, who is a facilitator. Therefore, the green team has three members, and the red team has two members. 
  Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana must be on the red team. 
  Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Mei must be the facilitator on the red team. 
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are 5 students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  - There are 2 teams: the green team and the red team.
  - One team has 2 members, and the other has 3 members.
  - One member of each team is a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
  
Analysis:
  - There are two possible assignments for the teams: (1) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, Mei; Red team: Juana, Kelly. (2) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, Juana; Red team: Kelly, Mei.
  - From the given conditions, we know that Lateefah is assigned to the green team and Olga is a facilitator. Therefore, Olga must be assigned to the green team. 
  - Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator, so Mei must be the facilitator of the red team.
  
Action: Answer("D") - Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  There are two research teams: the green team and the red team.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses to a prospective buyer, two in the morning, three in the afternoon, and two in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  Since J must be shown in the evening, J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon, so J will be the last house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Since K cannot be shown in the morning, L must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  According to the given rules, J must be shown in the evening, and L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Since J is shown last, L must be shown at some time before M is shown. Therefore, K must be shown before L and M. So, K is shown in the afternoon and L is shown in the afternoon or evening. Since J is shown last, L must be shown at some time after J is shown. Thus, the correct answer is B. 
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day: J, K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  The first two houses will be shown in the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon, and the sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  A: If K is shown after J, then J must be shown in the morning, which contradicts the given rule that J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If L is shown after J, then J must be shown in the morning, which again contradicts the given rule that J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: P can be shown in the morning or afternoon, and then J can be shown in the evening. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: The question does not provide any information about the order of N and O. Therefore, D cannot be determined to be true or false.
  E: If both N and P are shown after K, then K must be shown in the morning or afternoon, which contradicts the given rule that K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, E is not true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Analysis:
  A: If K is shown at some time after J is shown, then J must be shown in the morning, which is not possible since J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, A is false.
  B: If L is shown at some time after J is shown, then J must be shown in the morning, which is not possible since J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, B is false.
  C: P can be shown at some time after J is shown, since P is not restricted by any rule. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: Both N and O cannot be shown at some time after M is shown, since there are only two houses left to be shown (N and P) and they must be shown in the evening. Therefore, D is false.
  E: Both N and P can be shown at some time after K is shown, since there are no restrictions on N and P. Therefore, E could be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The realtor will show 7 houses in total, with a specific order for showing them.
  - J must be shown in the evening, so it will be either the 6th or 7th house to be shown.
  - K cannot be shown in the morning, so it will be either the 3rd, 4th, or 5th house to be shown.
  - L must be shown after K and before M, so it will be either the 4th or 5th house to be shown.
  
Analysis:
  - Option A: K is shown after J, but K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - Option B: L is shown after J, but J must be shown in the evening and L must be shown after K and before M. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - Option C: P is shown after J, and J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, this option is possible.
  - Option D: Both N and O are shown after M, but there is no information about N and O's position among the seven houses to be shown. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - Option E: Both N and P are shown after K, and K can be shown in the afternoon or evening. Therefore, this option is possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show 7 houses to a prospective buyer during a single day, with specific time slots for each house. 
  J must be shown in the evening, which means it will be the last two houses to be shown.
  K is not shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  
Analysis:
  Since J must be shown in the evening, K cannot be shown in the morning, and L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, we can conclude that the order of showing the houses must be J _ _ _ M _ _ or _ _ J _ M _ _. 
  Option A is not possible because K cannot be shown in the morning.
  Option B is possible because it is shown that L must be shown at some time after K is shown.
  Option C is not possible because J must be shown in the evening, which means all the other houses have to be shown before it.
  Option D is not possible because it is shown that the third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  Option E is possible because it does not violate any of the given rules.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day, with specific rules for when each house can be shown.
  J must be shown in the evening, which means it will be the last house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, which means it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, which means it can be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening, which means that M, N, O, and P are the only options for those time slots.
  
Analysis:
  A: If K is shown at some time after J is shown, then K cannot be shown in the morning. This contradicts the given rule that K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: If L is shown at some time after J is shown, then J cannot be shown in the evening since J is the last house to be shown. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: If P is shown at some time after J is shown, then P must be one of the last two houses to be shown in the evening. This is possible since M, N, O, and P are the only options for the last two time slots. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: The given rules do not provide any information about the order in which N and O are shown. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: If both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown, then K must be shown in the morning or afternoon. This contradicts the given rule that K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day, and the order of showing the houses is specified.
  J will be shown in the evening, K cannot be shown in the morning, and L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown is not possible because J must be shown in the evening.
  B: L must be shown at some time after K is shown, and J must be shown in the evening, so L cannot be shown at some time after J is shown.
  C: P can be shown at some time after J is shown because the order of showing the houses is not specified for houses 6 and 7.
  D: The order of showing N and O is not specified, so they can be shown at some time after M is shown.
  E: K cannot be shown in the morning, and P can be shown at some time after K is shown, so it is possible that both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses in one day, with specific rules for when certain houses can be shown.
  J must be shown in the evening, so it can't be one of the first two houses.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown between K and M, so it must be shown in the afternoon.
  M must be shown in the afternoon, so it cannot be one of the last two houses.
  N and O must be shown in the morning or afternoon, so they cannot both be shown after M.
  P must be shown in the afternoon or evening, so it cannot be one of the first two houses.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  Since J must be shown in the evening, it cannot be one of the first two houses. This means that K must be one of the first two houses. Since L must be shown between K and M, it must be one of the afternoon houses. This means that P must be one of the last two houses. Since L must be shown before M, M must be the last house shown in the afternoon. This means that N and O cannot both be shown after M. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that L is shown at some time after J is shown.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses in a single day, with a specific order.
  J must be shown in the evening, which means it will be the last two houses to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown between K and M.
  
Analysis:
  A: If K is shown after J, then J cannot be shown in the evening, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: Since L must be shown between K and M, and J must be shown in the evening, the only available time slot for L is in the afternoon. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: As J must be shown in the evening, and P is either sixth or seventh, P will be shown after J. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: Since M is the fourth house to be shown, and only three houses are shown in the afternoon, then N and O cannot be shown after M. Therefore, D is not true.
  E: Since K cannot be shown in the morning, and both N and P are either the sixth or the seventh house to be shown, then N and P cannot be shown after K. Therefore, E is not true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K is not shown at some time after J is shown. Eliminate.
  B: J must be shown in the evening, and L must be shown after K and before M. So, L cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. Eliminate.
  C: J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, P is shown at some time after J is shown. Keep it.
  D: There is no information about N and O. Eliminate.
  E: L must be shown at some time after K is shown. Therefore, it is not possible that both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. Eliminate.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns 3 class 2 buildings.
  RealProp owns 1 class 1 building and 2 class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns 1 class 1 building and 1 class 2 building.
  Trades can only happen between buildings of the same class or between a class 1 building and two class 2 buildings or between a class 2 building and two class 3 buildings.

Analysis:
  If Trustcorp ends up with no class 2 buildings, then the only way this can happen is if they trade all of their class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings then it would no longer own any class 2 buildings. In this case, one of the Trustcorp's class 2 buildings (King Building or Meyer Building or Ortiz Building) will be traded with a Southco's class 3 building (Lynch Building) and a RealProp's class 3 building (Yates House). 
  Alternatively, if Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for a class 1 building, then it would need to trade another class 2 building for two class 3 buildings to end up with no class 2 buildings. In this case, one of the Trustcorp's class 2 buildings (King Building or Meyer Building or Ortiz Building) will be traded with Southco's class 1 building (Flores Tower) and RealProp's class 2 building (Zimmer House). 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower), and two class 3 buildings (Yates House and Zimmer House).
  Southco owns a class 1 building (Flores Tower) and a class 2 building (Lynch Building).
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings (King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building).
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We are told that Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded away all of their class 2 buildings. 
  We know that Trustcorp started with three class 2 buildings, and each trade must involve one building of the same class, or one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded each of their class 2 buildings for either one class 1 building or two class 3 buildings. 
  
  A: We do not know whether RealProp owns a class 1 building or not, as they also own two class 3 buildings.
  B: We know that Southco owns a class 2 building (Lynch Building), so this statement cannot be true.
  C: We do not know whether Southco has made a trade with Trustcorp or not, as the statement does not provide any information about this.
  D: We know that RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is a class 1 building, so this statement cannot be true.
  E: We know that RealProp owns the Zimmer House, which is a class 3 building, so this statement cannot be true.
  
Conclusion: 
  The only statement that must be true is that Trustcorp has traded away all of their class 2 buildings. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  If Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings, then RealProp must own a class 1 building, which is not necessarily true. 
  If Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings, then Southco must have traded its class 2 building for two class 3 buildings from Trustcorp, which means Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp. 
  Therefore, the answer is C.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building, a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then they either traded all their class 2 buildings or they never had any class 2 buildings to begin with.
  
Analysis:
  Option A is not necessarily true as RealProp only owns one class 1 building.
  Option B is not necessarily true as Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Option C is likely true as Trustcorp needs to trade their class 2 buildings to obtain class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  Option D is not necessarily true as RealProp owns the Garza Tower.
  Option E is not necessarily true as RealProp owns the Zimmer House.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then it must have traded away all of its class 2 buildings.
  A: RealProp owns one class 1 building (Garza Tower) and two class 3 buildings (Yates House and Zimmer House). This choice does not provide any information about Trustcorp's trades.
  B: Southco owns one class 1 building (Flores Tower) and one class 2 building (Lynch Building). This choice conflicts with the information that Southco has traded with Trustcorp, which means they must have owned a class 2 building at some point.
  C: If Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp, then it must have owned a class 2 building at some point. This choice contradicts the information that Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  D: Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp. This choice is incorrect.
  E: Zimmer House is owned by RealProp. This choice does not provide any information about Trustcorp's trades.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
  A: We don't know if RealProp owns a class 1 building, as they own two class 3 buildings as well.
  B: Southco owns at least one class 1 building, so this is not true.
  C: Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so if Southco has made a trade with Trustcorp, it must have been a trade of a class 2 building, which would mean Trustcorp still owns at least one class 2 building.
  D: Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, so this is not true.
  E: Zimmer House is owned by RealProp, so this is not true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some trades.
  
Answer:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some trades, it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for other buildings or it has traded a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. Therefore, it must have traded either the King Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building for other buildings. 
  Since Trustcorp owned only class 2 buildings, it must have traded a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. Therefore, one of the buildings that Trustcorp traded away must be a class 2 building, and the other two must be class 3 buildings. 
  The only company that owns class 3 buildings is RealProp. Therefore, RealProp must have traded one of its class 1 buildings for two class 3 buildings from Trustcorp. Since RealProp owns only one class 1 building, it must be the Garza Tower. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp cannot trade any of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings, it means that Trustcorp cannot trade any of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp can only trade its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings or for other class 2 buildings. 
  The only way for Trustcorp to end up with no class 2 buildings after some number of trades is if it trades all of its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings. This means that RealProp and Southco must have traded their class 2 buildings with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, Southco must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class, Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, TrustCorp must have traded its only class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. This means that Trustcorp would only own class 1 and class 3 buildings.
  A: RealProp owning a class 1 building is not a necessary conclusion based on the given information.
  B: It is not necessary that Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco making a trade with Trustcorp is not a necessary conclusion based on the given information.
  D: Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp.
  E: Zimmer House is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns 1 class 1 building, 2 class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns 1 class 1 building, 1 class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns 3 class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
Analysis:
  - If Trustcorp has made any trades, it must have traded away at least one of its class 2 buildings, which means it would still own at least 1 class 2 building after the trades. Therefore, (C) cannot be true.
  - If RealProp owns a class 1 building, it cannot be traded for two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings. This means RealProp cannot be involved in any trades that result in Trustcorp owning no class 2 buildings. Therefore, (A) cannot be true.
  - If Southco owns only class 2 buildings, it cannot trade any of its buildings for two class 3 buildings. This means Southco cannot be involved in any trades that result in Trustcorp owning no class 2 buildings. Therefore, (B) cannot be true.
  - The only remaining option is (E). If Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House, it can trade it for two class 3 buildings, which would still leave it with only class 2 buildings. Therefore, (E) must be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, means Wellspring performs in slot 4 and Xpert performs in slot 5.
Analysis: 
  From the given information, we can conclude that Wellspring and Zircon perform in slot 4 and Xpert performs in slot 5. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot 2. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign cannot perform in slot 4 or 5. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy cannot perform in slot 5. This leaves us with only one option.
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform in six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
  A: If Uneasy is in slot five, then Zircon must be in slot six. But Zircon must play in an earlier slot than Xpert, so this is not possible.
  B: If Vegemite is in slot three, then Zircon must be in slot six which violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  C: If Wellspring is in slot three, then Zircon must be in slot six which violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  D: If Zircon is in slot two, then Wellspring must be in slot one and Xpert must be in slot three. But Uneasy can not be in slot four or five because Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Uneasy must be in slot six. But Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, so this arrangement is not possible.
  E: If Zircon is in slot four, then Wellspring must be in slot three and Xpert must be in slot five. This arrangement satisfies all the constraints.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Six slots are numbered from one to six. 
  - Six bands will perform in each slot exactly once. 
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. 
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. 
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. 
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots two and three in some order.
  
Elimination:
  - A: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots two and three in some order. So, Uneasy cannot perform in slot five. Eliminate A.
  - B: Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots. So, Vegemite cannot perform in slot three. Eliminate B.
  - C: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots two and three in some order. So, Wellspring cannot perform in slot three. Eliminate C.
  - D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then Wellspring and Zircon cannot perform in earlier slots than Xpert as required. Eliminate D.
  - E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then Yardsign must perform in slot three and Vegemite must perform in slot one. Then, Wellspring cannot perform in slot two. Eliminate E.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands are filling the six slots at a benefit concert.
  - The slots are numbered slot one through slot six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
  A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, then Zircon must perform in slot six, which violates the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one, which violates the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Xpert must perform in slot four, which violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then Vegemite must perform in slot one, which violates the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then Xpert must perform in slot five, and Uneasy must perform in slot six, which satisfies all the constraints. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find a possible order for the six bands to perform in the concert. 
  Vegemite must perform before Zircon (Constraint 1).
  Wellspring and Zircon must perform before Xpert (Constraint 2).
  Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots (Constraint 3).
  Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots (Constraint 4).
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order must be one of the following: Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert or Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert.
  
Analysis: 
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order must be one of the following: 
  Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert or Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert. 
  According to Constraint 1, Vegemite must perform before Zircon. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot two. 
  According to Constraint 4, Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, so Vegemite cannot perform in slot three. 
  According to Constraint 3, Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy cannot perform in slot five. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 slots numbered from 1 to 6.
  - There are 6 bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
Analysis:
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the two bands can only be WX or YX.
  - If the order is WX, then Zircon must perform in slot 1, and Vegemite must perform in slot 3. This means that Yardsign cannot perform in slot 1, 2, or 3, so Yardsign must perform in slot 4, and Uneasy must perform in one of the last two slots (5 or 6). Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot 5, so option A is false.
  - If the order is YX, then Vegemite must perform in slot 1, and Zircon must perform in slot 2. This means that Yardsign must perform in slot 3, and Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots (4, 5, or 6). Therefore, Uneasy can perform in slot 5, so option A could be true.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The slots are numbered from one to six.
  - Six bands will perform in one slot each.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the slots could be one of the following:
  1. Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Zircon, Uneasy
  2. Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Uneasy
  3. Vegemite, Yardsign, Wellspring, Xpert, Zircon, Uneasy
  4. Vegemite, Yardsign, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Uneasy
  5. Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, Xpert, Zircon, Uneasy
  6. Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, Zircon, Xpert, Uneasy
  
Option A is not possible, because Uneasy cannot perform in slot five.
Option B is not possible, because Vegemite cannot perform in slot three if Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
Option C is possible, as Wellspring could perform in slot three if Xpert performs in slot four.
Option D is not possible, because Zircon cannot perform in slot two if Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
Option E is possible, as Zircon could perform in slot four if Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.

To satisfy the constraints, the order of the bands must be: Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy.

Analysis:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the bands will be Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy.
  A: Uneasy cannot perform in slot five as it is one of the last three slots.
  B: Vegemite cannot perform in slot three as it is after Zircon.
  C: Wellspring cannot perform in slot three as it is before Xpert.
  D: Zircon must perform in slot three as it is before Xpert and after Vegemite.
  E: Zircon cannot perform in slot four as it is before Xpert.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are six slots at the benefit concert, numbered slot one through slot six.
  There are six bands that will perform at the benefit concert: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Zircon must perform in slot one or two, and Vegemite must perform in slot three or four.
  
Analysis:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Zircon must perform in slot one or two, and Vegemite must perform in slot three or four. 
  A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or two, which is not possible because Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot one or two, which is possible. 
  C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Xpert must perform in slot four, which is not possible because Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then Vegemite must perform in slot three, which is possible.
  E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then Vegemite must perform in slot five, which is not possible because Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

- The six bands that will perform are Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
- Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
- If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order could be either Wellspring-Xpert or Yardsign-Wellspring-Xpert.

Analysis:
- Choice A conflicts with the condition that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots since slot five is not one of the last three slots.
- Choice B conflicts with the condition that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon since slot three is not earlier than slot two.
- Choice C is consistent with the given conditions and the possible orders. Wellspring can perform in slot three if Yardsign performs in slot one, followed by Wellspring in slot two, and then Xpert in slot three.
- Choice D conflicts with the condition that Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Xpert since slot two is not earlier than slot three.
- Choice E is consistent with the possible orders. Zircon can perform in slot four if Yardsign performs in slot one, followed by Wellspring in slot two, Xpert in slot three, and then Zircon in slot four.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  Since Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, if Kayne is not assigned to Yemen, then Jaramillo cannot be assigned to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, Landon cannot be assigned to Yemen or Venezuela.
  Since Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, and Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, then Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen.
  Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to Zambia, and Landon must be assigned to Yemen.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  If Ong is assigned as the ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as an ambassador to one of the countries, then Kayne is also assigned as an ambassador.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as an ambassador to Zambia or Yemen. Since either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, Novetzke must be assigned as an ambassador to the remaining country, which is Yemen or Zambia. Since Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, the remaining ambassadorship must be assigned to Venezuela and Jaramillo must be assigned as an ambassador to Venezuela. Hence, the other two ambassadors assigned would be Kayne and Novetzke, so the answer is (D) Kayne and Novetzke. Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("A")  
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia or Venezuela. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to Venezuela or Zambia. However, we already know that Ong is assigned to Venezuela, so Jaramillo must be assigned to Zambia. Hence, Landon must be assigned to Yemen. Therefore, the only possible assignment of ambassadors is Ong to Venezuela, Jaramillo to Zambia, and Landon to Yemen. Thus, the answer is A.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: 
    - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
    - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
    - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
    - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, we cannot assign Kayne as ambassador to Yemen.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. We can assign Jaramillo to Yemen, and therefore, we must assign Kayne to the remaining country which is Zambia. As per the constraints, Landon is assigned to Zambia. Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon. Hence, the correct answer is A.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to one of the remaining two countries, Zambia or Yemen. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, if Kayne is assigned to Yemen, then Jaramillo must be assigned to Zambia. 
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, Landon must be assigned to Zambia. 
  Finally, either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Since Kayne is already assigned, Novetzke must not be assigned. 
  Thus, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as an ambassador, then Kayne is also assigned as an ambassador.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as the ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as the ambassador to Yemen. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned as an ambassador, then Kayne must also be assigned as an ambassador.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia. 
  Finally, either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. 
  With Ong assigned to Venezuela, and Kayne not assigned to Yemen, then either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen. 
  This leaves only two possible scenarios: Jaramillo and Landon, or Kayne and Novetzke, as the other two ambassadors.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints:
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
  We know that Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. According to the constraints, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, if Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Novetzke must be assigned to one of the two remaining ambassadorships. Landon's ambassadorship must be to Zambia. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, we know that Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia, and Novetzke must be assigned to either Yemen or Zambia. Since Landon is assigned to Zambia, Jaramillo must be assigned to the remaining country, which is Yemen. Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned are Kayne and Landon.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.

Reasoning:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. So Kayne is assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. So, if Kayne is assigned to Venezuela, then Jaramillo will also be assigned to Venezuela.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. So, Landon is assigned to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. So Novetzke is assigned to Yemen.

A: Both Lifestyle photographs are by Fuentes, which means no photograph from Fuentes can be in the Sports section. This violates the condition that the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section. Also, one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, which means Hue needs at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section, which is not the case here. Thus, A is not an acceptable selection.

Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly 3 days feature Himalayan kittens, but not day 1.
  - Rottweilers can't be featured on any day with Himalayans.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.

A: If Siamese is featured on day 2, then Himalayan must be featured on day 3, which violates the condition that no breed can be featured on two consecutive days. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: If Himalayans are featured on day 7, then they must be featured on days 2 and 6, but this would mean they are featured on three consecutive days, which is not allowed. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: This could be true. If Himalayans are featured on days 2, 3, and 5, then Rottweilers could be featured on day 4 along with Himalayans.
D: This cannot be true because Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5 if Himalayans are featured on day 3.
E: This cannot be true because if Manx is featured on day 6, then Rottweilers must be featured on day 5, which violates the condition that Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day with Himalayans.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

B: If any breed is featured on day 1, then it is not featured on day 7. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
C: Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, Himalayans can only be featured on days 2, 3, and 4. If Rottweilers are featured on day 4, then they cannot be featured on day 5, 6, or 7 because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, this choice is possible.
D: If Rottweilers are featured on day 5, then they cannot be featured on day 6 or 7 because Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
E: If Newfoundlands are featured on day 6, then they cannot be featured on day 7 because no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, so Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, so Himalayans can only be featured on days 2-6.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, so Rottweilers cannot be featured on days 4-6.
  
Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
  - Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5. 
  - Greyhounds and Siamese cannot both be featured on day 2 because no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Greyhounds and Himalayans cannot both be featured on day 7 because any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Rottweilers and Himalayans cannot both be featured on day 4 because Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  - Newfoundlands and Manx cannot both be featured on day 6 because Newfoundlands are not one of the possible breeds featured on days 1-3.

  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 and not on any day that features Himalayans. So, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4.
  - If Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5, then Manx cannot be featured on day 6.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6. This is possible since no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Also, none of the given conditions restrict this combination.
Response 6:
Knowledge:

- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 2 because no breed can be featured on two consecutive days, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1.

- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Therefore, Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers can be featured on days 2, 4, 5, 6, but not on day 3.

- Manx can be featured on days 2, 4, 5, 6, but not on day 3.
- Newfoundlands can be featured on days 3, 5, 6, 7, but not on day 4.
- Therefore, the only valid choice is D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:

  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Solution:
  - Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1, it cannot be featured on day 2. Therefore, Choice A is not possible.
  - Since any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1, it cannot be featured on day 7. Therefore, Choice B is not possible.
  - Since Himalayans are not featured on day 1, and they are featured on exactly three days, they can only be featured on days 2, 3, and 4, or days 3, 4, and 5, or days 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, Rottweilers cannot be featured on days 4 or 5. Therefore, Choice C is not possible.
  - Since Manx cannot be featured on day 4, and Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, they can only be featured on days 2, 3, and 5, or days 3, 5, and 6. Therefore, Choice D is possible.
  - Since Newfoundlands cannot be featured on day 7, and Manx cannot be featured on day 4, they can only be featured on days 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, Choice E is not possible.

- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1, then the next day (day 2) cannot feature any breed that cannot be featured alongside Greyhounds. So, it cannot be A.
- Since Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, then Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7. So, it cannot be B.
- Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, then they can only be featured on days 3 to 6. If Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4, then the third Himalayan day must be day 6, which means that Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5. So, it cannot be C.
- Since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4. If Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5, then the only other day that Manx can be featured is day 7, but this is impossible because any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. So, it cannot be D.
- Since Newfoundlands and Manx cannot be featured alongside Greyhounds, then Newfoundlands and Manx cannot be featured on days 5 and 6. This means that Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 7. So, it is E.

  B: Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on day 7.
  C: Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on day 4.
  D: Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days and not on day 1, then there is only one day where Himalayans are not featured. Therefore, Rottweilers can only be featured on day 2 or day 6. Manx can only be featured on day 3 or day 7. So, Rottweilers and Manx cannot be both featured on day 5.
  E: Manx cannot be featured on day 7 because it would mean that no breed is featured on day 1. Therefore, Newfoundlands and Manx cannot be both featured on day 6.

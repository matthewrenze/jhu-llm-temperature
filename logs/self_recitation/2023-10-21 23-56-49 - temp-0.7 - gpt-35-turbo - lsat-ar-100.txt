### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Knowledge: Five students review exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation. 
Conditions:
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
If exactly three of the students review Undulation:
- The two other plays must be reviewed by two students each.
- The two students who review the same play must not be Lopez or Megregian.
- The student who does not review Undulation must review the two other plays.
- Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, neither of them can review Undulation.
- Therefore, the student who does not review Undulation must be Jiang.
- This means that Megregian must review Undulation, and Lopez must review Sunset.
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation. (False)
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. (True)
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation. (True)
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. (False)
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. (False)
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Method:
  - If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  - From the given conditions, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian review Undulation.
  - Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, so Megregian reviews both Undulation and Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang does not review Tamerlane.
  - Therefore, Jiang reviews Sunset.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  - They each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

We are told that exactly three students review Undulation.
If Megregian reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Jiang can review it.
If Kramer reviews Undulation, then Megregian has to review Tamerlane and O'Neill has to review Sunset.
If O'Neill reviews Undulation, then Megregian has to review Tamerlane and Kramer has to review Sunset.
If Lopez reviews Undulation, then Megregian has to review Tamerlane and O'Neill has to review Sunset. 

A: Megregian could potentially review Undulation.
B: O'Neill could potentially review Undulation.
C: Jiang cannot review Undulation because neither Lopez nor Megregian can review any play that Jiang reviews.
D: Lopez cannot review Tamerlane because both Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.
E: O'Neill cannot review Sunset because if three students review Undulation, then Kramer has to review Sunset.

Therefore, the answer is either A or B. Since we don't have enough information to determine which one is true, the answer is None of the Above.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Five students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review one or more of exactly three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed Tamerlane. Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Undulation, and the other student who reviewed Undulation is either Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian.

A: Megregian does not review Undulation. This is impossible since we know that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane and exactly two of the students reviewed the same play or plays as each other.
B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. This is impossible since we know that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane and exactly two of the students reviewed the same play or plays as each other.
C: Jiang reviews Undulation. This is possible since we don't know which play Jiang reviewed, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play Jiang reviewed.
D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. This is impossible since we know that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane.
E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. This is impossible since we know that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane and exactly two of the students reviewed the same play or plays as each other.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly three of the students review Undulation.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Solution:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed Tamerlane. Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane and neither of them reviewed Undulation. Additionally, neither Lopez nor Megregian can review any play that Jiang reviewed. If Jiang reviewed Undulation, then Megregian and Lopez would be left with only Tamerlane to review, but that would mean there are three students reviewing Tamerlane, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Jiang does not review Undulation, and it is possible that Megregian reviewed Undulation. Also, since Kramer and Lopez each reviewed fewer plays than Megregian, and Megregian did not review Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez each reviewed only one play, which must be either Sunset or Tamerlane. Thus, option D is not possible, option E is not possible, and option C is possible. If Jiang reviewed Sunset, then Lopez reviewed Tamerlane and Megregian reviewed Undulation. Therefore, Option A is not possible. If Jiang reviewed Tamerlane, then Lopez and Kramer reviewed Sunset and Megregian reviewed Undulation. Therefore, Option B is not possible. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  5 students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review 1 or more of 3 plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play reviewed by Jiang.
  Exactly 2 students review the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly 3 students review Undulation, then the 2 other students must review the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly 3 students review Undulation, then two of the students must review the same play or plays as each other. It is not possible for all 5 students to each review a different play, because that would mean that only 2 plays have been reviewed and the condition of exactly 2 students reviewing the same play or plays would not be met. Therefore, the remaining 2 students must both review the same play as each other. 
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation because they do not review any play reviewed by Jiang. Then, Kramer and O'Neill must both review the same play as each other to satisfy the condition of exactly 2 students reviewing the same play or plays. But this is not possible because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, then Lopez and Kramer must both review Undulation to satisfy the condition of exactly 2 students reviewing the same play or plays. However, it is given that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must review Undulation. 
  If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez must both review Undulation and thus Kramer and Lopez will review exactly the same play as each other. This would satisfy the condition of exactly 2 students reviewing the same play or plays. Therefore, O'Neill does not have to review Undulation.
  Lopez cannot review Tamerlane because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and exactly 2 students can review the same play or plays. Therefore, it is not possible for Lopez to review Tamerlane. 
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer and Lopez must both review Undulation to satisfy the condition of exactly 2 students reviewing the same play or plays. But this is not possible because Megregian must review Undulation, and Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. Therefore, O'Neill cannot review Sunset.
  
Action: Answer("B") - O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Five students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed either Sunset or Tamerlane.
  A: We do not know whether Megregian reviewed Undulation or not.
  B: We do not know whether O'Neill reviewed Undulation or not.
  C: This cannot be true because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  D: This cannot be true because we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  E: This cannot be true because we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Five students review exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, the third student that reviews Undulation must be either Jiang, Megregian, Kramer, or O'Neill.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then both Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian, which means that they both cannot review Undulation. Thus, A is false and can't be true.
  If O'Neill reviews Undulation, then Kramer and O'Neill would review two plays in common, Tamerlane and Undulation, which means that the third student that reviews the same play or plays as them must be either Jiang, Megregian, or Lopez. However, neither Lopez nor Megregian can review the same play or plays as Jiang, which means that Jiang must review Undulation. Therefore, if exactly three of the students review Undulation, O'Neill must review Undulation. Thus, B is false and can't be true, and C is true.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian and Kramer would review fewer plays than Lopez, which means that neither of them can review Undulation. Therefore, D is false and can't be true.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then he would review only two plays, Tamerlane and Sunset, which means that the third student that reviews the same play or plays as him must be either Jiang, Megregian, or Lopez. However, neither Lopez nor Megregian can review the same play or plays as Jiang, which means that Jiang must review Undulation, and the two other students that review the same play or plays as each other must be Megregian and Kramer. This is not possible because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, E is false and can't be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  Three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Each student reviews one or more of the three plays, but not any other plays.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, there are only two possibilities:
  1. Kramer and Lopez both review Undulation and the third student who reviews Undulation does not review any other play.
  2. Kramer or Lopez reviews Undulation and the other two students who review Undulation review it together with another play, one student reviewing two plays and the other student reviewing only one.
  
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation. - This cannot be true if exactly three of the students review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. - This can be true in both possibilities.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation. - This cannot be true if exactly three of the students review Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. - This cannot be true if exactly three of the students review Undulation.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. - This can be true in both possibilities.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  - The students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Considering the given conditions, if exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must both review Tamerlane. Thus, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and only one of them can review Undulation. Also, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, the possible scenarios are:
- Jiang reviews Sunset.
- Megregian reviews Undulation.
- O'Neill does not review Undulation. Answer: B

B: a 2-day voicemail target - This target can be set for more than one client as nothing in the conditions restricts it.
C: a 2-day website target - This target cannot be set for both Solide and Truvest, as Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
D: a 3-day voicemail target - This target can be set for more than one client as nothing in the conditions restricts it.
E: a 3-day website target - This target cannot be set for more than one client as none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, and a 3-day website target implies that the voicemail target is shorter than 3 days, which is not possible.

Analysis:
  If one target is set for more than one of the clients, then the condition that each client must have a different target is violated.
  The 1-day website target must be set for one of the clients since the other two clients cannot have a website target shorter than their voicemail target.
  The 2-day voicemail target must be set for one of the clients since the other two clients cannot have a voicemail target shorter than their website target.
  The 3-day website and voicemail targets are the longest targets and could be set for more than one client.
  To satisfy the other conditions, Image must have the shortest voicemail target and Solide must have the shortest website target.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Each building is categorized as class 1, class 2, or class 3.
- Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower are class 1 buildings. Southco does not have any class 3 buildings to offer in return for the Yates House and the Zimmer House. Trustcorp does not have any class 1 buildings to offer in return for the Flores Tower. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.
B: RealProp: the Garza Tower is class 1 and the King Building and the Ortiz Building are class 2. Southco: the Flores Tower is class 1 and the Lynch Building is class 2. Trustcorp: the Meyer Building is class 2 and the Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3. This scenario is possible because each trade involves buildings of different classes.
C: RealProp: the Garza Tower is class 1 and the Lynch Building is class 2. Southco: the Flores Tower is class 1 and the Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3. Trustcorp: the King Building and the Meyer Building are class 2, and it does not have any class 3 buildings to offer. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.
D: RealProp: the Garza Tower is class 1 and the Yates House is class 3. Southco: the Flores Tower is class 1 and the Lynch Building is class 2. Trustcorp: the Meyer Building is class 2, and the King Building and the Ortiz Building are class 3. This scenario is not possible because the Yates House cannot be traded for two class 2 buildings.
E: RealProp: the Garza Tower is class 1 and the Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3. Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building are class 2. Trustcorp: the Flores Tower is class 1 and the King Building and the Meyer Building are class 2. This scenario is possible because each trade involves buildings of different classes.

  A: RealProp trades one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. There is no combination of two class 2 buildings that can be traded for a class 1 building. 
  B: RealProp trades one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. There is no combination of two class 2 buildings that can be traded for a class 1 building. Therefore, this combination is not possible.
  C: RealProp trades one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. The only class 2 building he could trade for is King Building. But then Trustcorp will have three class 1 buildings (Garza Tower, Flores Tower, and King Building) which is not possible. Therefore, this combination is not possible.
  D: RealProp trades one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. There is no combination of two class 2 buildings that can be traded for a class 1 building. Therefore, this combination is not possible.
  E: RealProp trades one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. The only combination that satisfies this trade is Garza Tower for King Building and Ortiz Building. Southco and Trustcorp will have one class 1 building each and RealProp will have two class 2 buildings. Therefore, this combination is possible.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns 3 buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  The possible trades are:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  Since each trade must involve only one building, the total number of buildings owned by the three companies will remain the same after all trades are made. Therefore, there must be 3 buildings owned by each company after the trade(s).
  RealProp has only one class 1 building, so it cannot trade that building for two class 2 or two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has only one class 1 building and one class 2 building, so it cannot trade either of those for two buildings of the same or higher class.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings, so it can only trade one of them for two class 3 buildings.

Solution:
  The only possible trade is Trustcorp trading one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings. Therefore, the possible buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made are:
  RealProp: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp: King Building (class 2), Ortiz Building (class 3), and Meyer Building (class 3).
  Answer: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  RealProp: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3)
  Southco: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2)
  Trustcorp: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2)
  The trade must be one of the following:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  One trade must be made.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find a possible outcome of one trade that follows the given rules. 
  RealProp has one class 1 building, Southco has one class 1 building, and Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings. 
  In order to make a trade, each company must give and receive a building or two according to the rules.
  From the given options, the only possible trade that follows the rules is:
    - RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1)
    - Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3)
    - Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) for the Garza Tower (class 1) 
  This trade satisfies all the given rules and can result in the buildings owned by the three companies after the trade:
  RealProp: Flores Tower (class 1)
  Southco: Yates House (class 3), Zimmer House (class 3)
  Trustcorp: King Building (class 2), Ortiz Building (class 2)
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis: 
  Since each company owns buildings of different classes, it is not possible for any trade to occur of the type "Trading one building for one other building of the same class". Therefore, we can only consider trade types 2 and 3. Trade type 2 involves a class 1 building, so it is impossible for Trustcorp to participate in this type of trade. Trade type 3 involves a class 3 building, so it is impossible for RealProp to participate in this type of trade. Therefore, the only possible trades involve Southco trading the Flores Tower (class 1) for two of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings. 

A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building - Not possible as RealProp cannot trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House - Not possible since Trustcorp cannot trade two of their class 2 buildings for a class 1 building.
C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building - Not possible since this would require Trustcorp to trade two of their class 2 buildings for a class 1 building.
D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House - Not possible since this would require Trustcorp to trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building - This is possible since Southco can trade the Flores Tower (class 1) for two of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be one of the three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  RealProp can trade the Garza Tower for one of Southco's class 2 buildings or two of Trustcorp's class 3 buildings.
  Southco can trade the Flores Tower for one of RealProp's class 1 buildings or one of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp can trade one of its class 2 buildings for one of RealProp's class 1 buildings or two of Southco's class 3 buildings.

  Based on the given options, the possible trades are:
  - RealProp trades the Garza Tower for Trustcorp's two class 3 buildings
  - Southco trades the Lynch Building for RealProp's Yates House
  - Trustcorp trades the King Building for RealProp's Garza Tower

  After these trades, the companies will own the following buildings:
  RealProp: Yates House, Zimmer House, 2 Trustcorp's class 3 buildings
  Southco: Flores Tower, Lynch Building
  Trustcorp: Ortiz Building, 2 RealProp's class 3 buildings, King Building

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  To trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, we need at least two class 2 buildings to be available for trade. However, only Trustcorp owns class 2 buildings. Therefore, to make such a trade, Trustcorp has to be involved. 
  To trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, we need at least two class 3 buildings to be available for trade. However, only RealProp has class 3 buildings. Therefore, to make such a trade, RealProp has to be involved.
  Thus, the only possible trade is between RealProp and Trustcorp: RealProp trades the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp. This means that Trustcorp trades two class 2 buildings for one class 1 building. Southco cannot be involved in this trade.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp has a class 1 building, and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has a class 1 building, and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  Trades can only be made between buildings of the same class or as specified: 
    - One class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - One class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  RealProp has a class 1 building, so it can trade it for two class 2 buildings. Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings, so it can trade two of them for the class 1 building from RealProp. 
  Trustcorp now owns two class 2 buildings, and the class 1 building from RealProp. Southco has a class 1 building and a class 2 building. It cannot trade its class 1 building, so it can only trade the class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. RealProp has two class 3 buildings, so it can trade one of them for two class 2 buildings from Trustcorp. 
  After these trades, the buildings owned by the companies would be:
  RealProp: Garza Tower, Meyer Building, Yates House
  Southco: Flores Tower, Lynch Building
  Trustcorp: King Building, Ortiz Building, Zimmer House
  Which matches the buildings in option B.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns 3 buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  There are three types of trades that can be made:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings. The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade one for two class 2 buildings. Therefore, RealProp cannot trade their class 1 building with Southco or Trustcorp. The only option is for RealProp to trade the Garza Tower with the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building, which are owned by Southco. 
  Trustcorp only owns class 2 buildings, therefore they cannot trade their buildings for class 1 or class 3 buildings. The only option is for Trustcorp to trade one of their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings. However, there are no class 2 buildings owned by Southco or RealProp. Therefore, Trustcorp must trade two of their class 2 buildings with each other. 
  Based on the above, the only possible outcome is:
  RealProp: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  Southco: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building
  Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Meyer Building. 
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
    
Analysis:
  We have to make one trade only and the options are very limited. We can see that there is only one class 1 building and we have to trade it for two class 2 buildings. There is only one class 2 building in Southco's possession, and that is the Lynch Building. Therefore, we can conclude that the Garza Tower (class 1) has to be traded with the Lynch Building (class 2) of Southco. As a result, Southco will have two class 1 buildings and RealProp will have two class 2 buildings. Trustcorp is the only one left with three class 2 buildings.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in either chapter 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  - Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3. If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and X must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then S must be mentioned in either chapter 1, 2, 4, or 5, and Z must be mentioned in either chapter 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, W could be mentioned in chapter 6 if U is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The seven clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z must be mentioned exactly once, from chapter 1 to chapter 7. 
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating them.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then:
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and thus can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  - W must be mentioned after T, with exactly two chapters separating them. Thus W can be mentioned in chapter 5 or 7.
  - X must be mentioned in a chapter adjacent to U, and thus can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  - S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4 since it cannot be in adjacent chapters with Z.
  - R and Z can be mentioned in any chapter except chapters 1, 2 and 7 because of the constraints above.
  
Analysis: 
  U is mentioned in chapter 3, so T and X can be in chapters 2 and 4 (in any order). W is then in chapter 5 or 7, and S and Z cannot be adjacent. R can be in any of the remaining chapters, except chapter 1, 2 or 7.

Action: Answer("B") 
Choice B: R is mentioned in chapter 5, is a possible arrangement that follows the constraints.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7
  - Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Working with the constraints:
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T can only be mentioned in chapters 2 through 7.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. This means T can only be in chapters 2 through 5, and W can only be in chapters 5 through 7.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. This means S and Z cannot be in chapters 6 and 7.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. This means W and X cannot be in chapters 6 and 7.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. This means U and X cannot be in chapters 1, 2, or 7.

Analysis:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and T must be mentioned before W.
  - R can be mentioned in chapter 5, since W must be mentioned in chapters 5 through 7.
  - S cannot be mentioned in chapter 7, since S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - W can be mentioned in chapter 6, since Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 7 and W must be mentioned after T and two chapters before Z.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each of the clues is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis: 
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4, since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. 
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and it must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, which means T must be mentioned in chapter 5. 
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, and X cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or 5.

Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, if U is mentioned in chapter 3, one of the possibilities is that R is mentioned in chapter 1, S is not mentioned in chapter 7, W is not mentioned in chapter 6, and X is mentioned in chapter 4. Thus, R could be mentioned in chapter 5. The correct answer is (B).
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - There are seven chapters in the novel.
  - Each clue is used exactly once.
  - T cannot be in Chapter 1, but must be before W with two chapters in between.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If U is mentioned in Chapter 3:
  - T cannot be in Chapter 1.
  - W must be in Chapter 6.
  - X must be in Chapter 4.
  - Neither S nor Z can be in Chapter 2 or 4.
  - R can be in Chapter 1 or 5.
  
  A: If R is mentioned in Chapter 1, T cannot be mentioned before W.
  B: If R is mentioned in Chapter 5, T cannot be mentioned before W.
  C: S cannot be in Chapter 2 or 4.
  D: W must be in Chapter 6.
  E: X must be in Chapter 4.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  The order of clues is subject to certain constraints.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Since U is mentioned in chapter 3, then we know that the clue before U must not be X, and the clue after U must be X. Therefore, we must have one of the following two scenarios:
1. Chapter 2 is X and Chapter 4 is R or S, then Chapter 5 is T, Chapter 7 is Z, and Chapter 6 is W.
2. Chapter 2 is R or S, then Chapter 4 is X, Chapter 5 is T, Chapter 7 is Z, and Chapter 6 is W.

A: R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
B: If Chapter 5 is R, then Chapter 4 must be X, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
C: There is no constraint regarding the chapter in which S is mentioned, but if Chapter 6 is W, then Chapter 5 cannot be X, which means that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, which violates one of the constraints.
D: If Chapter 6 is W, then Chapter 4 must be X and Chapter 5 must be T, which means that Chapter 2 cannot be R or S, and therefore, this option is possible.
E: If Chapter 4 is X, then Chapter 2 must be R or S, which means that Chapter 5 cannot be T because there are only seven clues, and T must be mentioned. Therefore, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each chapter must have exactly one clue.
  The order of the clues must satisfy the following constraints:
    1. T cannot be in chapter 1
    2. T must be before W
    3. There must be exactly two chapters separating T from W.
    4. S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
    5. W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
    6. U and X must be in adjacent chapters.

For the given information, U is mentioned in chapter 3, so:
  - Chapters 2 and 4 must have clues other than U and X (because U and X must be in adjacent chapters).
  - T cannot be in chapter 1, so it must be in chapter 2 or later.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, so T cannot be in chapter 2, and it must be in chapter 3 or later.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be in chapter 2, and Z cannot be in chapter 4.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W cannot be in chapter 4, and X cannot be in chapter 2.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 1. - Possible, but not necessarily true.
B: R is mentioned in chapter 5. - Possible, but not necessarily true.
C: S is mentioned in chapter 7. - Possible, but not necessarily true.
D: W is mentioned in chapter 6. - Impossible, because W cannot be in chapter 4, and there must be two chapters separating T from W.
E: X is mentioned in chapter 4. - Impossible, because U must be in chapter 3, and U and X must be in adjacent chapters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
- Each of the seven clues is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
- T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
- If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
- T cannot be in chapter 1 and it must be before W with 2 chapters in between.
- That leaves chapters 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 for T and W.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither can be in chapter 6 if W is mentioned there.
- W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W cannot be in chapter 4 if X is mentioned there.
- U is in chapter 3, so R and S cannot be in chapters 2 and 4, respectively, if they are not adjacent to U.

Action: Answer("D")  
W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Solution:
If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4. 
Because U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Thus, E is the only possible answer choice which satisfies this constraint.
Therefore, the answer is: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z are each mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Since U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4. 
If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 5, so the only possible position for W is in chapter 6.
If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and R must be mentioned in chapter 1. 

Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1. - Possible
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5. - Impossible
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7. - Impossible, because S cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters with Z
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6. - Possible

  The students reviewing plays are Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  From the conditions given, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so answer choices A, C, D, and E are incorrect. 
  We also know that exactly two students review the same play, so we can eliminate choice B if any other choice is correct. 
  Choice B is the only one left, so it must be the answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. 
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 4, we can eliminate option A as only two students are reviewing Tamerlane.
Using condition 2, we can eliminate option E since none of the students who review Tamerlane could be Lopez or Megregian.
Using condition 3, we can eliminate option D since Megregian must review more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
Therefore, the answer is either B or C.
Using condition 4, we know that two students review the same play or plays as each other. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, the only possible option is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Five students are Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  - Each student reviews one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.

Analysis:
  - From the given conditions, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, options A, C, and E can be eliminated.
  - The condition "Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews" indicates that Jiang can only review Sunset or Undulation. 
  - Since two students must review exactly the same play or plays as each other, there must be only two students who review Tamerlane. 

Action: Answer("B") 
Option B is the only option that has exactly two students, Kramer and O'Neill, who review Tamerlane.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using the logic above, we can deduce that Megregian must review at least two plays since both Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane. 

Option A is not possible because Jiang cannot review any play that Megregian reviews.
Option B is possible because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and no other student can review Tamerlane.
Option C is not possible because Lopez cannot review Tamerlane since both Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.
Option D is possible because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and Megregian can review the third play. 
Option E is not possible because Megregian must review at least two plays. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Using the given information, we can conclude that:
  - From 1, Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.
  - From 3, only two students review the same play, so Kramer and O'Neill are the only pair who reviewed Tamerlane.
  - From 4, Kramer and Lopez reviewed Sunset and Undulation, and Megregian reviewed all three plays.
  - From 2, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed Tamerlane, so Jiang must have reviewed Tamerlane.
  
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("B")  (Kramer, O'Neill)
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  The other three students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  We need to select a list of students who review Tamerlane.
  
Elimination:
  Option A cannot be true because Jiang does not review the same play as Kramer.
  Option B cannot be true because only two students review the same play and this option has three students reviewing Tamerlane.
  Option C cannot be true because Megregian is not reviewing Tamerlane and it has three students reviewing Tamerlane.
  Option D could be true because it includes Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill, and we know Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, this option satisfies all the given conditions.
  Option E cannot be true because there is no overlap between the students who review Tamerlane and the students who review the other plays.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. The list of students who review Tamerlane could not include Jiang, since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.

Analysis:
  From condition 3, we know that the list of students who review Tamerlane must have exactly two students. So, we can eliminate options A, C, and D since they have more than two students. 
  From condition 2, we can eliminate option B since it only has two students and neither of them is Megregian, who reviews Tamerlane.
  Option E has three students, so we can eliminate it.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Five students - Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill - review plays Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Analysis: 
  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, but we need to see if any other students review Tamerlane as well. The condition states that exactly two students review the same play, which means that no more than two students can review Tamerlane. Therefore, the answer choices that have more than two students cannot be correct. Also, since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and we know that Jiang does not review Tamerlane, we can eliminate answer choices that include Jiang.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Five students are reviewing Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - If Megregian reviewed Tamerlane, only one student would share the same play as another student, violating the condition "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other."
  - Lopez cannot review Tamerlane, because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So, if Lopez reviewed Tamerlane, Megregian would not be able to review any plays, which violates the condition "five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays." 
  Therefore, the only possible answer is B: Kramer and O'Neill.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.

Based on the given conditions, we can deduce that Megregian is one of the students who review Tamerlane, as Kramer and O'Neill are the other two who review Tamerlane. 

Option A is incorrect because it includes Jiang, who did not review any play that Megregian reviewed. 
Option B is incorrect because it only includes two students while the question states that "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other." 
Option C is incorrect because it includes Lopez, who didn't review Tamerlane. 
Option D is correct because it includes all three students who reviewed Tamerlane, and Megregian is one of them. 
Option E is incorrect because it doesn't include Kramer, who reviewed Tamerlane.

Question: The organizer must at least select
Choices:
  A: one French novel and one French play
  B: one French novel and one Russian play
  C: one Russian novel and one French play
  D: two French novels
  E: two Russian novels
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The organizer must select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works.

- No more than 4 French works can be selected.
- At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

To meet the requirements, the organizer can select:
- 3 French novels + 1 Russian novel + 1 French play (total of 5 works)
- 3 French novels + 1 Russian novel + 1 French play + 1 Russian play (total of 6 works)

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The organizer will select at least 5 works and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works.
  The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
  No more than 4 French works are selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  The organizer can select at most 4 French works, so the organizer can select 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 French novels.
  The organizer must select at least 3 but no more than 4 novels, so the organizer must select 3 novels if 4 French works are selected, or must select 4 novels if 0, 1, 2, or 3 French works are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected, so if 0 or 1 French novels are selected, then 2 Russian novels must be selected, and if 2 French novels are selected, then 2 Russian novels must also be selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, so the organizer cannot select both French plays.
  Therefore, the organizer can select at most 1 French play and at least 2 French novels, which means the organizer must select at least 2 French works.
  The organizer must select at least 5 works, and if the organizer selects 2 French novels, 2 Russian novels, 1 French play, and 0 Russian plays, then the organizer will have selected 5 works, so this is the minimum number of works the organizer must select.
  Therefore, the organizer must at least select two French novels. Answer choice D is correct.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The organizer must select at least 5 and at most 6 works.
  The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
  No more than 4 French works can be selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Solution:
  We need to select works that conform to the given requirements and also satisfy the condition of selecting at least 5 works.
  The following combinations of works satisfy the requirements and contain at least 5 works:
  - 3 French novels, 2 Russian novels, 1 French play
  - 3 French novels, 2 Russian novels, 1 Russian play
  - 2 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 1 French play
  - 2 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 1 Russian play
  - 2 French novels, 2 Russian novels, 2 French plays (Russian play cannot be selected)
  Hence, the organizer must at least select two French novels. Therefore, the answer is D: two French novels. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The organizer must select at least 5 works and at most 6 works.
  The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
  No more than 4 French works are selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Analysis:
  We know that there must be at least 3 novels selected, and that there are 3 French novels and 3 Russian novels to choose from. So, at least one French novel and one Russian novel must be selected. 
  We also know that no more than 4 French works can be selected, so if one French novel is selected, at most 3 more French works can be selected. This means that at most 2 French plays can be selected. 
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, which means that at most 5 works can be selected. 
  Therefore, the minimum number of works that the organizer must select is 5.

Action: Answer("None of the above") - None of the choices provide the correct answer.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The organizer will select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works.

      - No more than 4 French works are selected.
      - At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
      - At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
      - If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
  
  A: This option is not correct because it only includes one French novel or one French play, but the organizer must select at least 3 novels and at least 2 plays.
  B: This option is not correct because it includes a Russian play and only one French novel, but the organizer must select at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
  C: This option is not correct because it includes only one French play and one Russian novel, but the organizer must select at least 2 plays and at least 3 novels.
  D: This option is correct. The organizer must select at least 2 French novels, and no more than 4 French works. Therefore, the organizer can select two French novels, two Russian novels, and two plays (one French and one Russian).

Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
  - This is impossible because RealProp does not own the Flores Tower.

  Trades must be of exactly one of the following kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: A cannot be true, because RealProp only owns one class 1 building (Garza Tower), and that building is not owned by Southco.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns three buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns two buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings: King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building.
  Trades can only be made between buildings of the same class or according to the rules: one class 1 building can be traded for two class 2 buildings, or one class 2 building can be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  A: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and is a class 1 building. Therefore, it cannot be true that RealProp owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Garza Tower (class 1) because there is only one Garza Tower and it is already owned by RealProp.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Therefore, it cannot be true that Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Meyer Building because Southco does not currently own the Meyer Building.
  C: Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Therefore, it cannot be true that Southco owns the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2) because Southco already owns the Flores Tower (class 1).
  D: Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2). Therefore, it cannot be true that Trustcorp owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) because Trustcorp already owns the Meyer Building (class 2).
  E: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1) and two class 3 buildings. Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings, but it cannot trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. Therefore, it cannot be true that the buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
- Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
- Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
- Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
        Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
        Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
        Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.

A: RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3). Flores Tower (class 1) is owned by Southco, not RealProp. So, this cannot be true.
B: Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2). Meyer Building (class 2) is owned by Trustcorp, not Southco. So, this cannot be true.
C: Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2). Garza Tower (class 1) is owned by RealProp, not Southco. So, this cannot be true.
D: Trustcorp owns Ortiz Building (class 2), which is not owned by Southco. So, this cannot be true.
E: Garza Tower (class 1) is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp. Meyer Building (class 2) is owned by Trustcorp, not RealProp. So, this cannot be true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Trades can be of 3 types: (1) trading one building for one other building of the same class, (2) trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or (3) trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  A: RealProp does not own Flores Tower, and it only owns one class 1 building. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: Southco owns Flores Tower but it does not own Meyer Building. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: Southco owns Garza Tower but it does not own Lynch Building. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp owns neither Flores Tower nor Ortiz Building. Therefore, D can be true.
  E: Trustcorp owns neither Garza Tower nor Meyer Building. Therefore, E can be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday since Hong does not testify on Monday.
  
  A: Franco cannot testify on Wednesday as Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia cannot testify on Monday as Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  C: Garcia cannot testify on Wednesday as Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong cannot testify on Tuesday as only two witnesses can testify on Tuesday and Franco and Hong cannot testify on the same day.
  E: Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday, so this option cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The hearing lasts three days, from Monday to Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day.
  - Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong cannot testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  - If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, Garcia cannot testify on that day.
  - Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, and Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, the other two witnesses must testify on Monday.
  - Since Hong cannot testify on Monday, only Garcia can testify that day.
  - Therefore, Franco must testify on Wednesday, and Hong must testify on Tuesday.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Five witnesses (Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson) are scheduled to testify over three days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must both testify on Tuesday. Therefore, the schedule must have:
  - Franco and Hong testifying on Tuesday.
  - Iturbe testifying on Wednesday.
  - At least one witness testifying on Monday.
  - Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday (since Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia), so Garcia must testify on Monday or Wednesday.
  - Since Hong does not testify on Monday, Garcia must testify on Monday, which means Jackson must testify on Wednesday.
  
Possible schedule:
  Monday: Garcia, Jackson, [Franco/Hong]
  Tuesday: Franco/Hong, Iturbe
  Wednesday: Iturbe, Jackson
  
Since there are two possible choices for who testifies on Tuesday, the answer cannot be uniquely determined.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, that means they cannot be scheduled on Monday. Hence, Franco must be scheduled on Tuesday or Wednesday.
If Franco is scheduled on Tuesday, then there would be three witnesses on Tuesday (Franco, Hong, and another witness) which would mean that only two witnesses would be left for Wednesday, but Iturbe must testify on Wednesday which would be impossible. Therefore, Franco must be scheduled on Wednesday.
Knowing that Franco testifies on Wednesday, we can deduce that Garcia cannot testify on Wednesday because Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday, and Hong must testify on Tuesday.
Since there must be exactly two witnesses on Tuesday, and we know that Hong is one of the witnesses, then the other witness must be either Garcia or Jackson. However, Garcia has already been scheduled for Monday, so Jackson must be scheduled on Tuesday.
Therefore, Iturbe is the only one left to testify on Monday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday (since Hong does not testify on Monday). Therefore, Franco must testify on either Tuesday or Wednesday. 

If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe also testifies on Wednesday (since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday). But this would make it impossible to have exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday (condition 3). So, Franco cannot testify on Wednesday.

Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday. This also means that Hong must testify on Monday (since Hong does not testify on Tuesday and there must be at least one witness testifying on Monday). 

According to condition 1, Garcia cannot testify on Monday if Franco testifies on Tuesday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday.

This leaves Iturbe to testify on Monday. 

Thus, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("D") Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  1. If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday since Franco and Hong cannot testify on the same day.
  2. From condition 4, Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  3. From condition 2, exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Franco and Hong cannot testify on Tuesday since they cannot testify on the same day. Therefore, Franco and Hong must testify on Monday and Wednesday (in some order).
  4. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday (condition 2), so Garcia must testify on Monday.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  2. The hearing is for three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  3. Each witness testifies on exactly one day.
  4. Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  5. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  6. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  7. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  8. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis: 
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday (since Hong does not testify on Monday). Therefore Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, if Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe must testify on Tuesday (since Iturbe must testify on Wednesday). This would mean that there are three witnesses (Garcia, Hong, and Jackson) testifying on Monday, which violates the condition that "at least one witness testifies on Monday." Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday. This means that Hong cannot testify on Tuesday (since Franco and Hong cannot testify on the same day), so Hong must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday, and Jackson must testify on Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson
  The hearing takes three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then they must testify on either Monday or Tuesday.
  
  A: Franco and Hong cannot both testify on Wednesday.
  B: There is no information to support or refute this statement.
  C: Franco and Garcia cannot both testify on Wednesday.
  D: If Hong testifies on Tuesday, then Franco must testify on Monday and there would be no conflict.
  E: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so this statement is true regardless of the scheduling conflict between Franco and Hong.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Five witnesses are scheduled to testify on three days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
- Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then that day cannot be Monday since Hong does not testify on Monday. Thus, Franco and Hong must be scheduled to testify together on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
If they are scheduled to testify on Tuesday, then there will be three witnesses (Franco, Hong, and one other) scheduled to testify on that day, which violates the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Franco and Hong must be scheduled to testify together on Wednesday, and Iturbe must be the only witness scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing takes exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday since Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco and Hong must both testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, since exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday, we know that Franco and Hong must both testify on Wednesday. This means that Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday since Iturbe must testify on Wednesday and we know that each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. Therefore, Iturbe must testify on Monday. Since Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, and Franco testifies on Wednesday, Garcia must testify on Monday.

  - In option B, Waite comes before the two recorded auditions, and the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, Waite must be audition number 4. Lugo must be audition number 2 because her audition will be recorded. Kammer must be audition number 1 because her audition will also be recorded and must take place before Trillo's audition. Yoshida must be audition number 6 because Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Zinn must be audition number 3, and Trillo must be audition number 5. Therefore, option B is valid.
  - In option C, Lugo comes before Kammer, which violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, option C is not valid.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the auditions needs to follow the conditions stated in the context.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, which means that the second recorded audition must be either the fifth or the sixth audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, which means that Waite's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, which means that Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, which means that Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition.
Analysis:
  Using the above knowledge, we can create a list of possible orders for the auditions:
  - Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida (second recorded audition is the fifth)
  - Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Zinn, Trillo, Yoshida (second recorded audition is the sixth)
  - Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Zinn, Yoshida (second recorded audition is the fifth)
  - Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Lugo, Yoshida (second recorded audition is the sixth)
  - Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida (second recorded audition is the fifth)
  - Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Lugo, Yoshida, Trillo (second recorded audition is the sixth)
  - Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida (second recorded audition is the fifth)
  - Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Yoshida, Lugo (second recorded audition is the sixth)
  Among the above possible orders, only one is listed as a choice:
  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. The order of the six auditions must satisfy all of the following conditions:
     a. The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
     b. The fifth audition must be recorded.
     c. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
     d. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
     e. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  2. The possible orders must satisfy the above conditions.
  
Analysis:
  We can start by using condition c to narrow down the possible orders. Waite cannot be the fifth audition, so the fifth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's. Using condition d, Kammer must audition before Trillo, so Kammer's audition cannot be the fifth or the sixth. Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, Kammer's audition must be the first or the second audition. If Kammer's audition is the first, then Waite's audition must be the second, and Lugo's audition must be the third. This means that Zinn's audition must be the fourth, which contradicts condition e. Therefore, Kammer's audition must be the second, and Waite's audition must be the first. This leaves us with three possible orders: A, C, and D. We can use condition e to eliminate A, because Zinn's audition must be before Yoshida's audition. We can use condition d to eliminate C, because Kammer's audition must be before Trillo's audition. Therefore, the only possible order is D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded. Thus, it cannot be either Lugo's or Kammer's audition.
  The fifth audition must be recorded. Thus, it must be either Lugo's or Kammer's audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Thus, Waite's audition must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Thus, Kammer's audition must be first or second and Trillo's audition must be third, fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Thus, Zinn's audition must be one of the first four auditions.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation:
  Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, it cannot be Lugo's audition. Thus, it must be Kammer's audition, which means Lugo's audition must be fifth. Therefore, the order of the auditions from first to last can be Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida. The only option that matches this order is D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A corporate manager is selecting employees for a research team. The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. The selection is constrained by the following conditions: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team?
Choices:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt
  B: Ortega and Wong
  C: Paine and Schmidt
  D: Thomson and Yoder
  E: Yoder and Zayre
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The team will include at least four employees.
  - The employees to choose from are Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

To answer this question, we need to find a pair of employees that must be on the team. One way to do that is to look for employees that are mentioned in the constraints that require other employees to be on the team with them.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. This means that Ortega and Paine cannot both be on the team if Myers is on the team.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. This means that if Schmidt is on the team, Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. This means that if Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  - Therefore, if we select Wong, we must also select Myers and Yoder. This makes the pair (Ortega, Wong) the only pair of employees that must be on the team.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees.
  - If Myers is selected, then Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team.
  - If Schmidt is selected, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  - If Wong is selected, then both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  
Analysis: 
  - If Ortega is selected, then neither Myers nor Wong can be on the team. This means that Ortega must be on the team with Schmidt, Thomson, and either Yoder or Zayre. Therefore, Ortega and Schmidt cannot be a pair of employees that must be on the team.
  - If Wong is selected, then Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. This means that Wong, Myers, Yoder, and one other employee must be on the team. Therefore, Wong and at least one of Myers or Yoder must be on the team. Thus, option B is correct.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The team must include at least four employees from the given eight employees.
  If Myers is on the team, then Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Ortega is on the team, then Myers cannot be on the team. 
  If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team, and then Wong cannot be on the team.
  If Paine is on the team, then Schmidt must also be on the team, and then Wong cannot be on the team.
  If Thomson is on the team, then Schmidt must also be on the team, and then Wong cannot be on the team.
  If Yoder is on the team, then Wong must also be on the team, and then Myers must also be on the team.
  If Zayre is on the team, then nothing can be inferred.
  So, the only pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Ortega and Wong.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Ortega is on the team, then Myers can't be on the team. 
  If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. 
  If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. 
  Therefore, if Ortega is not on the team, and Wong is on the team, then Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Thus, Ortega and Wong are a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Schmidt is on the team, Paine must also be on the team. Therefore, Paine and Schmidt must be on the team, or Paine and Thomson must be on the team. This makes option (C) the correct answer, as it includes both Paine and Schmidt.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The team must include at least four employees from a group of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, if at least one of Ortega and Wong must be on the team, then it follows that Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Thus, choice B is correct, as it includes the required pair of Wong and Myers. None of the other choices include a pair that must be on the team.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. This means that there is a pair of employees that must be on the team which includes Paine and Schmidt. Therefore, the answer is (C) Paine and Schmidt. 
  None of the other choices are correct because they don't include a pair of employees that must be on the team according to the given constraints.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are eight employees to select from: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  The research team will include at least four employees.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  To solve this question, we need to find a pair of employees where at least one of them must be on the team. This means that we cannot select a team that does not include any one of these employees. We can eliminate option A because it includes Ortega, and if Myers is on the team, Ortega cannot be on the team. We can eliminate option C because it includes Paine, and if Myers is on the team, Paine cannot be on the team. We can eliminate option E because it includes Zayre, and there is no information that suggests Zayre must be on the team. This leaves us with two options: B and D. We know that if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team, so we can select option B as the correct answer.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The research team will include at least four employees from a total of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  A: Neither Ortega nor Schmidt can be on the team if Myers is on the team.
  B: If Wong is on the team, Myers must also be on the team, so Wong and Yoder cannot be the only two members on the team.
  C: If Schmidt is on the team, Paine must also be on the team, so Ortega cannot be on the team.
  D: If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team, so Thomson cannot be on the team.
  E: There is no information that suggests that either Yoder or Zayre must be on the team.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Myers cannot be on the team if Ortega or Paine is on the team. 
  Schmidt must be on the team if Paine and Thomson are on the team. 
  Wong must be on the team if Myers and Yoder are on the team.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Myers is on the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. 
  If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must be on the team. 
  If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must be on the team. 
  Therefore, if we select Ortega and Wong, we can satisfy all the constraints.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
Action: Answer("D")  
Parking space #1 must be assigned to Robertson. By rule 4, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1. By rule 1, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6. By rule 2, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #6. Since Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6 and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #6, Xu must be assigned parking space #6. By elimination, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2. However, by rule 1, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1. Therefore, the only option that fits all the rules is D.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.

    3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    
Analysis:
  - According to rule 4, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - According to rule 3, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - According to rule 1, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - According to rule 2, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned parking space #2, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #3, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6.
  - The remaining two parking spaces are #4 and #5 and can be assigned to Souza and Vaughn in any order.
  - Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")

  Each employee must be assigned one of the parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
    Young > Togowa
    Xu > Souza
    Robertson > Young
    Robertson can be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The rules for assigning parking spaces are:
  - Young > Togowa
  - Xu > Souza
  - Robertson > Young
  - Robertson ∈ {#1, #2, #3, #4}
  
  A: Young is assigned space #1, but Robertson must be assigned either #1, #2, #3, or #4, so this is not possible.
  B: Robertson must be assigned a space between #1 and #4, but in this scenario, Robertson is assigned space #5, so this is not possible.
  C: This scenario satisfies all the rules given for the parking space assignment, so it could be a valid assignment.
  D: Robertson cannot be assigned space #5 or #6, so this is not a valid assignment.
  E: Robertson must be assigned a space between #1 and #4, but in this scenario, Robertson is assigned space #4, so this is a valid assignment.

Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The rules are:
  - Young > Togowa
  - Xu > Souza
  - Robertson > Young
  - Robertson in {1, 2, 3, 4}
  There are six people: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The correct answer must follow all of the rules above.
  
Analysis:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza and Xu cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6, then Xu must be assigned parking space #3 or #4. Since Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2 and Young > Togowa, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 and Young must be assigned parking space #2. Finally, since Vaughn cannot be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, then Vaughn must be assigned parking space #5 and Souza must be assigned parking space #6.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:

  Robertson must have a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means that Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  According to the rules, Robertson could be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. So, let's assign Robertson to parking space #2.
  Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #3 or #4, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  According to the rules, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. So, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 and Young must be assigned parking space #3.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. So, Souza must be assigned parking space #5 and Xu must be assigned parking space #6.
  Therefore, the only answer choice that satisfies all the rules is #1: Togowa - #1, Robertson - #2, Young - #3, Souza - #5, Vaughn - #6, and Xu - #4.
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
- Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.

Action: 
If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project:
- Ryan must be assigned to either 1921, 1922, or 1924.
- If Ryan is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
- If Ryan is assigned to 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to 1923. But Onyx cannot be assigned to 1923 because Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to that year.
- If Ryan is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project. But Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- Yoshio can be assigned to either 1921 or 1922 because Mollie is not assigned to the project yet.

Therefore, the only option that could be true is:
Choice: Answer("B") Mollie is assigned to 1921.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project:
  - Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Ryan cannot be assigned to 1924.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1924.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, neither Louis nor Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
- A: Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
- B: Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921.
- C: Onyx can be assigned to 1922.
- D: Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1924.
- E: Yoshio can be assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany must be the other three students assigned to the project.
  A: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so this cannot be true if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
  B: If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, so this could be true if Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, so this cannot be true if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
  D: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so this cannot be true if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
  E: This could be true if Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then the remaining two students must be assigned to 1921 and 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  
Analysis:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then the remaining two students must be assigned to 1921 and 1924. 
  If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means Onyx must be assigned to 1922. 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, which means Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. 
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then one of the following must be true: 
    1. Louis is assigned to 1923 and Mollie is assigned to 1921.
    2. Tiffany is assigned to 1923 and Mollie is assigned to 1922.
    3. Tiffany is assigned to 1924 and Mollie is assigned to 1921.
    4. Louis is assigned to 1924 and Mollie is assigned to 1922.
    5. Louis is assigned to 1923 and Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
    6. Tiffany is assigned to 1923 and Yoshio is assigned to 1922.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The project has four years assigned to each of the four students.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to this project, then there are only two possible scenarios:
  1. Mollie is not assigned to the project, Tiffany is not assigned to 1923, and Louis is assigned to 1923.
  2. Mollie is assigned to the project, Tiffany is assigned to 1923, and Ryan is assigned to the project.
  
  A: Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie can be assigned to 1921 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, because there is no restriction on which years Ryan and Yoshio can be assigned to.
  C: Onyx can be assigned to 1922 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, because there is no restriction on which year Onyx can be assigned to.
  D: Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1924 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, because Tiffany must be assigned to the project if Ryan is assigned to the project, which means Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1924 if Ryan is already assigned to a year.
  E: Yoshio can be assigned to 1922 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, because there is no restriction on which year Yoshio can be assigned to.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project. 
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  
  A: Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Tiffany is assigned to the project, which is required when both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, B could be true.
  C: If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned, then Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to the project when both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned. Therefore, D is not true.
  E: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project. Therefore, Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1922. Therefore, E is not true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project:
    - Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
    - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  
Analysis:
  - Since both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. It means that Onyx is assigned to 1922, and Ryan is assigned to 1923.
  - Since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, Tiffany is not assigned to 1923 because Ryan is assigned to it. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Because Onyx is assigned to 1922, Mollie must be assigned to 1921.
  - Yoshio is not assigned to 1921, 1922, or 1923. Therefore, Yoshio could be assigned to 1924.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany must not be assigned to the project.
  A: Louis cannot be assigned to the project if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
  B: Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 if Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
  C: Onyx can be assigned to 1922 if Yoshio is assigned to 1924.
  D: Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
  E: Yoshio can be assigned to 1922 if Onyx is assigned to 1923.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project:
    - Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
    - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
    - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
    - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  A: Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany is not one of the students assigned to the project.
  B: If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, so Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, so Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  D: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, but Tiffany is not one of the students assigned to the project, so Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1924.
  E: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Yoshio must be assigned to 1924, and Onyx must be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
To determine the correctness of the options:
  - Ryan and Yoshio are both assigned to the project, so Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  - Ryan is assigned to the project, so if Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must also be assigned.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. So, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1924.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so neither Ryan nor Yoshio can be assigned to that year.

Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, Onyx could be assigned to 1922.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are 3 days with 2 sessions each day, for a total of 6 sessions.
  2. Each session is led by a different lab assistant.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must be on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot be on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday morning. Also, Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's, so his session must be on Wednesday morning. That means that Lan and Nessa cannot be on Wednesday afternoon, so they must be on Thursday morning and Friday afternoon, but we don't know which one of them is on which day. That leaves Kevin and Rebecca for Wednesday afternoon. Therefore, we can determine which session each lab assistant leads for 4 of the lab assistants (Kevin, Rebecca, Julio, and Olivia).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. The lab sessions are scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday— with one session held each morning and one each afternoon.
  2. The lab assistants are Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then the schedule could look like this:
  
| Day        | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Wednesday      | Kevin | Lan |
| Thursday      | Nessa      |   Julio |
| Friday | Olivia | Rebecca      |

  Based on the schedule above, we can determine the lab assistants for all the sessions except for the Wednesday afternoon session.
  Therefore, the answer is: 
Action: Answer("B") - two.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions: Wednesday AM, Wednesday PM, Thursday AM, Thursday PM, Friday AM, and Friday PM.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
We are given that Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session. This means that Olivia's session must be on Friday, as Julio's session must be on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. We also know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa must lead the Wednesday afternoon session. This also means that Lan cannot lead the Wednesday afternoon session and therefore must lead the Friday morning session.

Thus, we have the following table:

|          | Wed AM | Wed PM | Thu AM | Thu PM | Fri AM | Fri PM |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Julio    |        |        |        | Thu PM |        |        |
| Kevin    |        |        |        |        |        |        |
| Lan      |        |        |        |        | Fri AM |        |
| Nessa    | Wed PM |        |        | Nessa  |        |        |
| Olivia   |        |        |        |        |        | Fri PM |
| Rebecca  |        |        |        |        |        |        |

We can see that we can determine the sessions for Kevin, Lan, Nessa, and Olivia, so the answer is D: four. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The lab sessions are scheduled over three days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - One assistant leads each session, and each assistant leads one morning and one afternoon session.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session:
  - The Wednesday afternoon session cannot be led by Lan or Olivia.
  - The Friday morning session cannot be led by Julio.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead the Wednesday or Friday afternoon session.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday or Friday afternoon session.
  - That leaves Lan and Olivia to lead the remaining morning session.
  
So, we can determine which sessions Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, and Lan/Olivia lead. That's a total of four lab assistants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The lab sessions are scheduled over three days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Each day has one morning and one afternoon session.
  The lab assistants are: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Working through the constraints, we can determine the following:
  * Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  * Lan and Olivia must lead sessions on different days.
  * Nessa must lead an afternoon session, which means she must lead a session on either Wednesday or Thursday.
  * Julio's session must be on Wednesday, since his session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the following assignments:
  * Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  * Kevin and Rebecca lead the Wednesday sessions (one in the morning and one in the afternoon).
  * Lan leads the Friday morning session.
  * Olivia leads the Friday afternoon session.
  * Nessa leads either the Wednesday afternoon session or the Thursday morning session.
  
This means we can determine the session assignments for 4 of the lab assistants (Julio, Kevin, Lan, and Olivia). We cannot determine the session assignments for Nessa or Rebecca, since they could be assigned to either of two possible sessions.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, Rebecca.
  The lab sessions are scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Each day has a morning and afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, we can infer some constraints on the other lab assistants and the sessions they lead.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six lab sessions, one per morning and one per afternoon on each of three days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, we can use the given constraints to determine the assignments of Kevin, Rebecca, Lan, Nessa, and Olivia.

Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday or Friday sessions. Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, Nessa cannot lead the Wednesday session. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Friday sessions. We know that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday afternoon, and Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning. This means that Lan cannot lead the Thursday morning session. Therefore, Lan must lead the Friday morning session. All of the sessions have been assigned, and we can determine the assignments for five of the lab assistants: 

Julio: Wednesday afternoon
Kevin: Friday morning
Rebecca: Friday afternoon
Lan: Friday morning
Olivia: Thursday morning

We cannot determine the assignment for Nessa, so the answer is A: one.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 3 days with 2 sessions on each day, for a total of 6 sessions.
  2. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Working through the constraints:
  1. There are only two sessions on Thursday, and Julio leads the afternoon session. Therefore, Olivia leads the morning session on Thursday.
  2. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. This means that Kevin and Rebecca can only lead the Wednesday or Friday sessions, and they must lead both sessions on the same day.
  3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. We know that Olivia leads the Thursday morning session, so Lan must lead the Wednesday morning or the Friday morning session.
  4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. We know that Nessa cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday afternoon or the Friday afternoon session.
  
Based on the above constraints, we can determine the following:
  - Wednesday morning must be led by either Lan or Rebecca.
  - Friday morning must be led by either Lan or Rebecca.
  - Wednesday afternoon must be led by Nessa.
  - Friday afternoon must be led by either Kevin or Rebecca.
  
Therefore, for a total of 4 lab assistants, we can determine which sessions they lead: Lan or Rebecca for Wednesday morning, Lan or Rebecca for Friday morning, Nessa for Wednesday afternoon, and Kevin or Rebecca for Friday afternoon.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  2. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  5. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Let's consider the possible schedule of lab assistants with their sessions:
Wednesday morning: 
Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, Rebecca

Wednesday afternoon: 
Rebecca, Olivia, Kevin, Nessa, Julio, Lan

Thursday morning: 
Lan, Nessa, Rebecca, Olivia, Kevin, Julio

Thursday afternoon: 
Nessa, Julio, Olivia, Kevin, Lan, Rebecca

Friday morning: 
Kevin, Olivia, Julio, Lan, Rebecca, Nessa

Friday afternoon: 
Olivia, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca, Julio, Kevin

If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can determine the sessions led by Nessa, Kevin, and Rebecca. 
Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and she hasn't led one yet, so it must be on Friday afternoon.
Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and one of their sessions must be on Thursday. The only available Thursday session is Thursday morning, so Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Thursday morning session together.

Therefore, for 3 of the other lab assistants (Nessa, Kevin, and Rebecca) we can determine which sessions they lead.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are 6 lab sessions: 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then:
    - Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
    - Lan cannot lead any session on Thursday.
    - Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday or Friday sessions.
    - Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and since Julio leads on Thursday afternoon, Nessa must lead on Wednesday or Friday afternoon.
    - There are 2 possible sessions left for Lan: Wednesday morning and Friday morning.
    - There are 2 possible sessions left for Nessa: Wednesday afternoon and Friday afternoon.
    
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, for Kevin, Rebecca, Lan, and Nessa, we can determine which sessions they lead. That's a total of 4 lab assistants.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the 4 walls has 2 paintings (upper and lower positions). So, 8 paintings in total.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
 
Analysis:
  - If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then that wall will have paintings by only two students (Franz and Greene). This violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. So, option A cannot be true.
  - If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall will have paintings by only two students (Franz and Hidalgo). This violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. So, option B cannot be true.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. So, if Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then both of Greene's paintings will be in the upper position, which violates the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it. So, option C cannot be true.
  - If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position and on the same wall as Hidalgo's watercolor. This is possible and does not violate any of the given conditions. So, option D can be true.
  - If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall will have paintings by only two students (Isaacs and Hidalgo). This violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. So, option E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in a lower position.
  If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in a lower position.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then it must be Wall 1 or Wall 3, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil. But this would mean that both Franz and Isaacs have paintings displayed on the same wall, which contradicts one of the given conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is (E) Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 4 walls in the exhibition room, and each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - Each of the 4 students will display exactly 2 paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - Franz and Isaacs cannot have their paintings displayed on the same wall.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Solution:
  Let's examine each choice:
  A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then that means Franz's oil must be displayed on another wall. This creates a problem because Greene's oil can only be displayed on the same wall as his/her own watercolor. So, this choice cannot be true.
  B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that means Franz's oil must also be on that same wall. This is possible, and it satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, this choice could be true.
  C: According to the given condition, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. This means Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
  D: There is no condition that contradicts Hidalgo's watercolor being displayed in a lower position. Therefore, this choice could be true.
  E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that means Isaacs's oil must be on another wall. But, since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, this creates a problem because Hidalgo's oil can only be displayed in the upper position of another wall. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
  
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The exhibition room has four walls, and two paintings are displayed on each wall in an upper and lower position.
  Each of the four art students will display exactly one oil and one watercolor painting.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Analysis:
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then that wall would have both paintings by Franz and Greene, which is not allowed.
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would have both paintings by Franz and Hidalgo, which is not allowed.
  If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then that would mean Franz's oil is displayed in the lower position, which is not allowed.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then that would mean Hidalgo's oil is displayed in the upper position, which is not allowed.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would have both paintings by Isaacs and Hidalgo, which is not allowed.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:

- There are four walls and each of them has one upper position and one lower position.
- Each of the four students has one oil and one watercolor painting.
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Analysis:
- Choice A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then that wall would have only the works of two students, which is not allowed. Therefore, this cannot be true.
- Choice B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would have the works of only two students, which is not allowed. Therefore, this cannot be true.
- Choice C: This is possible because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. 
- Choice D: This is possible because Hidalgo's watercolor can be displayed in the upper position, and Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
- Choice E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would have only the works of two students, which is not allowed. Therefore, this cannot be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student will display exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  Two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Solution:
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then one wall would have both paintings from two students and another wall would have only one student's paintings. This violates the second condition.
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then one wall would have both paintings from two students and another wall would have only one student's paintings. This violates the second condition.
  If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then it would be on the same wall as Franz's oil. This violates the third condition because the wall would have both paintings from two students.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then it would be on the same wall as Isaacs's oil. This violates the first condition because the wall would have only watercolors on it.
  Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil without violating any of the given conditions.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are 4 walls and each wall displays exactly 2 paintings.
  Each student displays exactly 1 oil painting and 1 watercolor painting.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Analysis:
  Since each wall displays exactly 2 paintings, there are a total of 8 paintings to be displayed. This means that each student displays 2 paintings. Since there are 4 students and no wall can have only one student's work displayed, each student must display a painting on 2 different walls. 
  From the given conditions, it can be inferred that Franz's oil painting is displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor painting. Therefore, Franz's watercolor painting cannot be displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil painting. 
  Similarly, since Isaacs's oil painting is displayed on wall 4, Isaacs's watercolor painting cannot be displayed on wall 4.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are four walls (1, 2, 3, and 4) and each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  Each of the four art students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.

Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil (A) or Hidalgo's oil (B), then that wall will have paintings by two students only, which is not allowed. This cannot be true.
  Greene's oil is displayed in a lower position, because his watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. So, (C) cannot be true.
  Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed in a lower position, because Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so (D) cannot be true.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so if Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, that wall will have paintings by two students only, which is not allowed. This cannot be true. So, (E) cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

  Each wall will have exactly two paintings - one in the upper position and the other in the lower position.
  No wall will have only watercolors.
  No wall will have the work of only one student.
  No wall will have both Franz's and Isaacs's paintings.
  Greene's watercolor is on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  Isaacs's oil is on the lower position of Wall 4.
Action: 
  Option A: If Franz's watercolor is on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Greene's watercolor must be on a different wall than the one with Franz's oil. This is possible because no wall should have only watercolors. Therefore, this can be true. 
  Option B: If Franz's watercolor is on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then the other two walls must have the works of only one student, which is not possible. Therefore, this cannot be true. 
  Option C: According to the given information, Greene's watercolor must be in the upper position of the wall where Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, this cannot be false. 
  Option D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be in an upper position, which is not possible. Therefore, this cannot be true. 
  Option E: If Isaacs's watercolor is on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then the other two walls must have the works of only one student, which is not possible. Therefore, this cannot be true. 
Therefore, the answer is Option B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert
  D: Kyle and Nina
  E: Olivia and Kyle
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  5. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

Solution:
- George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, he cannot be part of a pair that gives a report on Wednesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give a report in the afternoon. Therefore, they cannot be part of a pair that gives an afternoon report on Wednesday.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give a report on Wednesday. But if Nina's report is on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can't give a report on Wednesday.
- Therefore, if Nina gives a report, then she can only be part of a pair that gives a report on Monday or Tuesday. Also, if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give a report on Wednesday.
- If Helen and Irving give a report on Wednesday, then they can only be part of a pair that gives a report on Monday.
- Therefore, the pairs of students who must give reports on Wednesday are:
  * Nina and one of the following: George, Lenore, Kyle, or Olivia
  * Helen and Irving
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  From the given information, we can infer that George will give his report on Tuesday, which means he will not give his report on Monday or Wednesday. If Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day (either Tuesday or Wednesday). So, George cannot give a report on the same day as Helen or Irving. Also, if Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. Hence, if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then she cannot give a report on Wednesday. 

  A: George and Lenore - There are no restrictions on George or Lenore. They can give their reports on any day. So, this pair doesn't have to give reports on Wednesday.
  B: Helen and Nina - If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. So, this pair doesn't have to give reports on Wednesday. In case Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then this pair can't give their reports on the same day.
  C: Irving and Robert - There are no restrictions on Irving or Robert. They can give their reports on any day. So, this pair doesn't have to give reports on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle and Nina - Same as option B, if Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Kyle and Olivia must give their reports on Wednesday. So, this pair doesn't have to give reports on Wednesday. In case Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then this pair can't give their reports on the same day.
  E: Olivia and Kyle - If Kyle gives his report on Monday, then Olivia must give her report on Wednesday. If Kyle gives his report on Wednesday, then Olivia must give her report on Monday. So, this pair has to give reports on the same day, but we cannot determine if it has to be on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports.
  2. The reports will be given during three consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  4. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  5. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  6. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Let's check each option:
  A: There is no information about George and Lenore. So, this is not the correct answer.
  B: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports. Therefore, Helen and Nina must give reports on Wednesday. So, this is not the correct answer.
  C: Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. So, this is not the correct answer.
  D: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports. So, if Kyle gives a report on Wednesday, then he must give it with Helen and Irving. Therefore, Kyle and Nina must give reports on Wednesday. This is the correct answer.
  E: Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. So, this is not the correct answer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. There are eight students in the seminar.
  2. Exactly six of them will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
  3. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  4. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  5. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  6. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Analysis:
  1. If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
  2. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, because if she does, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
  3. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
  4. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday, because if she does, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
  5. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  6. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on the same day.
  7. Therefore, if Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
To determine which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday, we can start by analyzing the students who have a possible presence on Wednesday. If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. Since there are only two reports on Wednesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, then Kyle and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina does not give a report, then the answer must be between George, Helen, Irving, and Nina. Now, let's check the cases where Nina gives a report. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means that George and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, and George and Lenore must give reports on Monday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then George and Lenore must give reports on Monday, and Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, the only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday, regardless of whether Nina gives a report or not, are George and Lenore. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Exactly six students will give oral reports on three consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
- Exactly two reports will be given each day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon).
- George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- We need to find a pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.

Solution:
- We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
- We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, they must give their reports in the morning.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday and Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give reports on Monday and Tuesday.
- We need to find a pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other. This means that these two students cannot give reports on Monday or Tuesday. 
- Based on the above conditions, the only pair of students who cannot give reports on Monday or Tuesday are Olivia and Robert. Therefore, if they give reports on the same day as each other, they must give reports on Wednesday.
 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  5. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

Working through the conditions, we know that George must give his report on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then both Irving and Helen must give their reports on Tuesday. This means that neither Irving nor Helen can give their reports on Wednesday, which means that Nina's report must be on Wednesday. Then, Robert and Olivia must give their reports on Monday. Further, Kyle and Lenore must give their reports on Tuesday. This leaves only Helen and Irving to give their reports on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day.
  5. Exactly six students will give reports over three consecutive days.
  
Using condition #2, we can deduce that Olivia and Robert will have to give their reports in the morning. 
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday (per condition #3), which means the other two reports on Tuesday must be Olivia in the morning and George in the afternoon (per condition #1). This leaves Lenore and Kyle for Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give her report on Monday, so she must give it on Wednesday. This means that Helen and Irving do not need to give a report on Tuesday, so the only two reports on Tuesday will be Olivia in the morning and George in the afternoon. Therefore, Helen and Irving must give their reports on Monday, along with either Lenore and Kyle. Therefore, if Lenore and Kyle give their reports on Monday, then the pair who must give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Nina.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly six students will give reports during three consecutive days.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - George can only give his report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If we have George on Tuesday, then we must have two more students giving their report on Tuesday, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. In this case, we have only two students left to give reports, which will be on Wednesday. If Nina does not give her report on Monday, then she will give her report on Wednesday and we must have two more students to give their reports on Tuesday, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. In this case, we have only one student left to give a report, which will be on Wednesday.

  A: It is not possible for George and Lenore to give reports on Wednesday since George can only give his report on Tuesday.
  B: If Helen and Nina give their reports on the same day, they can give their reports on Monday or Wednesday. Therefore, this is not a definitive pair for Wednesday.
  C: If Irving and Robert give their reports on the same day, they can give their reports on Monday or Wednesday. Therefore, this is not a definitive pair for Wednesday.
  D: If Kyle and Nina give their reports on the same day, they can give their reports on Monday or Wednesday. Therefore, this is not a definitive pair for Wednesday.
  E: It is not possible for Olivia and Kyle to give reports on Wednesday since we only have one student left to give a report on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after the day Nina gives the report), Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Reasoning:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday, therefore he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  2. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after the day Nina gives the report), Helen and Irving must both give reports. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, otherwise, Helen and Irving will both give reports on Wednesday, which is not allowed.
  3. If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving can give reports on any day except Tuesday.
  4. Therefore, the only possible day for Nina to give a report is Monday.
  5. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  6. Therefore, the only possible pairs of students who must give reports on Wednesday are George and Lenore or Olivia and Kyle, since they are the only remaining students.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - There are seven businesses that will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.
Analysis: 
  - Since the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy cannot be in space 2, and one of the restaurants cannot be in space 1 or space 2.
  - If the pharmacy is not in space 1, it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 1.
  - If the optometrist is in space 1, then the pharmacy cannot be next to it, so the veterinarian must be in space 3. But this creates a problem because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, which would mean that the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6. This eliminates choices D and E.
  - If the veterinarian is in space 1, then the pharmacy must be in space 2. This eliminates choice B. 
  - We are left with choices A and C.
  - If the optometrist is in space 5, then the veterinarian must be in space 6, the pharmacy must be in space 7, and the two restaurants must be in spaces 3 and 4 (in some order). This satisfies all the constraints. 
  - If a restaurant is in space 3, then the other restaurant must be in space 6 or 7 to satisfy the constraint that they must be separated by at least two other businesses. But this is not possible because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This eliminates choice C.
Conclusion: 
  The only choice that could be true if the shoe store is in space 2 is A. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer("A")'.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row numbered from 1 to 7.
  - There are seven businesses: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian. Each business will occupy one space.
  - Constraints:
    1. Pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other end.
    2. Two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
    3. Pharmacy must be next to either optometrist or veterinarian.
    4. Toy store cannot be next to veterinarian.

If the shoe store is in space 2, the only possibilities for the businesses in spaces 1 and 3 are the pharmacy and a restaurant (in some order). 
Knowledge:
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then one of the restaurants must be in space 7.
  - If a restaurant is in space 3, then the other restaurant cannot be in spaces 4 or 5.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

A: The optometrist cannot be in space 5 because the pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other end. Moreover, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
B: If the pharmacy is in space 1, then one of the restaurants must be in space 7, which is not possible. Therefore, the pharmacy is not in space 1.
C: If a restaurant is in space 3, then the other restaurant cannot be in spaces 4 or 5. Therefore, it is possible for a restaurant to be in space 3.
D: If the toy store is in space 6, then the veterinarian must be in space 5, which is not possible because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
E: If the veterinarian is in space 4, then the pharmacy must be in space 3, and one of the restaurants must be in space 7, which is not possible.

The only possibility is that the pharmacy is in space 7 and one of the restaurants is in space 1.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:

  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7.
  
Elimination:
  A: If the shoe store is in space 2, then space 5 must be occupied by either the optometrist or the veterinarian, but neither of them can be next to the pharmacy, which must be in space 1 or 7. Therefore, the optometrist cannot be in space 5. 
  B: If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7. Therefore, the pharmacy could be in space 1.
  C: If the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses, then a restaurant cannot be in space 3 because it would be adjacent to both the shoe store and the pharmacy. Therefore, a restaurant cannot be in space 3.
  D: If the shoe store is in space 2, then the toy store cannot be in space 6 because it would be adjacent to the veterinarian. Therefore, the toy store cannot be in space 6.
  E: If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7. Therefore, the veterinarian could be in space 4.

Action: Answer("B")

  - The restaurant must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be in space 2.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 1, 2, 3, or 7.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or 1.
  
Answer:
  Option A: The optometrist is in space 5. - Not possible because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
  Option B: The pharmacy is in space 1. - Possible because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and it must be next to the shoe store. 
  Option C: A restaurant is in space 3. - Not possible because two restaurants cannot be together and the restaurant must be at the other end of the row from the pharmacy. 
  Option D: The toy store is in space 6. - Not possible because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
  Option E: The veterinarian is in space 4. - Possible because it is not next to the toy store and it is next to the pharmacy. 

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("E")

  If the pharmacy is in space 1, it must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. If it is next to the optometrist, the veterinarian must be in space 2, and the toy store cannot be in space 3. If the veterinarian is in space 2, the toy store can be in space 3.
  If a restaurant is in space 3, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 nor space 7, and the other restaurant cannot be in space 5. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 2 or space 6. If the pharmacy is in space 2, the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 1, and the toy store cannot be in space 3. If the pharmacy is in space 6, the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 7, and the toy store cannot be in space 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - Seven businesses (an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian) will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.
  
  A: The optometrist can only be in space 1, 3, or 5. If the optometrist is in space 5, the pharmacy would have to be in space 6 or 7, which violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the optometrist cannot be in space 5. If the optometrist is in space 1, the veterinarian would have to be in space 2, which violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the optometrist cannot be in space 1. If the optometrist is in space 3, the pharmacy would have to be in space 1, which violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the optometrist cannot be in space 3. Therefore, A is not true.
  
  B: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be in space 2. Therefore, B is not true.
  
  C: The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, if there is a restaurant in space 3, the other restaurant must be in space 6 or 7. However, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be in space 7 if there is a restaurant in space 3. Therefore, C is not true.
  
  D: The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, if the shoe store is in space 2, the veterinarian must be in space 4 and the toy store must be in space 6. Therefore, D could be true.
  
  E: The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. However, if the veterinarian is in space 4, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or space 7 (since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row), and it cannot be in space 2 (since the shoe store is in space 2) or space 3 (since there cannot be a restaurant in space 3). Therefore, E is not true.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row numbered from 1 to 7.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.
  
Analysis:
  - The pharmacy must be at one of the ends, so it can only be in space 1 or space 7. But it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the veterinarian can be in space 1 and the pharmacy in space 2 or the optometrist can be in space 7 and the pharmacy in space 6.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, they can be located in spaces 3 and 7 or 1 and 5.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or space 1.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 2, and the pharmacy is in space 6, then the optometrist must be in space 5, the veterinarian in space 1, one restaurant in space 3, the other restaurant in space 7, and the toy store in space 4.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be located at opposite ends of the row. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. The shoe store is in space 2.
A: There are only two spaces between the restaurant that must be at one end of the row and space 5, so the optometrist cannot be in space 5.
B: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, which means it cannot be in space 2. 
C: The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so a restaurant cannot be in space 3.
D: The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, and space 6 is next to space 7, which is where the veterinarian could be located, so the toy store cannot be in space 6.
E: The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The optometrist cannot be in space 1, so the pharmacy must be in space 1, and the veterinarian must be in space 3. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces numbered 1-7 in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.
Analysis:
  - Since the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy cannot be there.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and since it cannot be in space 2, it must be in space 1 or space 7.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row. Since the pharmacy is in space 1 or space 7, the other restaurant must be in space 5 or space 6.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the optometrist and the veterinarian must be in space 3 and space 4 in some order.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 7.
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if the shoe store is in space 2, the toy store must be in space 6, which means none of the other choices could be true.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.
  
Analysis:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, but it cannot be in space 2 or 6 (because it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian).
  - One restaurant must be at the other end of the row, but it cannot be in space 1 or 7 (because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row).
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, which means that they must be in spaces 3 and 5 or spaces 4 and 6.
  - The toy store cannot be in space 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (because it cannot be next to the veterinarian).
  - This means that the toy store must be in space 7.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are four lectures on different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each lecture is given by one of four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
  - Each historian gives one lecture on a different topic.
  - The lectures are given one at a time.
  - The schedule of lectures is subject to the following constraints:
    - Oil paintings and watercolors must be earlier than lithographs.
    - Farley's lecture must be earlier than oil paintings lecture.
    - Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, there must be one lecture before it and two lectures after it.
  
  A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley's lecture must be first, and Holden's lecture must be second. But this would mean that oil paintings lecture and watercolors lecture are both earlier than lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint. Therefore, Farley could not give the watercolors lecture.
  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be first, and Holden's lecture must be second. This satisfies all the constraints and is a valid schedule. Therefore, Garcia could give the oil paintings lecture.
  C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be first, and Farley's lecture must be second. But this would mean that oil paintings lecture and watercolors lecture are both earlier than lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint. Therefore, Garcia could not give the sculptures lecture.
  D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Farley's lecture must be first, and Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be third and fourth (in some order). But this would mean that oil paintings lecture and watercolors lecture are both earlier than lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint. Therefore, Holden could not give the sculptures lecture.
  E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then Farley's lecture must be first, and Holden's lecture must be second. But this would mean that oil paintings lecture and watercolors lecture are both earlier than lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint. Therefore, Jiang could not give the lithographs lecture.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
- Each art historian gives a lecture on one of the following topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
- Each historian gives a lecture on a different topic.
- The lectures will be given one at a time.
- The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

If the watercolors lecture is third, then we know that the order of the first two lectures is either oil paintings and sculptures or sculptures and oil paintings. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture is either first or second.

A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley's lecture must be first, which violates the constraint that the watercolors lecture is third. Therefore, A is not possible.

B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then the order of the first two lectures is sculptures and oil paintings. Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, so Holden's lecture must be first. Jiang's lecture must be last, so the order of the lectures is Holden, sculptures; Garcia, oil paintings; Farley, watercolors; Jiang, lithographs. This order satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, B could be true.

C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the first two lectures is oil paintings and sculptures. Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, so Holden's lecture must be first. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture must be second. But this violates the constraint that the watercolors lecture is third, so C is not possible.

D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the first two lectures is oil paintings and sculptures. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture must be first. This violates the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so D is not possible.

E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the order of the first two lectures is oil paintings and sculptures. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture must be first. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden's lecture must be second. This violates the constraint that the watercolors lecture is third, so E is not possible.

Therefore, the answer is B) Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
  - Each historian will give a lecture on one of four topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time in the order: watercolors, sculptures, oil paintings, and lithographs.
  - There are three constraints:
    1. Oil paintings and watercolors must be earlier than lithographs.
    2. Farley's lecture must be earlier than oil paintings.
    3. Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.

If watercolors is third, then we can infer two things:
- The first lecture must be either oil paintings or sculptures.
- The second lecture must be the other one between oil paintings and sculptures.

Let's go through each choice:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
    This is not possible because watercolors is third, and Farley must give a lecture earlier than oil paintings, which means he can only give the first lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
    This is possible because oil paintings must be the second lecture if watercolors is third.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
    This is not possible because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, and Holden cannot give the first lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
    This is possible because sculptures must be the first lecture if oil paintings is the second lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
    This is possible because lithographs must be the last lecture.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are four lectures to be given: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  If the watercolors lecture is third, that means the order of the lectures is one of the following:
    1. Lithographs, oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures
    2. Oil paintings, lithographs, watercolors, sculptures
    3. Oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs, sculptures
    4. Oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures, lithographs
    5. Watercolors, oil paintings, lithographs, sculptures
    6. Watercolors, oil paintings, sculptures, lithographs
    7. Watercolors, sculptures, oil paintings, lithographs
    8. Sculptures, watercolors, oil paintings, lithographs
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then we can eliminate choices A, D, and E since they all have lectures scheduled before the watercolors lecture. 
  From the possible orders listed above, we can see that choice B is valid: Garcia can give the oil paintings lecture in orders 3, 4, and 6. 
  Choice C is not valid since there is no order that has Garcia giving the sculptures lecture. 
  Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - There are four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - The watercolors lecture is third, so it is not the first or second lecture.

Eliminating choices:
  - Choice A is not possible because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, and the watercolors lecture is already third.
  - Choice C and D are not possible because of the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - Choice E is not possible because the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.

Action: Answer("B")  
The only remaining option is B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. This is possible because the watercolors lecture is third, so the first two lectures could be sculptures and oil paintings in either order. Then, the last two lectures could be watercolors and lithographs in either order, satisfying all of the given constraints.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 4 lectures in total: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - No two art historians can give a lecture on the same topic.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.

Action: 
  If the watercolors lecture is third, it means that only the lectures on sculptures and lithographs are left.
  Since Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture (which is not available anyway).
  Since Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's and Jiang's lectures, and there are only sculptures and lithographs lectures left, Holden must give the sculptures lecture and Garcia and Jiang must give the remaining two lectures.
  Therefore, the possible options are:
  - Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. (Not possible)
  - Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. (Not possible)
  - Holden gives the sculptures lecture. (Possible)
  - Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. (Possible)
  So, the answer is either D or E. 
  Action: Answer("D or E (both)")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures on different topics.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different topic.
  - The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints:
    - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, it means that the first two lectures are either oil paintings and sculptures or sculptures and oil paintings.
  
Analysis:
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then the lithographs lecture must be the last lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which means that Farley's lecture must be the first lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, which means that Holden's lecture must be the second lecture, and Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be the third and the fourth lectures, but it is not known which one of them will be third or fourth.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  We have four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
  We have four different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  Constraint 1: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Constraint 2: Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Constraint 3: Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

Since the watercolors lecture is third, this means that the order of the lectures is either:  
1- oil paintings, 2- sculptures, 3- watercolors, 4- lithographs or  
1- sculptures, 2- oil paintings, 3- watercolors, 4- lithographs.

A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. This is possible, as the watercolors lecture is third and Farley's lecture can be first or second.
B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. This is not possible, because according to Constraint 2, Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. This is possible, as the watercolors lecture is third and Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture.
D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. This is possible, as the watercolors lecture is third and Holden's lecture can be first or second.
E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. This is possible, as the watercolors lecture is third and according to Constraint 1, the lithographs lecture must be last.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The art historians are Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
  - There are four topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives a lecture on a different topic, one at a time.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures could be:
  1. Farley's lecture (either lithographs or oil paintings)
  2. Holden's lecture (either oil paintings or sculptures)
  3. Watercolors lecture (given by either Garcia or Jiang)
  4. Lithographs lecture (given by the remaining historian)

Option A is not possible because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
Option B is possible because the oil paintings lecture can be given by either Farley or Holden.
Option C is not possible because Garcia's lecture must be later than Holden's lecture.
Option D is possible because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture.
Option E is possible because the lithographs lecture can be given by the remaining historian.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are four lectures, each on a different topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time and each art historian will give a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures must be one of the following:

1. Oil Paintings, Sculptures, Watercolors, Lithographs
2. Sculptures, Oil Paintings, Watercolors, Lithographs
3. Oil Paintings, Watercolors, Sculptures, Lithographs

A. Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture since it is already given by someone else. 
B. If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Holden would have to give the sculptures lecture (based on the possible orders above), but this would violate the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. 
C. Garcia could give the sculptures lecture. This is possible based on the orders above. 
D. Holden could give the sculptures lecture. This is possible based on the orders above. 
E. Jiang would have to give the lithographs lecture.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must also be selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, F, G, L, and M are the possible remaining candidates. This statement does not provide any information about the selection of G.
  B: If L is selected, the remaining chemists are K and M, and the remaining botanists are F and G. However, this statement does not provide any information about the selection of F.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be either K, L, or M. This statement does not provide any information about the selection of F or G.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, they can be either KL, KM, or LM. In the first two cases, F and G are the possible remaining candidates. However, this statement does not provide any information about the selection of G.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, they can be either KL, KM, or LM. In the first two cases, F and G are the possible remaining candidates. If KL is selected, then F and G must be selected. This statement provides information about the selection of G.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("B")

If L is selected, then at most one botanist can be selected. So, F cannot be selected. Thus, (B) is true. 

(A) If K is selected, then G can still be selected. So, (A) is not necessarily true.

(C) The question states that the panel must include at least one chemist, so it does not have to be exactly one chemist. Thus, (C) is not necessarily true.

(D) If exactly two chemists are selected, they could be any two of the three chemists. So, (D) is not necessarily true.

(E) If exactly two chemists are selected, they could be any two of the three chemists. So, (E) is not necessarily true.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two scientists must be a botanist and a chemist. Since there are three botanists and three chemists, one of each type can be selected, and there are three possible combinations for the panel:
  1. F, K, and P
  2. G, L, and P
  3. H, L, and P
  
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. For example, if F, K, and P are selected, then G could still be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. For example, if H, L, and P are selected, then F could still be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This is not necessarily true. For example, if F, L, and P are selected, then K could still be selected.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. This is true. For example, if K, L, and P are selected, then F cannot be selected because more than one botanist would be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. For example, if F, K, and P are selected, then G could still be selected.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist, and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist. 
  
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected. If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, if K is selected, G must be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one botanist.
  
  If L is selected, then F can still be selected. Therefore, if L is selected, F can also be selected.
  
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be either K or M. We cannot determine which one of them must be selected based on the given information.
  
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then it is possible that F, G, and P are selected. Therefore, D and E are not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, meaning that the panel must have at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. So, if F is selected, at most one zoologist can be selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected. So, if F is selected, K cannot be selected, and vice versa.
  - K and M cannot both be selected. So, if K is selected, M cannot be selected, and vice versa.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. So, if M is not selected, then P and R cannot be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R are not selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, and G is selected, then F must also be selected since there must be at least one botanist on the panel. This contradicts the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, if K is selected, G cannot be selected. This statement is true.
  B: If L is selected, then both F and G can be selected since there must be at least one botanist on the panel. This statement is false.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, then it can either be K, L, or M. This statement is false.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then it can either be KL, KM, or LM. F can still be selected even if exactly two chemists are selected, as long as there is at least one botanist on the panel. This statement is false.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then it can either be KL, KM, or LM. G can still be selected even if exactly two chemists are selected, as long as there is at least one botanist on the panel. This statement is false.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist)
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - We know that P is the only zoologist selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. 
     We don't have enough information to determine if this statement is true or false based on the given conditions.
  
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
     We don't have enough information to determine if this statement is true or false based on the given conditions.
  
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
     This statement is false. We can select F, P, and K to satisfy the conditions.
  
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
     This statement is true. If P is the only zoologist selected, and we need at least one botanist, then we can only select one chemist. If we select L and M, then we cannot select any botanist because we cannot select more than one botanist and we cannot select F because K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, F cannot be selected.
  
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
     This statement is false. We can select F, P, and K to satisfy the conditions.
     
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R are not selected.
  
Action: Answer("B")
  
Explanation:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R are not selected. Therefore, the panel consists of one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. Because F and G are both botanists, at most one of them can be selected. If L is selected, then K and M cannot be selected, and therefore, F and G must be selected. However, if F is selected then K cannot be selected, which violates the given conditions. Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected. Answer B states this fact. None of the other options are necessarily true.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as botanist. 
    If G is selected as botanist, then K and M cannot be selected as chemists.
    If F is selected as botanist, then at most one zoologist can be selected. 
    If M is selected as chemist, then both P and R must be selected as zoologists.
    
Analysis:
  - A: If K is selected, F can still be selected. This option is not a must.
  - B: If L is selected, F can still be selected. This option is not a must.
  - C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This option is a valid must. 
  - D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F can still be selected. This option is not a must.
  - E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G can still be selected. This option is not a must.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F, G, H, K, L, or M must be selected as a botanist or chemist.
  
Analysis:
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected, because F and K cannot both be selected.
  If L is selected, then F can still be selected because there is no restriction on selecting L and F.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, then it could be either K, L, or M, because all three are available options. 
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then F, G, or H must be selected as a botanist, because if two botanists are selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. However, there is no restriction on selecting F or G along with two chemists.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then G can still be selected because there is no restriction on selecting G with two chemists.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected.

Elimination:
  A: We cannot determine if this is true based on the given information.
  B: If P is the only zoologist selected, then F must be selected to satisfy the requirement of having at least one botanist. If L is selected, then K cannot be selected due to the constraint F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, B must be true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be any of K, L, or M. Therefore, C is not necessarily true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, they could be any combination of K, L, and M. Therefore, D is not necessarily true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, they could be any combination of K, L, and M. Therefore, E is not necessarily true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To satisfy the conditions:
- Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
- Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn are in the same sales zone.
- Stuckey and Udall are in the same sales zone.
- There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as either Parra or Stuckey because they are already assigned to work in the same sales zone as someone else. Therefore, the answer is either C: Stuckey or D: Tiao.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs seven sales representatives who work in three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone with, we need to find the sales representative who is already in the same sales zone as Quinn. Then we can eliminate that sales representative as a potential answer. 

From the given information, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so they cannot be the answer. 
We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so they cannot be the answer. 

We don't know which zone Kim and Mahr work in, so they could potentially be the answer. 

Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it must be the case that at least three sales representatives work in Zone 3. 

Thus, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as:
Action: Answer("B") Mahr.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  From the given conditions:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  We don't know which sales representatives work in Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3 yet.
  
  Considering the conditions that involve Quinn:
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Quinn can't work in the same sales zone as Parra. 
  
  Therefore, Quinn can't work in Zone 1 if Parra works there. Also, Quinn can't work in the sales zone where Parra and Tiao work together because Tiao is not an option for Quinn's sales zone. We can eliminate A and D.
  
  We also know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 3, but not both. If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn can't work in the same sales zone as Stuckey and Udall. If Tiao works in Zone 3, then Quinn can't work in the same sales zone as Udall. Therefore, we can eliminate E and C.
  
  The only option left is B, Mahr. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Exactly one sales representative among Parra and Tiao works in Zone 1.
  Exactly one sales representative among Tiao and Udall works in Zone 2.
  
Reasoning: 
  Since Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, we can eliminate Parra from the choices. Therefore, we need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone. 
  If Stuckey is working in Zone 3, then Udall would be working in Zone 3 as well. Therefore, one sales representative among Parra and Tiao would be working in Zone 1, and the other would be working in Zone 2, which means that there would be two sales representatives working in Zone 2. However, the problem states that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Stuckey cannot be working in Zone 3. This means that Stuckey and Udall are working in Zone 2. Since Tiao cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall, Tiao must be working in Zone 1 and Parra must be working in Zone 3. This leaves Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra. 
  If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Udall is in Zone 2.
  If Udall is in Zone 2, then Tiao is in Zone 3. 
  If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao is in Zone 3.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Parra or Tiao, but not both, works in Zone 1.
  2. Tiao or Udall, but not both, works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  5. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, which is not possible as per condition 3. 
If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Udall also works in Zone 2, which is not possible as per condition 2.
Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are exactly three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
To determine the answer to this question, we need to consider each option and see if Quinn can work in the same sales zone with them. We know that Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra. We also know that Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 3, and either Kim or Mahr must work in Zone 2.

Option A: Kim - There is no reason why Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim. This option is not correct.
Option B: Mahr - There is no reason why Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr. This option is not correct.
Option C: Stuckey - We know that Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey. This is the correct answer.
Option D: Tiao - We know that Tiao works in Zone 3. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao. This option is not correct.
Option E: Udall - We know that Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall. This option is also a correct answer.

Action: Answer("C") or Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We are given that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We are given that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We are given that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We are given that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To determine which sales representative Quinn CANNOT work with, let's consider the options:
  A: We do not have any information about Kim's sales zone, so it is possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as Kim.
  B: We do not have any information about Mahr's sales zone, so it is possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as Mahr.
  C: We do not have any information about Stuckey's sales zone, so it is possible for Quinn to work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  D: If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3 and Quinn must work in Zone 3 as well, since more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao. 
  E: If Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in Zone 1 and Parra must work in Zone 3. In this scenario, Quinn must work in Zone 3 as well, since more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  We need to find a sales representative who cannot be in the same sales zone as Quinn. 
  
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra also works in Zone 1. But Parra and Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as each other. So, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1, and Parra works in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2. 
  
  If Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey also works in Zone 2. But Stuckey and Udall cannot work in the same sales zone as each other. So, Udall cannot work in Zone 2, and Stuckey works in Zone 2. Therefore, there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means that there are at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3. 
  
  From the above deductions, we can conclude that Kim, Mahr, and Udall work in Zone 3. And Quinn works in the same sales zone as either Kim or Mahr, but not both. Therefore, the sales representative that Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as is Udall.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
Choices:
  A: Julio, Nessa
  B: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  E: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants available for the sessions: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  The lab sessions are scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Each day has one morning session and one afternoon session.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
  If Kevin's session is on Thursday, then Nessa's session is on Friday. Therefore, Julio's session is on Wednesday, and Olivia's session is on Thursday or Friday. Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Lan must lead the Thursday morning session. Thus, the lab assistants available to lead the Thursday afternoon session are Nessa and Rebecca.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are two lab sessions per day for three days (total of 6 sessions).
  - We are trying to find out who can lead the Thursday afternoon session assuming that Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that Nessa's session must be in the afternoon and that Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's.
  - Therefore, Kevin's session must be on Wednesday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Thursday afternoon.
  - We also know that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Olivia's session must be on Wednesday morning and Lan's session must be on Thursday morning.
  - We also know that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning.
  - We are trying to find out who can lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  - We know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so the lab assistant for the Thursday afternoon session must be Nessa.
  - The only lab assistant who hasn't been assigned yet is Rebecca, so she must lead the Friday morning session.
  - This leaves Kevin to lead the Thursday morning session and Julio to lead the Wednesday afternoon session.
  
Action: Answer("A") - Julio and Nessa.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then they meet on Thursday and Friday, not on Wednesday. 
  Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon and Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Thursday.
  Therefore, on Thursday afternoon, either Julio or Lan can lead the session. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, that means Kevin and Rebecca should be leading the sessions on Wednesday and Nessa should be leading an afternoon session on Thursday or Friday. This means that Lan and Olivia are paired to lead the other session on the day Nessa is not leading.
  Thus, we have Kevin and Rebecca leading on Wednesday, Julio and Olivia leading on Friday, and Lan and Nessa leading on Thursday. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants available.
  There are two lab sessions on Thursday.
  Only one lab session can be led by each lab assistant.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's:
    - Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
    - Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Thursday.
    - This means that Lan and Olivia must lead sessions on Wednesday.
    - Also, Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday morning.
    
  Possible candidates to lead the Thursday afternoon session are:
    - Julio (if his session is on Thursday morning)
    - Kevin or Rebecca (if their session is on Thursday afternoon)
    - Nessa (if her session is on Friday afternoon)
    
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  
Approach:
  From the given information, we know that Kevin's session must be held either on Wednesday or Thursday, and Nessa's session must be held either on Thursday or Friday. If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be held on Wednesday and Nessa's on Thursday. This means that Nessa is leading an afternoon session on Thursday. Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, neither of them can lead the Thursday afternoon session. Thus, either Julio, Kevin, or Rebecca must lead the Thursday afternoon session.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session has to be on Thursday morning or Wednesday afternoon and Nessa's session has to be on Thursday afternoon or Friday afternoon.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  Based on the given constraints, Julio's session cannot be on Thursday afternoon or Friday afternoon. Therefore, Julio cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because Olivia cannot lead a session on Thursday and Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia. Kevin's session has to be on Thursday morning or Wednesday afternoon. If Kevin's session is on Wednesday afternoon, then Nessa's session would be on Thursday afternoon, which violates the constraint that Kevin's and Rebecca's sessions are on the same day. Therefore, Kevin's session is on Thursday morning and Nessa's session is on Thursday afternoon. This means Julio and Nessa are available to lead the Thursday afternoon session. Hence, the answer is A.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  6. There are six lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. This means that Lan and Olivia cannot lead Friday morning session. Therefore, either Julio or Rebecca must lead Friday morning session. According to the rule 1, if Rebecca leads Friday morning session, then Kevin must lead Friday afternoon session. Therefore, Julio must lead Thursday afternoon session. So, the answer is A: Julio, Nessa. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are 6 lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
  3. Each lab assistant must lead exactly one lab session.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  6. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  7. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  8. If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, that means that Kevin's session can only be on Thursday morning and Nessa's session can only be on Thursday afternoon. 

We need to find which lab assistants could lead the Thursday afternoon session. We know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and since her session is on Thursday, we know that the only available afternoon session is on Thursday. Therefore, we need to find which lab assistants could lead a session on Thursday and are not already excluded by the given constraints.

Option A: Julio and Nessa cannot both lead a session on Thursday because Julio must lead his session on an earlier day than Olivia. Therefore, option A is not correct.

Option B: Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead any session on Thursday because they must lead sessions that meet on the same day, which is not Thursday. Therefore, option B is not correct.

Option C: This option includes all the lab assistants that are not excluded by the given constraints. Nessa must lead an afternoon session on Thursday, and Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, which can only be Wednesday or Friday. Therefore, they could both lead a session on Thursday. Option C is correct.

Option D: This option includes all the lab assistants, but Julio cannot lead a session on Thursday because his session must meet on an earlier day than Olivia's. Therefore, option D is not correct.

Option E: This option includes all the lab assistants, but Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, and since their sessions are on Wednesday and Friday, respectively, they cannot both lead a session on Thursday. Therefore, option E is not correct.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - There are six lab assistants, but we don't know which assistant is leading which session.
  - The Thursday afternoon session can be led by any lab assistant except for Lan and Olivia.
  
We know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then we can deduce that Nessa's session must be on Friday, and Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Wednesday or Thursday. Since Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session, we can eliminate them as options for the Thursday afternoon session. Additionally, since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, we can eliminate Lan as an option for the Thursday afternoon session, since we know that Olivia's session must be on a different day. This leaves us with Julio, Nessa, and Rebecca as possible options.

  - Yardsign is performed in the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must be in slot 3 and Zircon must be in slot 2.
  - Therefore, Wellspring must be in slot 1 or 2 because Wellspring and Zircon perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The six slots at a benefit concert are numbered slot one through slot six.
  - The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then only one of the following orderings is valid:
  1. Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Yardsign, Uneasy
  2. Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Yardsign, Xpert, Uneasy

Action: Answer("B") 
  - If we look at the valid orderings, we see that Wellspring can perform in slot three.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will fill six numbered slots (slot one through slot six).
  - Constraints: 
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign:
    - Vegemite cannot be in slot one (otherwise, Zircon cannot be in a later slot than Vegemite and Yardsign cannot be in a first three slot).
    - Yardsign cannot be in slot three (otherwise, Wellspring cannot be in an earlier slot than Xpert and Zircon).
    - Therefore, Yardsign must be in slot one or slot two. 
  
Action: Answer("B") 
If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, Wellspring could perform in slot three, which is the earliest slot that satisfies the constraints.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. The order of the slots is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (earliest to latest).
  2. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. 
  3. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  4. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  5. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  6. If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon must perform in slot 2 or slot 3 and Yardsign must perform in slot 1.
  
  A: If Wellspring performs in slot 2, then it means Zircon performs in slot 3 or 4 (Constraint 3). But, if Zircon performs in slot 3, then it means Yardsign performs in slot 1 which is not possible (Constraint 5). So, Wellspring cannot perform in slot 2.
  
  B: If Wellspring performs in slot 3, then it means Zircon performs in slot 4 or 5 (Constraint 3). If Zircon performs in slot 4, then it means Yardsign performs in slot 1 which is not possible (Constraint 5). So, Zircon must perform in slot 5 and Yardsign must perform in slot 1. Then, Wellspring can perform in slot 3.
  
  C: If Wellspring performs in slot 4, then it means Zircon performs in slot 5 or 6 (Constraint 3). But, if Zircon performs in slot 5, then it means Yardsign performs in slot 1 which is not possible (Constraint 5). So, Wellspring cannot perform in slot 4.
  
  D: If Wellspring performs in slot 5, then it means Zircon performs in slot 6 (Constraint 3). But, if Zircon performs in slot 6, then it means Yardsign performs in slot 1 which is not possible (Constraint 5). So, Wellspring cannot perform in slot 5.
  
  E: If Wellspring performs in slot 6, then it means Zircon performs in slot 5 (Constraint 3). But, if Zircon performs in slot 5, then it means Yardsign performs in slot 1 which is not possible (Constraint 5). So, Wellspring cannot perform in slot 6.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:

  4. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  5. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  6. If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3.

Analysis:
  1. Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  2. Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, so they can perform in slot 4, 5 or 6.
  3. The remaining bands are Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, and Zircon.
  4. Vegemite must perform in slot 1 or 2.
  5. Xpert must perform in slot 6.
  6. Wellspring and Zircon can perform in slots 2, 3, or 4.
  7. If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon must perform in slot 1 or 2.
  8. If Zircon performs in slot 1, then Wellspring cannot perform in slot 2. If Zircon performs in slot 2, then Wellspring cannot perform in slot 3. Therefore, if Zircon performs in slot 1 or 2, then the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 4.

  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign performs in slot two or slot three.
  
  The possible earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform depends on the slot Yardsign performs in.
  If Yardsign performs in slot two, then the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot four.
  If Yardsign performs in slot three, then the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot two.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots that need to be filled by six bands.
  - The slots are numbered 1 through 6, from earliest to latest.
  - The bands are Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - We need to determine the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.

Solution:
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then we know that Yardsign will perform in either slot 2 or 3 (because Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots).
  - If Yardsign performs in slot 2, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots 1 and 2 (because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert). But this arrangement violates the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  - If Yardsign performs in slot 3, then Vegemite must perform in slot 1 (because Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon). This means that Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots 2 and 3 (because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert). Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 2.
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform, each in a different slot numbered from one to six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3. 
Therefore, Wellspring can perform in either slot 2 or slot 3, but not in slot 1 because Yardsign will perform in one of the first three slots.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Vegemite has to perform before Zircon. 
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. 
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. 
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. 
  5. Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign. 

Reasoning: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, it means that Yardsign cannot perform in slot one. Since Yardsign has to perform in one of the first three slots, it must perform in slot two or three. If Yardsign performs in slot two, then slot one must be either Vegemite or Wellspring. Since Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Xpert cannot perform in slot one, it means that Wellspring must perform in slot two. Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot two. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Vegemite must perform before Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon must perform before Xpert.
  3. Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
  5. Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  
To find the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform, we need to consider the given constraints. 
If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3 and Zircon in slot 2. This means that slots 1, 2, and 3 are filled by Yardsign, Zircon, and Vegemite, respectively. According to the second constraint, Wellspring must perform in either slot 1 or 2. 

Action: Answer("A")  
Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 2, which means that the earliest slot in which it could perform is slot 2.

Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. 

Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be:
  1. Peters
  2. Quinn
  3. Rovero
  4. Unknown
  5. Unknown
  6. Villas
  7. White
  
  We know that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Since Tao has not been placed in the order, we can assume that Stanton could have been recruited either before or after Tao. Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton could have been recruited either before or after Quinn and Rovero.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment must be one of the following:
  Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Stanton
  Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Quinn, Tao, Stanton
  
  In the first sequence, Stanton was recruited last, and in the second sequence, Stanton was recruited sixth.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  2. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  3. Peters was recruited fourth.
  4. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  5. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao. This is because there are only seven accomplices, so each accomplice is recruited one at a time. If Quinn was recruited before Rovero, then the order of the seven accomplices is: [Quinn], [Rovero], ?, ?, ?, ?, ?. Since Stanton cannot be immediately before or after Tao, then the only possible position for Stanton is third. Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited third.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.

Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth, then Quinn, Peters, and the suspect were the first three people, in some order. That means the earliest Stanton could have been recruited is fourth. If Stanton was not recruited fourth, then he must have been recruited later. Since there are only four positions later than fourth (fifth, sixth, seventh, and last), the answer must be one of those positions.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited before Rovero.

If Quinn was recruited before Rovero, then the possible order of recruitment of the accomplices is:
  1. Quinn
  2. (unknown)
  3. (unknown)
  4. Peters
  5. (unknown)
  6. Villas
  7. White
If Stanton was recruited first, second, or third, then he cannot be recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. So, the possible order of recruitment would be:
  1. Stanton
  2. Quinn
  3. (unknown)
  4. Peters
  5. (unknown)
  6. Villas
  7. White
In this case, Tao could have been recruited in position 3, which contradicts the fact that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third, and the only possible position for him would be fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the accomplices is Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is Peters, Quinn, Rovero, ...
  This means that Stanton must be recruited after Quinn and Rovero.
  
  A: It is possible for Stanton to be recruited first.
  B: It is possible for Stanton to be recruited second.
  C: It is possible for Stanton to be recruited third.
  D: It is NOT possible for Stanton to be recruited fifth, since this would mean that Tao was immediately before Stanton, which is not allowed.
  E: It is possible for Stanton to be recruited seventh. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, (unknown accomplice), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown accomplice), (unknown accomplice), (unknown accomplice), Villas, White.
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth, so we can update the order of recruitment to be (unknown accomplice), (unknown accomplice), (unknown accomplice), Peters, Quinn, Rovero, (unknown accomplice), Villas, White.
  We also know that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao. This means that Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth, since those would be the positions immediately before or after Peters and Rovero, respectively.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  2. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  3. Peters was recruited fourth.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: 
  Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  
  Stanton was recruited after Tao and before Quinn. Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited first, second, or third. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The order of accomplices recruited is: Peters (4th), Quinn (before Rovero), Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas (before White), and White.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the two accomplices is: Quinn, Rovero.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the two accomplices is: Quinn, Rovero. Therefore, Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth, which means that Peters was recruited before Rovero and Stanton.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, which means that White was recruited last.
  Since Peters was recruited fourth, Quinn was recruited before Rovero, and Villas was recruited before White, then the order of accomplices recruited is: Peters, (Quinn, Rovero), Stanton, Tao, Villas, White.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited second. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?
  Peters was recruited fourth, which means he is not recruited before Quinn and Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, which means Villas and White must be recruited at positions 6 and 7, in some order.
  This leaves three people to be recruited in positions 3, 5, and one of the first two positions.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?
  Peters was recruited fourth, which means he is not recruited before Quinn and Rovero. This leaves three people to be recruited in positions 3, 5, and one of the first two positions.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, which means Villas and White must be recruited at positions 6 and 7, in some order.
  Since Peters was recruited fourth, Stanton cannot be recruited fifth, otherwise he would be recruited immediately before Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited first or second, then the only possible order for the remaining recruits would be: Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Tao, Villas, White. However, this order violates the rule that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited first or second.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the only possible order for the remaining recruits would be: Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Peters, Tao, Villas, White. This order satisfies all the rules. Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton must have been recruited third.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member of the six-member band performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Action: 
From the given restrictions, we know that the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, and the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does. If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the first, second, third, or fifth solo, and the saxophonist must perform the fourth or sixth solo. 
Option A is not necessarily true because the percussionist could perform the second, third, or fifth solo. 
Option B is not necessarily true because the percussionist could perform the first, third, or fifth solo. 
Option C is not necessarily true because the violinist could perform the first, second, third, or fifth solo. 
Option D is not necessarily true because the percussionist could perform the first or second solo. 
Option E is not necessarily true because the saxophonist could perform the sixth solo. 

Therefore, none of the options are necessarily true. 
Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  Each member performs exactly one solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist, it means that the saxophonist's solo cannot be the first or the second. Also, since the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, the keyboard player's solo cannot be the first. Furthermore, since the keyboard player performs after the violinist, the violinist's solo cannot be the last.
  
  A: The percussionist cannot perform the first solo, as the saxophonist's solo cannot be the second or the first.
  B: This could be a possibility, but it is not a must be true statement.
  C: This could be a possibility, but it is not a must be true statement.
  D: This statement has no bearing on the order of solos performed by the band members.
  E: This could be a possibility, but it is not a must be true statement.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: 
  First, we know that the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist.
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist, then it is possible that the percussionist performs the first solo or the second solo.
  
  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist cannot perform a solo after the percussionist does, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the percussionist does not perform the first solo.
  
  If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist can perform a solo after the percussionist does, which satisfies the given conditions.
  
  Therefore, we can conclude that the percussionist performs the second solo.
  
  Now, we need to find what must be true given that the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist. 
  The answer is not A or B since we know that the percussionist does not perform the first solo. 
  
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does. 
  This could be true, but not necessarily. There are no restrictions that require the violinist to perform before the saxophonist, but it is a possibility.
  
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  This could be true, but not necessarily. There are no restrictions that require the percussionist to perform before the trumpeter, but it is a possibility.
  
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  This cannot be true since we know that the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. We also know that the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform a solo before the keyboard player does.
  
  Answer: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  Each member performs exactly one solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Solution:
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then we know that the saxophonist's solo comes after the percussionist's solo. Therefore, the saxophonist's solo cannot be the first or the second solo. Hence, the percussionist's solo cannot be the third solo either, since that would mean the saxophonist's solo comes immediately after the percussionist's solo. So, the percussionist's solo must be the first or the second solo. 

  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist's solo must come after both the percussionist's and the trumpeter's solos. However, we cannot determine the order in which the keyboard player and the guitarist perform their solos, since the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.

  If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist's solo must come after either the percussionist's or the trumpeter's solos, but not both. So, if the percussionist performs the second solo, then the trumpeter must perform the first solo, since the saxophonist cannot perform the first solo. Also, the violinist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, and the keyboard player performs a solo before the guitarist does. Therefore, this option is true.

  If the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, we cannot determine the order in which the percussionist, the keyboard player, and the guitarist perform their solos. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.

  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does, we cannot determine the order in which the saxophonist, the keyboard player, and the guitarist perform their solos. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.

  If the saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does, we cannot determine the order in which the percussionist, the trumpet player, the violinist, and the guitarist perform their solos. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: 
If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then:
  - It is possible that the percussionist performs the first solo, but it is not required.
  - It is possible that the percussionist performs the second solo, but it is not required.
  - The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, so C cannot be true.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, so D cannot be true.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, so E cannot be true.
Therefore, the answer is either A or B, but we cannot determine which one is true.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo. 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis: 
  We know that the percussionist performs before the saxophonist. Possible positions for the percussionist's solo are the first, the second, or the third solos. 
  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist could perform the fourth solo, which would violate the rule that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, we can eliminate choice A. 
  If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist could perform the fifth solo, which would also violate the rule that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, we can eliminate choice B.
  If the percussionist performs the third solo, then the saxophonist must perform either the fifth or the sixth solo. 
  
Knowledge: 
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  
Analysis: 
  Since the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter but not both, the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist and before the trumpeter. Therefore, the trumpeter must perform either the fifth or the sixth solo.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform either the second or the third solo.
  Since the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, the violinist must perform the fourth solo.
  
Conclusion: 
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the percussionist must perform the third solo. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform either the fifth or the sixth solo. The violinist must perform the fourth solo. The trumpeter must perform either the fifth or the sixth solo. The keyboard player must perform either the second or the third solo. 
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Solution:
  We know that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform either 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th solo. 

  We also know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, which means the guitarist must perform either 1st, 2nd, 5th, or 6th solo. 

  Since the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and before the guitarist does, we can conclude that the keyboard player performs either 2nd, 3rd, or 4th solo.

  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist could still perform 3rd, 5th, or 6th solo, which is still uncertain. Therefore, we can eliminate choice A. 

  If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist could perform 3rd or 6th solo. If the saxophonist performs the 3rd solo, then the keyboard player must perform the 4th solo, and the violinist must perform the 5th solo, which is not possible since the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform the 6th solo. In this case, the violinist must perform the 5th solo, the keyboard player must perform the 4th solo, the percussionist must perform the 2nd solo, and the guitarist must perform the 1st solo. Thus, we can conclude that choice B is the correct answer.

  Choice C is not necessarily true because we don't know when the violinist performs the solo.
  Choice D is incorrect because we don't know when the trumpeter performs the solo.
  Choice E is not necessarily true because we don't know when the keyboard player performs the solo.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band: guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist.
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - Restrictions:
    - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
    - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
    - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("B")  
If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the percussionist should perform either the first or second solo, because the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, Option A is not necessarily true. Option B must be true because if the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist can perform a solo after the trumpeter does, which contradicts the given restrictions. Option C is not necessarily true because the violinist could perform a solo after the saxophonist does and before the keyboard player does. Option D is false because we do not know when the trumpeter performs a solo. Option E is not necessarily true because we do not know when the keyboard player performs a solo.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  In this problem, each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist does but before the trumpeter does. That means the percussionist must perform a solo before the trumpeter does, so the answer is D. None of the other choices must be true.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in a band, and each member performs exactly one solo. 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
Analysis: 
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist. This means that the saxophonist cannot perform the first solo. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform the fifth or sixth solo. The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist, so the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the first solo, and the violinist must perform before the saxophonist.

Topic: Law
Context: A naturalist will give five lectures, each on a different type of bird: oystercatchers, petrels, rails, sandpipers, or terns. The lectures must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium, in an order that meets the following conditions: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The naturalist will give 5 lectures on different types of birds.
- The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
- The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
- Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
- The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and comes before the lecture on oystercatchers.
- The lecture on terns is given before the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Analyzing the answer choices:
A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This could be true, as the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. Not necessarily false.
B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. This could be true, as the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Not necessarily false.
C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This could be false, as exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The fifth lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall, so this statement is false.
D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. This could be true, as the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Not necessarily false.
E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This could be false, as exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The third lecture is not in Gladwyn Hall, so this statement is false.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  2. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  3. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  4. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Analysis:
  - The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, so (A) can be true.
  - The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so (D) must be false.
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, so the maximum number of lectures that can be in Howard Auditorium is 2. Therefore, (B) and (E) can be true, but (C) must be false.
  - The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers, so the lecture on oystercatchers is given in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, (C) is false, and (E) is true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
Analysis:
  We know that the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and that exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the second lecture must be in Howard Auditorium. The fourth lecture must also be in Howard Auditorium, and the lecture on sandpipers is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers which means that the lecture on oystercatchers must be in Gladwyn Hall. We also know that the lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. 
  
  Let's now consider each of the answer choices:
  A: Both the first and second lectures cannot be in Gladwyn Hall because the second lecture must be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, this statement is false.
  B: This statement is true because we have established that the first, second, and fourth lectures are in Gladwyn Hall and Howard Auditorium.
  C: The second lecture is in Howard Auditorium, and the fifth lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall because the fourth lecture is already in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, this statement is false. 
  D: This statement is false because the third lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall, and the fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium. 
  E: This statement is false because the third lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall, and the fifth lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall because there are only three lectures in Gladwyn Hall.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, which means at least one lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, which means at least one lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  - Three lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, which means exactly two lectures are in Howard Auditorium.
  - The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  - The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
A: If the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, the second lecture cannot also be in Gladwyn Hall, because there must be at least one lecture in Howard Auditorium before the fourth lecture.
B: This is possible, because the second and third lectures can both be in Howard Auditorium, which means the first, fourth, and fifth lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
C: This is possible, because the second and fifth lectures can both be in Gladwyn Hall, which means the first, fourth, and third lectures are in Howard Auditorium.
D: This is not possible, because the fourth lecture is already in Howard Auditorium, which means the third lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall.
E: This is not possible, because the third lecture must be in Howard Auditorium, which means the fifth lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Analysis:
  If the second lecture is in Howard Auditorium, then the third lecture cannot be in Howard Auditorium, which makes choice B false.
  If the second lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, then the third lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall, which makes choice C false.
  If the third lecture is in Howard Auditorium, then the fourth lecture cannot be in Howard Auditorium, which makes choice D false.
  If the fifth lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, then the lecture on petrels would have to be in Howard Auditorium, which contradicts the given conditions, making choice E false.
  This leaves choice A as the only option that could be false.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are five lectures, each on a different bird type: oystercatchers, petrels, rails, sandpipers, or terns.
  Lectures must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium.
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Analysis:
  To satisfy the lecture conditions, we know that the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Additionally, we know that the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. Furthermore, we know that the lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. Since exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, we can deduce that the second and fifth lectures must be in Howard Auditorium. 

Solution:
  If the second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium, then the third lecture must be on petrels. Since the lecture on petrels is in Gladwyn Hall, this creates a contradiction. Therefore, the answer is (B) The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

A: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. True.
   The second lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall because exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
   Therefore, the first and second lectures are not both in Gladwyn Hall. 
B: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. True.
   The third lecture cannot be in Howard Auditorium because the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
   Therefore, the second and third lectures are not both in Howard Auditorium.
C: The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. True.
   The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. True.
   The lecture on oystercatchers cannot be the first lecture because the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
   Therefore, the second and fifth lectures are not both in Gladwyn Hall.
D: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. True.
   The third lecture cannot be in Howard Auditorium because the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
   Therefore, the third and fourth lectures are not both in Howard Auditorium.
E: The third lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall because exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
   Therefore, the third and fifth lectures are not both in Gladwyn Hall.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  - The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
A: If the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, the second lecture cannot also be in Gladwyn Hall, as exactly three of the lectures must be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, A is true.
B: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so it is not possible for both the second and third lectures to also be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, B is true.
C: The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on oystercatchers is the earliest lecture that can be in Gladwyn Hall, as the first lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lecture on petrels cannot be the second Gladwyn Hall lecture. Therefore, C is false.
D: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so it is not possible for both the third and fourth lectures to also be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, D is true.
E: The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. As the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, the lecture on terns cannot be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lecture on rails, sandpipers, and oystercatchers must all be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lecture on petrels cannot be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, E is false.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
  A: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, so the second lecture cannot also be in Gladwyn Hall, since each lecture must be on a different bird. Therefore, this statement must be false.
  B: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so the third lecture cannot also be in Howard Auditorium, since each lecture must be on a different bird. Therefore, this statement must be false.
  C: The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lecture on terns cannot be in Gladwyn Hall. Also, the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium, which means the lecture on oystercatchers cannot be in Howard Auditorium. Thus, the second and fifth lectures must both be in Gladwyn Hall. This statement does not have to be false.
  D: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so the third lecture cannot also be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, this statement must be false.
  E: The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lecture on terns cannot be in Gladwyn Hall. Also, the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium, which means the lecture on oystercatchers cannot be in Howard Auditorium. Thus, the third and fifth lectures cannot both be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, this statement must be false.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Four art students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will display exactly two paintings (an oil and a watercolor) at an exhibition.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room (walls 1, 2, 3, and 4) with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know that:
  - Wall 2 has an oil painting by Hidalgo and another painting (a watercolor or an oil).
  - Neither of the paintings on wall 2 can be a watercolor by Hidalgo.
  - Neither of the paintings on wall 2 can be an oil painting by Franz or Isaacs.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so neither of the paintings on wall 2 can be Greene's watercolor.
  
Analysis:
  - Greene's oil cannot be on wall 2, as it would mean that wall 1 has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - If wall 2 has Hidalgo's oil and Isaacs's watercolor, then wall 3 has Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor.
  - Therefore, it is possible for Isaacs's watercolor to be displayed on wall 2, given that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each student has exactly one oil and one watercolor painting.
  2. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Analysis:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 because no wall can have only watercolors. At the same time, because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, neither of them can have their oil or watercolor painting on wall 2. By process of elimination, the only possible painting to be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, and no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed with someone else's oil. Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, and since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, then Franz's oil must be displayed on a different wall. Therefore, the only option for one of the paintings that could be displayed on wall 2 with Hidalgo's oil is Greene's oil.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.

Action: Answer("C") 

If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we know that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2, as that would violate the rule that no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Additionally, we know that neither of Franz's paintings nor Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on wall 2, as they cannot be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil according to the rule that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. This leaves us with only Greene's paintings as a possibility for what could also be displayed on wall 2. According to the rule that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, it must be the case that Greene's oil is displayed in the lower position of that same wall (wall 2). Therefore, the answer is C: Greene's oil.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs; two paintings each.
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil, and one watercolor, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation: 
If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we cannot have either Hidalgo's watercolor or Greene's oil on wall 2. Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2 because it cannot appear on the same wall as Isaacs's painting. Therefore, the only option left is Isaacs's watercolor, which can be displayed on wall 2.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Four students, Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs, will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  2. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then:
  - Wall 2 has an oil painting by Hidalgo and a watercolor painting by one of the other three students.
  - Wall 2 cannot have both paintings by the same student.
  - Wall 2 cannot have both paintings by Franz and Isaacs.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, which means that if Franz's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must also be displayed on wall 2.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, which means that Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  
  Therefore, the possible paintings that could be displayed on wall 2 are:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Each of the four walls contains two paintings, one on the upper position and one on the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Based on the given information, we know that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2. This means that the lower position of wall 2 must have a painting that meets the given conditions. 

Analysis:
  1. Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  2. Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 since it is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  3. Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  5. Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on wall 2 since it meets all the given conditions.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  Franz and Isaacs cannot have any paintings displayed on the same wall.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall with Franz's oil.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  
Analysis:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, this means that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it. This also means that neither of Hidalgo's paintings can be displayed on any other wall. 
  Since no wall can have only one student's work displayed on it, this means that Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 since Hidalgo's oil is already displayed on that wall. Therefore, the only painting that could be displayed on wall 2 along with Hidalgo's oil is Greene's watercolor, as it is displayed in the upper position of the wall with Franz's oil.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Hidalgo's oil is on wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Using the given information, we can infer that Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 because that would mean only Greene's works are displayed on wall 2, violating one of the conditions. Similarly, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 because that would mean only Hidalgo's works are displayed on wall 2. Isaacs's watercolor also cannot be on wall 2 because that would mean Isaacs's oil is also on wall 2, which is not allowed. 

Therefore, the only possible option is Franz's oil, which can be displayed on wall 2 along with Hidalgo's oil. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Each of the 4 walls must have exactly two paintings (one oil and one watercolor) displayed on it.
  - No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2, and Franz's oil and Isaacs's oil cannot be on wall 2 either due to the conditions mentioned above. 
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: Since Hidalgo's oil is already on wall 2, and no wall can have only watercolors, we cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor on wall 2. We also cannot have the oil paintings of either Franz or Isaacs on wall 2. That leaves only Greene's watercolor, which must be in the upper position on the same wall as Franz's oil (wall 1), according to the given condition. Therefore, the answer is B (Greene's watercolor).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel.
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  - There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either in bay 3 or bay 5.
  
Analysis:
  - If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either in bay 3 or bay 5. Therefore, bay 1, 2, 4, and 6 cannot hold livestock.
  - Choice A: Bay 2 cannot hold fuel because fuel is held in a bay lower than the bay holding produce.
  - Choice B: Bay 4 can hold produce because produce is held in a bay higher than the bay holding fuel and textiles is next to produce.
  - Choice C: Bay 4 can hold textiles because textiles is held in any bay other than the bay holding livestock.
  - Choice D: Bay 5 can hold grain because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock and the bay holding livestock is either in bay 3 or bay 5.
  - Choice E: Bay 5 cannot hold machinery because machinery is held in any bay other than the bay holding livestock.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
- Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
- The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
- The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
- The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
- The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Action: 
- If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then we can deduce that the bay holding livestock is either bay 3 or bay 4. If bay 3 is holding livestock, then bay 4 must be holding textiles. If bay 4 is holding livestock, then bay 3 must be holding grain. So we can eliminate choices C and D.
- If bay 4 is holding produce, then bay 3 must be holding textiles. Since the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, bay 2 must be holding fuel and bay 5 must be holding livestock. So we can eliminate choices A and E.
- This leaves us with only one remaining choice, which is B: Bay 4 is holding produce. This cannot be true if we have already determined that bay 4 is holding livestock. Therefore, the answer is B. 

Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The six bays are numbered consecutively from 1 to 6.
  - Each bay is holding a different type of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. 
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Solution:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bays holding livestock and produce must be in positions 4 and 5 (in some order). Therefore, the bays in position 3 and 6 must hold textiles and grain (in some order). So, we have:
  - Bay 1: ?
  - Bay 2: ?
  - Bay 3: textiles/grain
  - Bay 4: produce/livestock
  - Bay 5: livestock/produce
  - Bay 6: grain/textiles

  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. It is possible that Bay 2 holds fuel. Therefore, A could be true.
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce. It is not possible since Bay 4 is holding produce/livestock. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles. It is not possible since Bay 4 is holding produce/livestock. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain. It is not possible since Bay 5 is holding livestock/produce. Therefore, D is not true.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery. It is possible that Bay 5 holds machinery. Therefore, E could be true.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively.
  - There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
For the statement "If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock", we know that:
  - Bay 5 must be holding either livestock or produce.
  - Bay 4 must be holding the type of cargo that is not next to produce. This means it must be holding either textiles, fuel, or machinery.
  - Following from the first two points, we know that Bay 4 cannot be holding produce, so B is false.
  
Analysis of each choice:
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. Nothing in the problem limits Bay 2 from holding fuel, so this could be true.
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce. Bay 4 cannot be holding produce, because of the information above. Therefore, this is false.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles. Bay 4 could be holding textiles, and it is the only cargo type that Bay 4 can hold, so this could be true.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain. Bay 5 could be holding grain, since nothing in the problem limits Bay 5 from holding grain, so this could be true.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery. Bay 5 could be holding machinery, since nothing in the problem limits Bay 5 from holding machinery, so this could be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - The bays are numbered consecutively from one side of the dock to the other, from 1 to 6.

Analysis:
  - If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either 3 or 5.
  - If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either 3 or 5.
  - Therefore, bays 3 and 5 are holding either produce and textiles, and livestock and grain, but we do not know which is which.
  - Option A is possible because fuel can be in any of the remaining four bays.
  - Option B is possible. The bay holding produce can be either 5 or 6.
  - Option C is possible. The bay holding textiles can be either 3 or 5.
  - Option D is not possible. If bay 5 is holding grain, then the bay holding livestock must be 3, which means that bay 4 is holding textiles, and bay 6 is holding produce. But this violates the rule that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - Option E is possible. Machinery can be in any of the remaining four bays.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six bays numbered consecutively from 1 to 6.
  - There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - Grain > Livestock, Livestock > Textiles, Produce > Fuel, Textiles is next to Produce.
  - Produce is next to Livestock.
  
  A: There is no information in the given statements that implies whether Bay 2 is holding fuel or not. It could be holding fuel.
  B: If Bay 4 is holding produce, and produce is next to Livestock, then Livestock must be in Bay 3 and Bay 5 must be holding Textiles. This is consistent with the given statements.
  C: If Bay 4 is holding Textiles, and Textiles is next to Produce, then Produce must be in Bay 3 and Livestock must be in Bay 5. This contradicts the statement that Livestock has a higher number than Textiles.
  D: If Bay 5 is holding Grain, and Grain > Livestock, then Livestock must be in Bay 4 and Textiles must be in Bay 6. This is consistent with the given statements.
  E: If Bay 5 is holding Machinery, then Textiles must be in Bay 4 and Livestock must be in Bay 6. This is consistent with the given statements.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - The first three statements describe the order of bays from higher to lower number and the type of cargo in each bay.
  - The fourth statement states that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the possible orderings are: L-P-T or T-P-L (L=livestock, P=produce, T=textiles).
  - A: There is no restriction on bay 2, so it could be holding fuel.
  - B: If bay 4 holds produce, then bay 5 must hold fuel, which is not allowed because produce must be next to textiles.
  - C: If bay 4 holds textiles, then bay 3 must hold produce, which is not allowed because produce must be next to livestock.
  - D: If bay 5 holds grain, then bay 4 must hold livestock, which is not allowed because livestock must be next to textiles.
  - E: If bay 5 holds machinery, then bay 4 must hold produce, which is allowed.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
- Bay 2 holds one of the six types of cargo.
- Bay 3 holds one of the six types of cargo.
- Bay 4 holds one of the six types of cargo.
- Bay 5 holds one of the six types of cargo.
- Bay 6 holds one of the six types of cargo.
- Grain is held in a bay with a number higher than the bay holding livestock.
- Livestock is held in a bay with a number higher than the bay holding textiles.
- Produce is held in a bay with a number higher than the bay holding fuel.
- Textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Analysis:
- If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
- If the bay holding livestock is bay 3, then the bay holding textiles is bay 4 and the bay holding produce is bay 5. This means that bay 6 must hold either fuel, grain, or machinery. Therefore, A and D could be true.
- If the bay holding livestock is bay 5, then the bay holding textiles is bay 4 and the bay holding produce is bay 6. This means that bay 3 must hold either fuel, grain, or machinery. Therefore, B, C, and E could be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
- The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
- The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
- The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, that means bay 3 is holding either produce or livestock. Since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, bay 4 cannot be holding textiles. This eliminates choice C. All of the other choices are still possible, so they are not exceptions.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
- The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
- The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
- The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Action: 
If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then we can infer that the bay holding produce is either bay 5 or bay 6. Also, the bay holding livestock must be bay 4. Therefore:
- A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. This could be true since bay 2 is not next to bay 5 or bay 6, so it could hold fuel even if bay 5 or bay 6 is holding produce.
- B: Bay 4 is holding produce. This is not possible since we know that bay 4 is holding livestock, and the bay holding produce is either bay 5 or bay 6.
- C: Bay 4 is holding textiles. This could be true since bay 4 is holding livestock, and the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, which is either bay 5 or bay 6.
- D: Bay 5 is holding grain. This could be true since the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, which is bay 4.
- E: Bay 5 is holding machinery. This could be true since bay 5 is not next to bay 4 or bay 6, so it could hold machinery even if bay 4 is holding livestock and bay 6 is holding produce.

Therefore, the answer is B: Bay 4 is holding produce.

  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, it means that neither the western nor the sci-fi film is shown on screen 3.
  
  A: The horror film can't be shown on screen 2 as it is shown on a different screen than the mystery.
  B: The mystery can't be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2 as the romance is not shown on screen 2.
  C: The romance can't be shown on screen 3 as the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.

  E: The western can begin at 7 P.M. and the sci-fi film can begin at 9 P.M. on screen 1, which means that the horror film and mystery are shown on screens 2 and 3, but we don't know the order in which they are shown.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then they must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2. If they are shown on screen 1, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 2. If they are shown on screen 2, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 1. Additionally, the romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 3. The mystery cannot be shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2. 

Analysis:
  - A: The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen.
  - B: The mystery can begin at 7 P.M. on screen 1 or screen 2, or it can begin at 9 P.M. on screen 1.
  - C: The romance must be shown on screen 3, so this cannot be true if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen.
  - D: The sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M. if it is shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  - E: The western can begin at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M. on screen 1 or screen 2, or it can begin at 8 P.M. on screen 3.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.

  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then they must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.

  If the western is shown on screen 1 or 2, then the horror film must be shown on the other screen, because it begins after the western.
  
  The mystery can only be shown on screen 1 or 2, because it cannot be shown on the same screen as the horror film. Therefore, the romance cannot be shown on the same screen as the mystery.
  
  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1 or 2, then it must be shown with the western, because the romance cannot be shown on the same screen as the mystery, and the horror film must be shown on the other screen.

  Therefore, the only possible schedule that satisfies all the conditions is: 
   - Screen 1 (7 P.M.): Western and Sci-fi
   - Screen 2 (9 P.M.): Horror and Mystery
   - Screen 3 (8 P.M.): Romance

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each.
  - Screen 3 shows one movie only.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show movies at 7 PM and 9 PM.
  - Screen 3 shows a movie at 8 PM.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are on different screens.

Analysis:
  - If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then:
    - The romance cannot be shown on screen 2.
    - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
    - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
    - The western begins before the horror film.
    - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, so the western and the sci-fi film must be on the same screen.
    - Screen 1 and 2 show movies at 7 PM and 9 PM, so the western and the sci-fi film must be shown at either 7 PM or 9 PM.

Action: Answer("D") - The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Western begins before horror film
- Sci-fi is not on screen 3
- Romance is not on screen 2
- Horror and mystery are on different screens
- Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each
- Screen 3 shows exactly one movie

If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then:
- The horror film can't be shown on screen 2 (because mystery and horror must be on different screens)
- The mystery can't be shown on screen 2 (because romance is not on screen 2)
- The romance can't be shown on screen 3 (because screen 3 shows only one movie)
- The sci-fi film can't begin at 7 P.M. (because screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, and western and sci-fi must be shown on the same screen)
- The western can't begin at 8 P.M. (because sci-fi is not shown on screen 3)

Therefore, the only option that could be true is:
Action: Answer("A") The horror film is shown on screen 2.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screens 1 and 2. The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 3. If the romance is shown on screen 3, then the sci-fi film cannot be shown on the same screen as the western, and if the romance is shown on screen 1, then neither the horror film nor the mystery can be shown on screen 1. Therefore, the only possibility is that the romance is shown on screen 3.
  
  A: The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 if the mystery is shown on the other screen, so this cannot be true.
  B: The mystery can be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2 if the horror film is shown on screen 1, so this could be true.
  C: The romance must be shown on screen 3, so this is true.
  D: The sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M. if it is shown on the same screen as the western, so this cannot be true.
  E: The western must begin before the horror film, so this cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  There are three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, that means that they are shown on either screen 1 or screen 2. 
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2, the horror film cannot be shown on screen 2.
  The only option that could be true is that the horror film is shown on screen 1, so the mystery film must be shown on screen 2. 
  Also, the western begins before the horror film, so it cannot be shown at 8 P.M. on screen 3, which eliminates option C. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. The western begins before the horror film.
  2. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  3. The romance is not shown on screen 2.

  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, it means they will be shown on screen 1 or 2 since screen 3 only shows one movie. In either case, the romance movie cannot be shown on that screen, so it will be shown on the other screen. The horror and mystery movies must be shown on the remaining two screens. The western movie must begin before the horror movie, so it must be shown at 7 P.M. The sci-fi movie can be shown at 9 P.M. or at 8 P.M, but it cannot be shown on screen 3. Therefore, the only choice that could be true is (A) The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then there are only two possible scenarios: (1) western and sci-fi on screen 1, and (2) western and sci-fi on screen 2.
  
A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
   If the horror film is shown on screen 2, then the mystery must be shown on screen 1, and the romance must be shown on screen 3. But the romance is not shown on screen 2, so this scenario is not possible.
B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
   If the mystery begins at 9 P.M., then the horror film must begin at 7 P.M. and be shown on screen 2. But the romance is not shown on screen 2, so this scenario is not possible.
C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
   If the romance is shown on screen 3, then the mystery must be shown on screen 1, and the horror film must be shown on screen 2. But the horror film must begin after the western, which means it must start at 9 P.M. on screen 2. This would leave screen 1 with only the western and sci-fi film, which is not possible.
D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
   If the sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M., then the western must begin at 9 P.M. on screen 2, and the horror film must be shown on screen 1. The mystery must be shown on screen 3, and the romance must be shown on screen 2. This scenario is possible.
E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
   If the western begins at 8 P.M., then the horror film must begin after that on screen 1. This means the mystery must be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M., which leaves screen 2 with only the romance and sci-fi films at 9 P.M. But the romance is not shown on screen 2, so this scenario is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies showing at the repertory theater.
  - The movies are shown on three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Action: Answer("A")

If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only way to satisfy the condition that the western begins before the horror film is to schedule the western on either screen 1 or screen 2 at 7 P.M. and the sci-fi film on the other screen at 9 P.M. Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, and the romance is not shown on screen 2, the only possibility is to show the horror film on screen 2 at 9 P.M., which means the mystery must be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. Therefore, the horror film is shown on screen 2. Answer: A

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: Which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one?
Choices:
  A: Yardsign
  B: Vegemite, Wellspring
  C: Vegemite, Yardsign
  D: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign
  E: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, Zircon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - We need to find a complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one.
  
Analysis:
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. So, it could perform in slot one.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. So, Vegemite could perform in slot one.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. So, Wellspring could perform in slot one.
  - Therefore, a complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one is Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
- Wellspring and Zircon must each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
- Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.

Approach:
- We need to find the bands that can perform in slot one.
- Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
- So, Yardsign can perform in slot one.
- Now, we need to find the other bands that can perform in slot one along with Yardsign.
- Uneasy cannot perform in slot one as it must perform in one of the last three slots.
- So, Uneasy cannot perform in slot one.
- Wellspring and Zircon must each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert and hence they cannot perform in slot one.
- Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon and hence it can perform in slot one.
- Therefore, the only possible list of bands that can perform in slot one is Yardsign and Vegemite.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The band that performs in slot one must be one of the bands that performs in the first three slots, meaning it can be Yardsign, Vegemite, or Wellspring.
  The band that performs in slot one must also satisfy the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, which means that Zircon cannot perform in slot one, eliminating option E.
  The band that performs in slot one cannot be Yardsign alone since there are five other bands and each band can perform in just one slot, eliminating option A.
  The band that performs in slot one can be Vegemite alone or Wellspring alone or Vegemite and Wellspring together, satisfying the constraints mentioned in the context. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The bands are: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  We need to find a complete and accurate list of bands that can perform in slot one.

Analysis: 
  Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots and Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, they cannot perform in slot one. 
  Also, as per the given constraints Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon and Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. 
  So, the only bands that can perform in slot one are the ones that do not violate these constraints. 
  Thus, we can have Vegemite, Wellspring, or both of them, perform in slot one. 
  Yardsign cannot perform in slot one as it is not allowed to perform in any of the last three slots. 
  So, options A, C, D, and E can be eliminated.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The first slot must be filled by one of the bands that performs in the first three slots.
  The bands that perform in the first three slots are Yardsign, Vegemite, and Wellspring.
  The order of performance must satisfy the following constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
    
Analysis:
  Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, it is possible for Yardsign to perform in slot one. Therefore, choices A, B, and C are not complete. 
  Choice D is a complete list because it includes all the bands that perform in the first three slots. 
  Choice E is not a complete list because Zircon cannot perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, which means that only one of them can perform before the other.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The slots at a benefit concert are numbered slot one through slot six.
  The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

To determine which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one, we can use the following logic:
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it could perform in slot one.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so it could perform in slot one.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so either of these three bands could perform in slot one.

Based on the above, the answer is: 
Action: Answer("D") - Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Slot 1 is one of the first three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.

Eliminating choices:
  A: Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, but we don't know if it will be the first slot.
  B: This list includes Wellspring, but it is not guaranteed that Wellspring will perform in one of the first three slots.
  C: This list includes Vegemite and Yardsign, but it is not guaranteed that Vegemite will perform in the first slot.
  D: This list includes Vegemite and Wellspring, which are guaranteed to perform in earlier slots than Xpert, as well as Yardsign, which is guaranteed to perform in one of the first three slots. This is a possible list of bands for Slot 1.
  E: This list includes all the bands, but it is not guaranteed that all of them will perform in one of the first three slots.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
- Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.

Analysis:
- According to the first rule, Yardsign can perform in either slot one, two or three.
- According to the second rule, Vegemite must perform in a slot before Zircon, so it could either be slot one or two, but not slot three.
- According to the third rule, Wellspring and Zircon must perform before Xpert, but we don't know the order of these three bands yet.
- According to the fourth rule, Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, so it could be in slot four, five or six.

Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
Based on the analysis, Vegemite, Wellspring and Yardsign all could perform in slot one. Therefore, the complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one is Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We are looking for a list of bands that could perform in slot one, given the constraints.
  Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
Analysis:
  Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, it could perform in slot one.
  Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Vegemite could perform in slot one, but Zircon cannot.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Wellspring could perform in slot one, but Zircon cannot.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the six bands must meet a set of constraints.
  Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
A: The band that performs in slot one must be Yardsign. However, the list does not include any other bands that could perform in slot one.
B: This list includes Vegemite and Wellspring which must perform before Xpert, but it does not include Yardsign which must perform in one of the first three slots.
C: This list includes Vegemite and Yardsign which could perform in slot one, but it does not include any other bands that could perform in slot one.
D: This list includes Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign which could perform in slot one based on the given constraints.
E: This list includes all six bands, but it is not accurate because Uneasy cannot perform in any of the first three slots.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Hence, there are three books on the bottom shelf and at least two books on the middle shelf. 
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.

To consider the situation where L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, we can place L on the middle shelf and H on the top shelf. This leaves the bottom shelf with three books, which must be K, O, and one other book. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, F cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf with L and I. G and the remaining book must be on the top shelf with H.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F and M are on the same shelf.

Action: 
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so if L is placed on a higher shelf than H, then O must be on the bottom shelf and H must be on the top shelf. This means that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, which implies that F and M must be on the middle shelf. Also, since K is on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, G and H must be on the top shelf, and I must be on the middle shelf. Using this information, we can eliminate choices A, C, D, and E. The only option left is B.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - I is placed on the middle shelf
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - There are three shelves, and at least two books are on each shelf
Action: Answer("C")  
If L is placed on a shelf higher than H, then H must be on the bottom shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, G must be on the top shelf. Therefore, M and F are on the bottom shelf. K is above F, so K must be on the middle shelf, and O must be on the top shelf. Therefore, H and M must be on the same shelf, which is the bottom shelf. Thus, the answer is (C).
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.

If L is placed on a shelf higher than H, it means L can only be placed on the top shelf while H can only be placed on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("B")  
If G and H are placed on the same shelf, then G must also be on the bottom shelf and H must be on the top shelf. This satisfies the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. Since H is on the bottom shelf and M is not on the same shelf as H, then M must be on the top shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M, then K must be on the middle shelf and F must be on the top shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, then O must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, none of the other options can be deduced from the given conditions.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
For the answer to be true, the placement of L must be on the bottom shelf. Given that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, this means that H must also be on the bottom shelf. This leaves only one possibility for the placement of G, which is on the middle shelf.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Each shelf has at least two books.
  - The shelves are top, middle, and bottom.
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on:
  - H cannot be placed on the top shelf because that would mean that L is on the middle or bottom shelf, which would contradict the condition that O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - Therefore, H must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - Since I is on the middle shelf, H cannot be on the middle shelf.
  - Therefore, H must be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, F, G, and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, K, O, and I must be on the top shelf.
  - Therefore, the only answer choice that must be true is E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) are placed on a bookcase with 3 shelves.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, it means that L is on the top shelf and H is either on the middle or the bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, then F is not on the top shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, then K is not on the middle shelf. Therefore, K is on the top shelf and H is on the middle shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then G and O must be on the bottom shelf. This leaves only H and M to be placed on the same shelf, which must be the middle shelf. Thus, the answer is (C) H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom
  - There are at least 2 books on each shelf
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf
  - I is placed on the middle shelf
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M
  
If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the top shelf. This means that at least 4 books are on the bottom shelf and at most 2 books are on the top shelf. Because F is on the same shelf as M, neither of them can be on the top shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf. This leaves only G and O to be placed on the bottom shelf. However, O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the middle shelf. This means that G must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - More books on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  - Each shelf has at least two books.
  
To consider the scenario where L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, we can start by placing I in the middle shelf, and then using the conditions to place K, O, F, and M. This leaves G and H to be placed on different shelves. To ensure that L is placed on a shelf higher than H, we can place L and G on the top shelf, and H on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly 3 shelves.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. 

Analysis of each answer choice:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other. (Impossible to determine without more information.)
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. (If H is on the top shelf, then G must be on the top shelf as well. If H is on the middle shelf, then G must be on the bottom shelf.)
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. (If H is on the top shelf, then M must be on the bottom shelf. If H is on the middle shelf, then M must be on the top shelf.)
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other. (If I is on the middle shelf, then G must be on the top or bottom shelf. If I is on the top or bottom shelf, then G must be on the middle shelf.)
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other. (If K is on the top or middle shelf, then O must be on the bottom shelf. If K is on the bottom shelf, then O must be on the top or middle shelf.)

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: The assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  E: Xu is assigned parking space #5.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees and six parking spaces
  No two employees can have the same parking space
  Young's parking space > Togowa's parking space
  Xu's parking space > Souza's parking space
  Robertson's parking space > Young's parking space
  Robertson can have one of four parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, or #4
  
Analysis:
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. Souza must be assigned parking space #1 and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #2. Togowa must be assigned parking space #3. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
- Six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
- No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
- Rules:
  - Young > Togowa
  - Xu > Souza
  - Robertson > Young
  - Robertson = #1, #2, #3, or #4.

To determine the solution for this problem, we can use the rules to create a chart and determine the possible combinations for each employee. 

| Parking Space | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Robertson     | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |   |   |
| Souza         |   |   | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Togowa        |   |   |   |   | ✓ | ✓ |
| Vaughn        | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Xu            |   |   |   | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Young         |   |   |   | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

We can see that assigning parking space #4 to Robertson fully and uniquely determines the assignments of all other parking spaces, as the chart shows only one possible combination of parking assignments given this condition.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
  No two employees can have the same parking space.
  Young > Togowa
  Xu > Souza
  Robertson > Young
  Robertson can have parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  From the rules, we know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means that there are only four possibilities for Robertson. Once we know where Robertson is parked, we can establish the relative positions of the other employees. We can start with Robertson given that it has only four possibilities and then use the given rules to assign the remaining employees to the parking spaces.

A: Souza is assigned parking space #1. 
  If Souza has parking space #1, then Robertson must have parking space #2, #3, or #4. But we cannot determine where Young and Togowa would park, and we cannot determine where Xu and Vaughn would park relative to each other. Therefore, this option does not fully and uniquely determine the parking spaces.

B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  If Young has parking space #2, then Robertson must have parking space #1. Since Robertson is assigned parking space #1, Souza must have parking space #6, and Xu must have parking space #5. This leaves Togowa and Vaughn to be assigned parking spaces #3 and #4, but we don't know which one of them would be assigned to each parking space. Therefore, this option does not fully and uniquely determine the parking spaces.

C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.
  If Vaughn has parking space #3, then Robertson must have parking space #1, Souza must have parking space #6, and Xu must have parking space #5. This leaves Togowa and Young to be assigned parking spaces #2 and #4, but we don't know which one of them would be assigned to each parking space. Therefore, this option does not fully and uniquely determine the parking spaces.

D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  If Robertson has parking space #4, then Young must have parking space #5, and Togowa must have parking space #6. This leaves Souza and Xu to be assigned parking spaces #1 and #2, but we don't know which one of them would be assigned to each parking space. Therefore, this option does not fully and uniquely determine the parking spaces.

E: Xu is assigned parking space #5.
  If Xu has parking space #5, then Robertson must have parking space #1, Souza must have parking space #2, Young must have parking space #3, and Togowa must have parking space #4. Therefore, this option fully and uniquely determines the parking spaces.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young > Togowa
  - Xu > Souza
  - Robertson > Young
  - Robertson ∈ {#1, #2, #3, #4}.
  
  Based on the rules above, if Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then the other assignments can be made as follows:
  - Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  - Young is assigned parking space #5.
  - Togowa is assigned parking space #6.
  - Xu is assigned parking space #3.
  - Souza is assigned parking space #2.
  - Vaughn is assigned parking space #1.
  
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #1. This is not possible, because Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2. This is not possible, because Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3. This is not possible, because Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, if Xu is assigned parking space #5 or #6, then Souza must be assigned parking space #3 or #4, which means Vaughn cannot be assigned parking space #3. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
  D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4. This is true, based on the explanation above.
  E: Xu is assigned parking space #5. This is not possible, because Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Xu must be assigned parking space #3 or #4, which means Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #4. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: 
    1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

A: If Souza were assigned parking space #1, then Robertson could not be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, which violates rule 3. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
B: If Young were assigned parking space #2, then Robertson would have to be assigned parking space #1, which satisfies rule 4, and Togowa would have to be assigned parking space #3. However, Xu would also have to be assigned parking space #4, which violates rule 2. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
C: If Vaughn were assigned parking space #3, then Togowa would have to be assigned parking space #1, Robertson would have to be assigned parking space #2, and Young would have to be assigned parking space #4, which satisfies rules 1, 3, and 4. However, there are multiple valid assignments for Xu and Souza: Xu could be assigned parking space #5 and Souza could be assigned parking space #6, or Xu could be assigned parking space #6 and Souza could be assigned parking space #5. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
D: If Robertson were assigned parking space #4, then Togowa would have to be assigned parking space #1, Young would have to be assigned parking space #3, and Xu would have to be assigned parking space #5, which satisfies rules 1, 3, and 4. Souza would then have to be assigned parking space #2, which satisfies rule 2. Therefore, this choice is correct.
E: If Xu were assigned parking space #5, then Souza would have to be assigned parking space #1, which violates rule 2. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.

Analyzing the answer choices:
- If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #4, but there could be multiple valid assignments for the other employees, so this choice does not fully and uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces.
- If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, and the other employees can be assigned the remaining spaces according to the given rules. This choice fully and uniquely determines the assignment of parking spaces.
- If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, we cannot determine where the other employees will park.
- If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, but we cannot determine where the other employees will park.
- If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza must be assigned parking space #2, but we cannot determine where the other employees will park.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
  Each employee must be assigned one parking space.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young's parking space > Togowa's parking space
  Xu's parking space > Souza's parking space
  Robertson's parking space > Young's parking space
  Robertson's parking space can be #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must have parking space #3, Togowa must have parking space #1, Souza must have parking space #2, Xu must have parking space #5, and Vaughn will have parking space #6. This assignment satisfies all the rules and constraints. Therefore, the answer is D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee is assigned a unique parking space.
  Young > Togowa
  Xu > Souza
  Robertson > Young
  Robertson ∈ {1,2,3,4}
  
  A: If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This is because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, this choice is not fully and uniquely determined.
  B: If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6. This is because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. However, the assignment of parking spaces for Souza, Vaughn, and Xu is not determined. Therefore, this choice is not fully and uniquely determined.
  C: If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #6, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1. This is because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. However, the assignment of parking spaces for Souza and Xu is not determined. Therefore, this choice is not fully and uniquely determined.
  D: If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #6, and Young must be assigned parking space #5. This is because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. However, the assignment of parking spaces for Souza and Xu is not determined. Therefore, this choice is not fully and uniquely determined.
  E: If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Young must be assigned parking space #4, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, Togowa must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #2. This is because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, this choice is fully and uniquely determined.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young's parking space number must be higher than Togowa's.
  - Xu's parking space number must be higher than Souza's.
  - Robertson's parking space number must be higher than Young's.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
  - If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. In this case, there are two remaining parking spaces (#1 and #2) that can be assigned to Souza and Vaughn in any order. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - The six employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young) must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: 
    - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    
Analysis:
  We can use the last rule to reduce the possible parking spaces for Robertson to #1, #2, #3, or #4. Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, we can deduce that Robertson must be assigned parking space #4. Then, we can use the second rule to deduce that Xu must be assigned parking space #5, and Souza must be assigned parking space #2. Finally, we can use the first rule to deduce that Young is assigned parking space #6, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #1. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are chosen, then we still need to select one more botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist to form the panel. We must also be careful not to violate any of the selection rules. 
  Choice A violates the rule that F and K cannot both be selected.
  Choice B violates the rule that K and M cannot both be selected.
  Choice C is a possibility, but it doesn't guarantee the inclusion of at least one zoologist.
  Choice D violates the rule that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  Choice E is a possibility, but it doesn't guarantee the inclusion of at least one botanist.
  Therefore, the best option is to select both F and M, which gives us one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist, and satisfies all the selection rules.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The panel must have at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
To form the panel, we must select one botanist, one chemist and one zoologist to fulfill the requirement of having at least one scientist of each type. Then, we can add two more scientists that fulfill the given conditions.

If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we can select F as the botanist to fulfill the requirement of having at least one scientist of each type. Then, we can select either K or M as the chemist. If we select K, we cannot select F, so we must include M. If we select M, we must select both P and R. Therefore, the panel must include F or else M.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then there must be at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If F is not selected, then there will be two botanists, which means at most one zoologist can be selected. 
  If K is not selected, then either F or M must be selected to meet the requirement of having at least one chemist. 
  If M is not selected, then P and R cannot both be selected. 
  Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, the panel must include either F or else M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The panel must have at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected, and neither can K and M.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we know that the panel will have at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. From the given choices, A, B, and D do not guarantee this condition. C is not guaranteed to be true because it is possible that both K and M are disqualified. However, choice E is guaranteed to be true because if G and H are already selected, we need one more zoologist and P is the only remaining zoologist. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If G and H are both among the scientists selected, then at least one botanist and one zoologist must also be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If G and H are both among the scientists selected, then at least one botanist and one zoologist must also be selected. 
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which means either P or R can be selected, but not both. 
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected. 
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. 
  Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either K or M, since F cannot be selected. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are three types of scientists: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Processing:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we know that the panel must include at least one botanist, at least one chemist, and at least one zoologist. 
  We also know that F and K cannot both be selected, so we can eliminate choice A.
  We are left with B, C, D, and E.
  If we select both G and H, then we have to select at most one botanist, which means we cannot select F. This eliminates choice B.
  If we select both G and H, then we have to select at least one chemist, which means we cannot select both K and M. This eliminates choice C.
  If we select both G and H, then we have to select at least one zoologist, which means we cannot select Q if we do not select P and R. This eliminates choice D.
  If we select both G and H, then we have to select at least one botanist and one zoologist. We cannot select F, so we have to select either K or M. If we select M, then we have to select both P and R. This means that we have to select at least two zoologists, which contradicts the condition that we can select at most one zoologist if we select more than one botanist. Therefore, we cannot select M. This leaves us with only one choice:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We need to select a panel of 5 scientists from among botanists (F, G, and H), chemists (K, L, and M), and zoologists (P, Q, and R).
  Each type of scientist (botanist, chemist, and zoologist) must be represented in the panel.
  If there is more than one botanist, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we must have at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist among the remaining three scientists to be selected. 
  If F is not selected, then we must have K or M in the panel. 
  However, if K is selected, then we cannot select F, and if M is selected, we must also select P and R. 
  Therefore, the only possible answer is D: M or else Q.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are selected, the panel will have at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, if G and H are both selected, K must be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected (F and K cannot both be selected).
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, the panel could include F, G, H, K, P, and R.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  We need to form a panel of five scientists from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R.
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are selected, it means we have only one spot left to fill the panel. 
  We must select at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  
  A: F or K cannot be selected if G and H are selected.
  B: F or M can be selected if G and H are selected.
  C: K or M cannot be both selected if G and H are selected.
  D: M or Q cannot guarantee the selection of at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist if G and H are selected.
  E: P or Q cannot guarantee the selection of at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist if G and H are selected.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist from each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
  If G and H are selected, then we need to determine the possible scientists that must be included in the panel. The panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
  If neither F nor K is selected, then we must select at least one botanist from G and H. We cannot select more than one zoologist. So, the zoologist must be either P or R. We can select any of the three chemists. 
  If we select F, then we must select at most one zoologist, so the zoologist must be either P or R. We can select any of the three chemists.
  If we select K, then we cannot select F, so we must select at most one zoologist, so the zoologist must be either P or R. We can select either G or H.
  If we select M, then we must select both P and R. We cannot select F, so we must select at most one zoologist, so the zoologist must be either P or R. We cannot select K. So, the only remaining botanist is H. Therefore, the panel must include H, M, P, and R.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. 
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Elimination:
  A: Kim and Mahr cannot both be working in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  B: Tiao is already assigned to Zone 2, so he cannot be assigned to Zone 3, and Kim cannot be assigned to any zone because all zones have at least one representative assigned.
  C: Parra and Quinn cannot be working in Zone 3 because Parra is assigned to Zone 1.
  D: Stuckey and Udall are both assigned to Zone 3, but Tiao cannot be assigned to Zone 3 because he is assigned to Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
  Parra and Quinn are assigned to the same zone, so they are either both assigned to Zone 2 or both assigned to Zone 3. If they are assigned to Zone 2, then Udall must also be assigned to Zone 2, which would violate the constraint that Tiao and Udall cannot both be assigned to the same zone. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must both be assigned to Zone 3. Since Stuckey and Udall are assigned to the same zone, they must also be assigned to Zone 3. Thus, the complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are exactly seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that at least one of Parra and Tiao works in Zone 1, and at least one of Tiao and Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3, and neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 3. So, at most four sales representatives can work in Zone 3. We also know that Parra and Quinn, as well as Stuckey and Udall, work in the same sales zone as each other. So, if any of them work in Zone 3, the other person must also work in Zone 3.
  
Solutions:
  A: Kim, Mahr - This is not possible, as there must be at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  B: Kim, Tiao - This is not possible, as Tiao cannot work in Zone 3.
  C: Parra, Quinn - This is not possible, as there must be at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This is not possible, as Tiao cannot work in Zone 3.
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - This is the only option that is possible, as all four sales representatives can work in Zone 3, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The company employs exactly seven sales representatives.
  The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Elimination:
  A: Kim and Mahr cannot be the sales representatives working in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  B: Tiao cannot be the only sales representative working in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  C: Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  E: Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so at least two of them must work in the same sales zone as each other, which means they cannot all work in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis: 
  From the given information, we know that Parra or Tiao can work in Zone 1, so they cannot work in Zone 3. Similarly, Tiao or Udall can work in Zone 2, so they cannot work in Zone 3. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, but they cannot work in Zone 1 or 2. This means that both of them work in Zone 3, and there is at least one more sales representative working in Zone 3. Finally, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone. Therefore, if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3. This would leave Kim, Mahr, and Tiao to work in Zone 2, which contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3 with Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall. This would leave Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 2, which satisfies the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  We need to find a list of the sales representatives who could be working in Zone 3.
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so we can eliminate options A, B, and C because they only have one or two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Option D has three sales representatives working in Zone 3, which is possible, but we need to check if the other conditions are satisfied.
  Option E has all four sales representatives working in Zone 3, which is also possible, and it satisfies the other conditions because Parra and Quinn, as well as Stuckey and Udall, work in the same sales zone.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The sales representatives are Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  A: Kim and Mahr cannot both be in Zone 3, because if they were, then there would be more representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3.
  B: Tiao is already assigned to Zone 2, so he cannot be in Zone 3.
  C: Parra and Quinn are in the same sales zone, but they are not both in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao and Udall cannot both be in Zone 3, because then there would be more representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3. However, Stuckey can be in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: The only remaining option is E, where Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall are in Zone 3, and Kim, Mahr, and Tiao are in Zone 1 and Zone 2.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs seven sales representatives to work in its three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  A: Kim, Mahr - Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it's impossible to have only two representatives working in Zone 3.
  B: Kim, Tiao - Tiao cannot work in Zone 3 because Tiao works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra, Quinn - Parra and Quinn cannot work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - Tiao cannot work in Zone 3 because Tiao works in Zone 2. So, only Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3, which is not more than the number of sales representatives working in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  The company employs exactly seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  From the given options, only D and E have three sales representatives, which is required for Zone 3 because it has more sales representatives than Zone 2. We can eliminate option E because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot be in Zone 3. Thus, the only possible option is D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs seven sales representatives to work in its three sales zones.
  Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
- In option A, neither Kim nor Mahr can work in Zone 3 because there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- In option B, Tiao works in Zone 2, so he cannot work in Zone 3.
- In option C, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot work in Zone 3 together.
- Option E includes all seven sales representatives, which is not possible because there are only six sales representatives left after Parra or Tiao and Tiao or Udall are assigned to Zones 1 and 2, respectively.

Action: Answer("D")  
Option D, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall can work in Zone 3 while Kim, Mahr, Parra, and Quinn work in Zone 1 and Zone 2.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives in total.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Elimination:
  A: Kim and Mahr cannot both work in Zone 3 because there would be more sales representatives working in Zone 2 than in Zone 3.
  B: Kim works in Zone 1 or Zone 3, but Tiao cannot work in both Zone 2 and Zone 3. So, this combination is not possible.
  C: Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, but this combination does not have enough sales representatives for Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, and Tiao works in Zone 2, leaving no sales representative for Zone 1. So, this combination is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
  Explanation: This combination satisfies all the given conditions. Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in another zone. Kim, Mahr, and Tiao work in Zone 3, which has more sales representatives than Zone 2.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. 
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis: 
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, that means the following must be true:
  - One kind of cookie's first batch is made on Monday or Wednesday.
  - Another kind of cookie's third batch is made on Wednesday or Friday.
  - The above two batches are made on the same day.
  
  Based on the above, we can eliminate options A, B, and E because they are true regardless of whether one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch. The remaining options are C and D. 
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on Monday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, making option C true. 
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on Wednesday, then at least two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, making option D false. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - A bakery makes three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: 
- We can use logic to determine the possible days when the batches of cookies are made. 
- If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the possible pairs are:
  - oatmeal first batch and sugar third batch, which means oatmeal first batch could be made on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday
  - peanut butter first batch and oatmeal third batch, which means peanut butter first batch and oatmeal third batch could be made on Wednesday or Friday
  - sugar first batch and peanut butter third batch, which means sugar first batch could be made on Tuesday or Wednesday
- Let's check each option to see which one could be false:
  - A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. This is true since there are 9 batches to be made and 5 days to make them.
  - B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. This is true since oatmeal first batch and peanut butter third batch could be made on Wednesday.
  - C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. This is false since we know at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and there could be more than one batches on Monday.
  - D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. This is false since the only batch that could be made on Tuesday is sugar first batch.
  - E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. This is false since there could be more than one batches on Friday.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Analysis:
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then there are two possible cases to consider:
  1. Oatmeal's first batch is made on Thursday.
  2. Oatmeal's first batch is made on Friday.

  In the first case, we can see that the first batch of peanut butter cookies will be made on Thursday, and the third batch of sugar cookies will be made on Wednesday. This means that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (condition given), at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days (because we know which batches are made on which days), exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (oatmeal's second batch and sugar's first batch), at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (oatmeal's third batch and peanut butter's second batch), and exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday (sugar's third batch). Therefore, Option C "Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday" is false.

  In the second case, we can see that the first batch of peanut butter cookies will be made on Friday, and the third batch of sugar cookies will be made on Wednesday. This means that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (condition given), at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days (because we know which batches are made on which days), exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (oatmeal's second batch and sugar's first batch), at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (oatmeal's third batch and peanut butter's second batch), and exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday (sugar's third batch). Therefore, Option E "Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday" is false.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  3. Each batch of cookies is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  4. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  5. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  6. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  7. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Explanation: 
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of either oatmeal or peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the third batch of either oatmeal or peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday. Thus, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday, and the second batch of oatmeal/peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday. This means that only one batch of cookies is made on Friday, so the statement "Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday" could be false. Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  Let's assume that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Monday. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday. If sugar cookies are made on Wednesday, then the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday and the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday. In this case, all choices are true. 
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday and the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday. In this case, the only false statement is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The following is known, 
    1. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
    2. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
    3. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Analysis: 
  We know that there are three kinds of cookies and three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday to Friday).
  The first batch of each type of cookie can be made on any of the five days.
  The second batch of oatmeal is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, it means that the first batch of one type of cookie and the third batch of another type of cookie are made on the same day.
  From the given conditions, we can conclude that the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which means that the third batch of oatmeal cookies will be made on the same day as the second batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, the only option that could be false is C because if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it is possible that more than one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
Choices:
  A: Quinn
  B: Ruiz
  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The project leader must be one of the three project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Action: Answer("A") 

If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. Since Ruiz cannot be a project member unless he is the project leader, it must be that Quinn is a project member. And since Taylor is not a project member, by the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be, it follows that Smith is not a project member. Therefore, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member due to the constraint that if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. This means that it must be that Wells is a project member. Thus, the three project members are Quinn, Taylor, and Wells. Therefore, the answer is A: Quinn.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Quinn or Ruiz are selected, one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  
To satisfy all the constraints, the selected workers must be:
  1. Quinn or Ruiz as project leader, and
  2. Smith and Taylor, and
  3. Wells and Xue (since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected if Wells is selected).

If Taylor is not a project member, then the selected workers must be:
  1. Quinn or Ruiz as project leader, and
  2. Smith,
  3. Wells and Xue.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, Wells must be a project member, and neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Thus, either Quinn or Xue must be the project leader.
Choices:
  A: Quinn - If Quinn is a project member, Quinn must be the project leader. But Quinn can be a project member only if leading the project, which creates a contradiction.
  B: Ruiz - If Ruiz is a project member, Ruiz must be the project leader. But Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, which creates a contradiction.
  C: Verma - Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is a project member. Thus, Verma cannot be a project member.
  D: Wells - If Wells is a project member, Wells cannot be the project leader. Thus, Wells cannot be the correct answer.
  E: Xue - If Xue is a project member, Xue must be the project leader. Thus, Xue is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The project will consist of exactly three workers and one of them will be the leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then that person must be the leader.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member because Taylor must be a project member if Smith is selected.
  
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then the third member of the project must be one of the following: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, or Xue.
  
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then they must be the leader, which means that two of the three workers selected must be Quinn or Ruiz and Taylor. However, we know that Taylor cannot be selected. Therefore, Quinn and Ruiz cannot be selected.
  
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Therefore, the other two members of the project must be selected from Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue. Since Taylor cannot be selected, the other two members of the project must be Smith, Wells, and Xue. Therefore, the answer is D: Wells.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be one of Quinn or Ruiz.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  We need to find which worker must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member either. 
  This is because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  This means that Wells cannot be a project member, because if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, the remaining workers who can be project members are Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, and Xue.
  However, Quinn and Ruiz can only be project members if one of them is the project leader.
  Since we do not know who the project leader is, we cannot say for certain whether Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  Therefore, the only worker who must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member is Verma.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three workers and one leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, that person has to be the leader.
  If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either because if Smith were a project member, Taylor would have to be as well. This means that the remaining two project members cannot be Wells and either Ruiz or Verma. If we select Wells, we cannot select either Ruiz or Verma. This leaves only three possible sets of project members: {Quinn, Ruiz, Xue}, {Quinn, Verma, Xue}, or {Ruiz, Verma, Xue}. But we can eliminate {Quinn, Ruiz, Xue} because if Quinn or Ruiz is selected, that person has to be the leader. Therefore, the remaining possible project teams are {Quinn, Verma, Xue} and {Ruiz, Verma, Xue}. In both cases, Verma is a project member. Hence, 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the seven workers will be selected for the project. One of the project members will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member as per the condition "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be". Therefore, only two workers, namely (Quinn, Ruiz) or (Wells, Verma) can be project members. 

If (Quinn, Ruiz) are the project members, then either Quinn or Ruiz will be the project leader. Therefore, Taylor cannot be the project leader as he is not a project member.

If (Wells, Verma) are the project members, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member as per the condition "If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be". Therefore, the remaining workers (Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue) must be the project members. Since one of the project members will be the leader, any of the four remaining workers can be the leader.

Action: Answer("A") 
Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, Quinn must be a project member.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis: 
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, the project members will be three workers from the remaining five workers, which are Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, so Wells cannot be the project leader. Therefore, the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz. If Quinn or Ruiz is not a project member, then there will only be two project members, which is against the given constraint that exactly three workers will be project members. Therefore, both Quinn and Ruiz must be project members. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly 3 members and 1 leader.
  Quinn and Ruiz can only be members if they are the leader.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must be a member.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a member.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member. 
  This means we cannot use the constraint "If Smith is a member, then Taylor must be a member."
  We also know that exactly 3 workers will be selected for the project.
  We have to select the workers in such a way that no constraints are violated.
  We also have to make sure that exactly one of the selected workers will be the project leader.
  
Solution:
  Let's consider each worker one by one.
  If Quinn is a project member, then Quinn must be the project leader. This means Ruiz cannot be a member and we cannot have a third member because Verma cannot be a member if Wells is a member. This violates the constraint that exactly 3 workers will be selected for the project. So, Quinn cannot be a project member.
  If Ruiz is a project member, then Ruiz must be the project leader. This means Quinn cannot be a member and we cannot have a third member because Verma cannot be a member if Wells is a member. This violates the constraint that exactly 3 workers will be selected for the project. So, Ruiz cannot be a project member.
  If Verma is a project member, then Wells cannot be a member. This means that we cannot have a third member because Quinn and Ruiz can only be members if they are the leader. So, Verma cannot be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a member. This means we can only have two members - Wells and Xue. But we need exactly 3 members for the project. So, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Xue is a project member, we need two more members. We cannot have Quinn or Ruiz as members because they can only be members if they are the leader. We cannot have Verma as a member because Wells cannot be a member if Verma is a member. So, we can only have Smith and Taylor as members. This means Xue will be the project leader. So, Answer("E") is the correct answer.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly 3 members and one, and only one, of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a member only if one of them is leading the project.
  If Smith is a member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member because if Smith were a member, then Taylor would have to be a member, which is not the case. Therefore, we are left with the following possibilities for the project members: {Quinn, Ruiz}, {Wells}, {Verma}, {Smith, Wells, Ruiz}, {Smith, Wells, Quinn}.
  However, we know that if Wells is a project member, then neither Verma nor Ruiz can be a project member. Therefore, the only possibility left is {Smith, Wells, Quinn}.
  Therefore, Quinn must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Veqemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon
  C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy
  D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than, wellspring
  E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Vegemite performs in slot 3, then Yardsign must perform in slot 1 or 2.
  If Vegemite performs in slot 3, then Zircon must perform in slot 5 or 6.
  If Wellspring performs in slot 4 or 5, then Xpert will perform in slot 6.
  If Xpert performs in slot 4 or 5, then Wellspring will perform in slot 3.
  If Uneasy performs in slot 6, then Wellspring and Zircon will perform in slots 3 and 4 in some order.

Analysis:
  If Vegemite performs in slot 3, then Yardsign must perform in slot 1 or 2. This eliminates options C, D, and E since they do not involve Yardsign performing in an earlier slot than Vegemite.
  If Vegemite performs in slot 3, then Zircon must perform in slot 5 or 6. This eliminates option A since it would require Xpert to perform in slot 5, which would violate the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon perform before Xpert.
  This leaves option B as the only valid choice.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The six bands are Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are six slots, numbered from one to six.
  - There are six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band must perform in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that Zircon must perform in a later slot, either in slot four, five or six. This means Wellspring must also perform in a later slot than Vegemite, which leaves only slots two and one for Wellspring. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, Xpert must perform in a later slot than slot three. This means Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, which leaves only slots four, five, and six for Uneasy. Finally, since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, and slots one and two are already taken, Yardsign must perform in slot three.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands - Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon are performing in the concert.
  - The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  - As Vegemite performs in slot three, the possible arrangement of the six bands can be:
    Slot 1: Yardsign or Wellspring
    Slot 2: Yardsign or Wellspring
    Slot 3: Vegemite
    Slot 4: Uneasy, Xpert, or Zircon
    Slot 5: Uneasy, Xpert, or Zircon
    Slot 6: Uneasy, Xpert, or Zircon
  - From the given constraints, we can conclude that Uneasy, Xpert, or Zircon will perform in the last three slots.
  - Yardsign or Wellspring will perform in the first two slots.
 
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if Vegemite performs in slot three, it must be true that Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Vegemite performs in slot three, Yardsign will perform in slot one or two.
  - Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, they must perform in slots one and two.
  - Therefore, Xpert will perform in slot four, Uneasy will perform in slot five, and Zircon will perform in slot six.
  - The only statement that is necessarily true is that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  
Action: Answer("B")

  - Six slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, Yardsign must perform in slot one or two. However, Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, which means Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six. Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slot two and one, respectively. As Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, it means Wellspring performs in slot 2, and Zircon performs in slot 1. According to the constraints, Xpert must perform in slot 4 or slot 5. Thus, Uneasy performs in slot 6. Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot 2, and Wellspring performs in slot 3. Hence, the correct answer is D, which states that "Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring."
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are six slots numbered from one to six.
  - The six bands are Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band performs in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Vegemite performs in slot three, the first three slots are already filled with Vegemite, Yardsign, and one of the four remaining bands, leaving the last three slots for the remaining three bands, including Uneasy.
  - The constraints do not provide any information that would allow us to determine which of the last three slots Uneasy will perform in.
  - However, we can determine that Uneasy will perform in one of the last three slots, and that Yardsign will perform in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Zircon performs after Vegemite, so the only possible order for the last three slots is Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are six slots numbered slot one through slot six.
  The six bands are Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Veqemite performs in slot three.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or slot two.
  Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, it is possible that Uneasy performs in slot four, slot five, or slot six.
  Since Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, Zircon must perform in slot four, slot five, or slot six.
  If Zircon performs in slot six, then Wellspring must perform in slot four or slot five. Therefore, Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Zircon performs in slot five, then Wellspring must perform in slot four. Therefore, Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Zircon performs in slot four, then Wellspring must perform in slot three. Therefore, Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, it must be true that Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring. Answer choice D is the only option that matches this conclusion.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.

Analysis:
  If Vegemite is in slot 3, then Yardsign must be in slot 1 or slot 2.
  Xpert is in slot 6, so either Zircon or Wellspring will be in slot 5.

A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. - There is no constraint that indicates Uneasy must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon - Possible, but not necessarily true.
C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy - False. Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring - There is no constraint that indicates Yardsign must perform in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy - False. Vegemite performs in slot three, so Zircon must perform in slot six.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
  A: We don't know where Uneasy performs, so we can't determine if it performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. 
  B: Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slot one or two. If Wellspring performed in slot one, and Zircon performed in slot two, then Xpert must perform in slot three, and Uneasy would have to perform in slot four, five, or six. Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot two, and Zircon in slot one. 
  C: Xpert must perform in slot four, five, or six. 
  D: Yardsign must perform in slot one or two, but we don't know where Wellspring performs.
  E: Zircon performs in slot one.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

Elimination:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so none of the options can have Peters recruited earlier.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas and White must be recruited in the last two spots.

Analysis:
  - Since White was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must be recruited last, and Rovero must be recruited before Tao, and White must be recruited before Villas.
  - Quinn was recruited before Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited last, and Rovero must be recruited before Quinn.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited first or seventh. Therefore, Stanton must be recruited in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. Peters was recruited fourth.
  6. White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  7. Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Using the given information, we can establish the following order of recruitment:
1. Quinn
2. Villas
3. White
4. Peters
5. Rovero
6. Tao
7. Stanton

If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must have been recruited sixth, just after Rovero. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the seven accomplices is Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited right before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  White was recruited before Rovero, and Rovero was recruited before Tao.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we know that Tao was recruited sixth as Rovero was recruited before Tao. Also, White was recruited before Rovero, which means White was recruited before Tao as well. Therefore, Quinn, Peters, Stanton, Villas were recruited before Tao.
  As per the information given, Quinn was recruited before Rovero, which means Quinn was recruited first or second. Peters was recruited fourth and Villas immediately before White. Thus, the only possible option is that Rovero was recruited third, and Stanton was recruited second. Therefore, the answer is B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices, one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  White was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao. Therefore, Tao is the last person to be recruited.
  Peters was recruited fourth, which means that Tao is the seventh person to be recruited.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must be the sixth person to be recruited.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be one of the first three to be recruited.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Therefore, Stanton must be one of the first three to be recruited.
  The only choice that is consistent with these facts is that Rovero was recruited third.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must have been recruited last or sixth. 
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn and Stanton must have been recruited before Peters.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited fifth.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited first, Stanton was recruited second, and Rovero was recruited third.
  The only option that could be true is D: Tao was recruited sixth.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven accomplices: Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  Each accomplice was recruited one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is not in a reverse order.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  White was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Analysis:
  According to the given information:
  White > Rovero > Tao
  Quinn > Rovero
  Villas > White
  Peters is fourth
  From this information, we can determine that the order of recruitment must be: Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Peters, Stanton, Tao.
  Therefore, option B is correct.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  We know that White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao. Therefore, we can form the following order: [Villas], [White], [Rovero], [Peters], [?], [Stanton], [Tao]. 
  We can see that Quinn was recruited either first, second, or third. If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero could not have been recruited third. If Quinn was recruited second, then Villas could not have been recruited immediately before White. Therefore, Quinn must have been recruited third. We can now form the following order: [Villas], [White], [Quinn], [Rovero], [Peters], [?], [Stanton], [Tao].
  Stanton could not have been recruited second, because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao. Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited sixth, and Tao must have been recruited last. We can now form the following order: [Villas], [White], [Quinn], [Rovero], [Peters], [Stanton], [Tao].
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Process of elimination:
  - Choice A is not possible because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Choice B is possible because Peters was recruited fourth, and Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Choice C is not possible because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  - Choice D is not possible because Tao was recruited after Rovero, and Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Choice E is not possible because Tao was recruited after Rovero, and Villas was recruited immediately before White.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then White was recruited earlier than Tao and Rovero.
  
Process of elimination:
  A: There is no information that suggests Quinn was the first to be recruited.
  B: Peters was recruited fourth, so Rovero cannot be recruited third.
  C: The order of recruitment for Quinn and Stanton is not established, so there is no information that suggests Stanton was recruited second.
  D: If Tao was recruited sixth, then White and Rovero would have to be recruited earlier than Tao, which contradicts the given information that White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  E: If Villas was recruited sixth, then White would have to be recruited seventh, which contradicts the given information that Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
- Peters was recruited fourth, so the order is Peters-?-?-?-?-?-White.
- Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao. So, there are at least two people between them. 
- Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. So, Quinn must be among the first three to be recruited.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White.
- White was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
- Therefore, the order must be: Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Peters, Stanton, Tao.

Action: Answer('D') 
Since Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, and Tao was recruited sixth, then this is a possible order.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly eight books are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  Using the given conditions, we can infer that:
  - The top shelf has at most 2 books.
  - The middle shelf has at least 2 books (because I is on it).
  - The bottom shelf has at least 3 books (because there are at least 2 on each shelf and more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf).
  - Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F is on the same shelf as M, both books must be either on the top or middle shelf.
  
  Therefore, the only option that could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf is B: F, H, M. 
  This satisfies all the given conditions, since F and M are on the same shelf, and both H and F are placed on the bottom shelf. 
  Choice A is not possible because M would need to be on the same shelf as F, but not with H. 
  Choice C is not possible since K cannot be on the bottom shelf. 
  Choice D is not possible since O cannot be on the bottom shelf. 
  Choice E is not possible since L cannot be on the bottom shelf. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: F and M are placed on the same shelf, so it can't be the bottom shelf where more books are placed.
  B: F and M are placed on the same shelf, so it can't be the bottom shelf where more books are placed.
  C: G, H, and K are not on the same shelf as F, so it can't be the bottom shelf where more books are placed.
  D: O is not placed on the same shelf as F and M, so it can't be the bottom shelf where more books are placed.
  E: G, H, and L are not on the same shelf as F and M, so it can't be the bottom shelf where more books are placed.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")  
The answer is "none of the above" because there is not enough information to determine which books are placed on the bottom shelf.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - From the given conditions, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so it can't be on the top or the bottom shelf.
  - We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K can't be on the bottom shelf if F is on the same shelf as M.
  - Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, L can't be on the top shelf, so it must be either on the middle or the bottom shelf.
  - Since there are at least two books on each shelf and we know that I is on the middle shelf, there must be at least two books on the top shelf and at least two books on the bottom shelf.
  - From the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we know that there are more than two books on the bottom shelf.
  - From the condition that F is placed on the same shelf as M, we know that F and M must be on the same shelf, which could be either the top or the bottom shelf.
  - Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least three books, and one of them must be either F or M.
  - Based on these conditions, the only possible answer is B: F, H, M.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are exactly three shelves, and at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - There are more books on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - From the given conditions, we know that I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf. This eliminates options C, D, and E.
  - We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so F cannot be on the top shelf. This eliminates option A.
  - We know that there are more books on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. This eliminates option B.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  Option A: This option lists only two books, which is not enough because the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf. Eliminate.
  Option B: This option lists F, H, and M. We know that F and M are on the same shelf, therefore, they cannot be placed on different shelves. Eliminate.
  Option C: This option lists G, H, and K. We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, therefore, K cannot be placed on the middle shelf. Eliminate.
  Option D: This option lists F, G, M, and O. We know that F and M are on the same shelf, therefore, they cannot be placed on different shelves. This option also does not fulfill the condition that the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf. Eliminate.
  Option E: This option lists G, H, L, and M. We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, therefore, L cannot be placed on the middle shelf. Also, this option fulfills the condition that the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf. Therefore, this is the correct answer.

  F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: Cannot be true since there are at least two books on each shelf.
  B: Cannot be true since F and M must be on different shelves.
  C: Cannot be true since K is not on the bottom shelf.
  D: Could be true since F, G, M, and O could be on the top and middle shelves, while the remaining books H, I, K, and L are on the bottom shelf.
  E: Cannot be true since L is not on the bottom shelf.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - There are eight books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - At least two books are on each shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that I, F and M are not on the bottom shelf.
  - We know that O is not on the bottom shelf since it is on a higher shelf than L.
  - We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K is not on the bottom shelf.
  - That leaves us with G and H as possible books on the bottom shelf.
  - Since at least two books are on each shelf, we need another book on the bottom shelf to accompany G or H.
  - F cannot be on the bottom shelf because it is on the same shelf as M.
  - That leaves us with only one choice: G, H, and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
- There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
- At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
- More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
- From the statement "More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf", we know that there are at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
- F is on the same shelf as M, so they must be both on the top, both on the middle, or both on the bottom shelf.
- K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
- O is on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf with L.

Answer:
- Since we know that there are at least 3 books on the bottom shelf and that F cannot be on the bottom shelf with K and O, we can eliminate choices A and B.
- Choice C has none of the books on the bottom shelf that are on the same shelf as M, so it cannot be correct.
- Choice D has all the books on the bottom shelf except for F and M, which are on the same shelf. This satisfies all the conditions, so it is a possible list of books on the bottom shelf.
- Choice E has none of the books on the bottom shelf that are on the same shelf as M, so it cannot be correct.
- Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, M, O.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: F and M cannot be on the bottom shelf because F is on the same shelf as M, and F is not on the top shelf.
  B: H cannot be on the bottom shelf because there are at least two books on each shelf.
  C: G, H, K cannot be on the bottom shelf because K is not on the bottom shelf.
  D: This could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf. F, G, and M cannot be on the top shelf, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O and L cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, F, G, M, and O must be on the middle and bottom shelves, and the remaining books, H and I, must be on the top shelf.
  E: G, H, L, and M cannot be on the bottom shelf because F is not on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Using the given information, we can deduce some facts:
  - I must be on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - K is higher than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf and F cannot be on the top shelf.
  - O is higher than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf and L cannot be on the top shelf.
  - F and M are on the same shelf, so they must either both be on the top shelf or both be on the bottom shelf.

Let's consider each option:
  A: F, M - This is not possible because there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  B: F, H, M - This is not possible because H and M cannot both be on the bottom shelf as there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  C: G, H, K - This is not possible because K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  D: F, G, M, O - This is possible. F and M are on the bottom shelf, G is on the middle shelf, and O is on the top shelf.
  E: G, H, L, M - This is not possible because L cannot be on the bottom shelf.

  There are six cookbooks (K, L, M, N, O, and P) that will be published over the course of the next year.
  Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

Action: Answer("D")

If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring, has the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Both conditions link M and N together and ensure that they are not published in the same season.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P— over the course of the next year. 
  Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions:
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. 
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other. 
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. 
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
  If we substitute any of the choices and the effect on the schedule for publication of the cookbooks remains unchanged, then it means that the choice has the same effect as the original condition that "if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring."
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: 
  To have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks, the chosen condition should also affect the publication schedule of M and N. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A, B, and C because they do not involve M and N. 
  Choice D would not work because it would affect only N and not M. 
  Choice E would not work because it would affect only O and N. 
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The conditions are: 
  - M and P cannot be in the same season
  - K and N must be in the same season
  - If K is in the fall, then O must be in the fall too
  - If M is in the fall, then N must be in the spring
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
Option D creates the same effect as the given condition, that is, if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This is because K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are six cookbooks (K, L, M, N, O, P) to be published in the fall or spring.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  - K and N must be published in the same season.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

Analysis:
  We are asked to find the option that has the same effect as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that N cannot be published in the fall if M is published in the fall. Therefore, if we substitute this condition with another condition that prevents N from being published in the fall if M is published in the fall, we will have the same effect on the publication schedule.

A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. (This condition does not affect the publication of N in the fall if M is published in the fall.)
B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. (This condition does not affect the publication of N in the spring if M is published in the fall.)
C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. (This condition does not affect the publication of N in the fall if M is published in the fall.)
D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. (This condition does not prevent N from being published in the fall if M is published in the fall.)
E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. (This condition does not affect the publication of N in the fall if M is published in the fall.)

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The original condition is that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring - this condition does not provide any information about N and its season of publication.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall - this condition does not provide any information about M and its season of publication, but affects P.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall - this condition does not provide any information about N and its season of publication, but affects P.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring - this condition is equivalent to the original condition, but with the seasons reversed.
  E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring - this condition does not provide any information about M and its season of publication, but affects N.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—that will be published in two seasons—fall or spring—subject to certain conditions.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  Choice A is incorrect because it does not have the same effect as the original condition. 
  Choice B is incorrect because it does not have the same effect as the original condition. 
  Choice C is incorrect because it does not have the same effect as the original condition. 
  Choice D has the same effect as the original condition - if N is published in the spring, then M must also be published in the spring, and vice versa. 
  Choice E is incorrect because it does not have the same effect as the original condition.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The original condition is that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season, and if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring to ensure that they are published in different seasons.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This does not have the same effect because it only specifies when M must be published, but it does not affect the publication of any other cookbook.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This does not have the same effect because it does not affect the publication of M and P, and it does not affect the publication of K and N.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This does not have the same effect because it only affects the publication of P, but it does not affect the publication of any other cookbook.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This has the same effect because it ensures that M and N are published in different seasons, regardless of which season each is published in.
  E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This does not have the same effect because it only affects the publication of N and O, but it does not affect the publication of any other cookbook.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D") 
The given condition "If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring" is a conditional rule. It means that if one happens, the other must happen as well. The only answer choice that has an equivalent conditional rule is D, which states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Each wall has exactly two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene cannot have any paintings on walls 2 or 3, and neither can Hidalgo.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil, and one watercolor.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we can infer:
  - Isaacs's oil is not on wall 2 (because he cannot have both his oil and watercolor on the same wall).
  - Isaacs's oil is not on wall 1 (because Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 1 and Isaacs's oil cannot be on the same wall as his watercolor).
  - Isaacs's oil is not on wall 3 (because Franz's oil is already on wall 3).
  - Isaacs's oil must be on wall 4 (because his oil must be displayed somewhere and it is not on walls 1, 2, or 3).
  - Greene's oil must be on wall 1 (because Franz's oil is on wall 3 and Greene's oil cannot be on the same wall as Isaacs's oil or watercolor).
  Therefore, the answer is (B) Greene's oil.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Each of the four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  2. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1 because:
  - Wall 4 has Isaacs's oil and no other painting by Isaacs can be displayed on any other wall.
  - Wall 2 has Isaacs's watercolor and no other painting by Isaacs can be displayed on any other wall.
  - Wall 3 has Franz's oil and no other painting by Franz can be displayed on any other wall.
  - Wall 1 must have one painting by Greene because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor, in upper and lower positions.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: 
  - If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's oil must be on wall 4.
  - If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 1, since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Therefore, either Greene's oil or Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1, and the other one must be on wall 2, with the corresponding watercolors in the opposite positions.
  - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, Greene's oil must be on wall 1 in the lower position, and Hidalgo's oil must be on wall 2 in the upper position.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 4 students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student has 2 paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  Each wall has exactly 2 paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors.
  No wall has the work of only one student.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  
  To satisfy the conditions, we can deduce that:
  - Wall 1 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
  - Wall 1 cannot have only watercolors.
  - Wall 1 cannot have the work of only one student.
  - Wall 1 cannot have Hidalgo's oil because Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3 and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - Therefore, the only possible option to be displayed on wall 1 is Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  We are given that there are 4 art students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) and each will display exactly 2 paintings (an oil and a watercolor). 
  There are 4 walls (1, 2, 3, and 4), each displaying exactly 2 paintings (one in the upper position and one in the lower position).
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  We are given that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  
Analysis:
  Since Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4, none of his paintings can be displayed on wall 1 or 3.
  Since Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, none of his paintings can be displayed on wall 1 or 4.
  Since no wall can have only watercolors, we know that one of the paintings displayed on wall 1 must be an oil painting.
  Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, we know that the paintings displayed on wall 1 cannot both be by Hidalgo.
  Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, we know that neither of Franz's paintings nor Isaacs's oil can be displayed on wall 1.
  Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, we know that Greene's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or 4.
  Therefore, the only option left is Hidalgo's watercolor to be displayed on wall 1.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will display exactly two paintings each—an oil and a watercolor.
  2. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls, with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  8. Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  
  Based on the given information, Hidalgo cannot have both paintings displayed on wall 1 because no wall can have the work of only one student, and neither Franz nor Isaacs's paintings can be on wall 1 because wall 1 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, the only possible option for wall 1 is Greene's oil. Additionally, since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 4. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- There are four walls (1, 2, 3, 4) in the exhibition room, and two paintings (an oil and a watercolor) will be displayed on each wall (one in the upper position and one in the lower position).
- Four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will each display exactly two paintings.
- No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
- No wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
- No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C") 

If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1. This is because of the given condition that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Since Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3. Therefore, the remaining painting that Greene will display must be the oil painting, which would be displayed on wall 1.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The exhibition room has 4 walls and each will have exactly 2 paintings.
  Each student will display exactly 2 paintings - one oil and one watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: 
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor should be on wall 1 and Hidalgo's oil should be on wall 4. The remaining options are Hidalgo's watercolor and Greene's oil. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Greene's oil must be on either wall 2 or 3. But the question states that Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, so Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 3. Therefore, the only option left for wall 1 is Greene's oil.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The seminar has 8 students.
  Exactly 6 students will give oral reports.
  The reports will be given over 3 consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
  Exactly 2 reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

George, Nina, and Robert will give reports and they do so on different days from one another. This means that:
  1. George gives his report on Tuesday.
  2. Nina and Robert each give their reports on a different day from Tuesday.
  3. Nina's report cannot be on Monday since Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day (Tuesday) if Nina's report is on Monday.
  4. Nina's report cannot be on Wednesday since this would mean that no one can give a report on Wednesday.
  
A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday. It is possible since Helen hasn't been assigned a specific day yet.
B: Nina gives a report on Monday. Impossible since Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day (Tuesday) if Nina's report is on Monday.
C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday. Impossible since George already has to give a report on Tuesday.
D: Olivia gives a report on Monday. Impossible since Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday. Impossible since Robert cannot give an afternoon report.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Analysis:
  1. George cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday, so George must give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, then George must give a morning report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday, but she can give a report on Wednesday.
  4. Since George and Nina have already given reports, then Robert must give a report either on Monday or Tuesday.
  5. If Robert gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, but there is only one morning report available, which means that one of them will have to give an afternoon report, contradicting rule 4.
  6. Therefore, Robert gives a report on Tuesday, which means that Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday, so Nina's report must be on Monday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Six of the eight students give a report on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
- Two reports are given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- George gives a report only on Tuesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Working from the answer choices:
A: If Helen gives a report on Wednesday, then there would be no one left to give a report on Monday. This is not possible since exactly two reports are given each day.
B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday since Nina's report cannot be followed by Helen and Irving's reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This would leave no one available to give a report on Wednesday. This is not possible since exactly two reports are given each day.
C: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then there would be no one left to give a report on Wednesday. This is not possible since exactly two reports are given each day.
D: If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Robert could not give a report on Tuesday or Wednesday since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. This means that George would have to give a report on Monday, which is not possible since George gives a report only on Tuesday.
E: If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then George would have to give a report on Tuesday, and Nina would have to give a report on Monday. This leaves Helen and Irving to give reports on Tuesday since Nina's report cannot be followed by Helen and Irving's reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This scenario satisfies all the given conditions.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

To answer the question, we need to determine which answer choice could be true given that George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days from one another.

Solution:
If George, Nina, and Robert give reports, then we know that:
- George gives a report on Tuesday (given in the knowledge).
- Nina gives a report on Monday or Wednesday (given in the knowledge).
- Robert gives a report on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday (not given in the knowledge).

Now, let's go through each answer choice:
A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
If George gives a report on Tuesday and Robert gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then there are no students left to give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give a report on Tuesday (given in the knowledge). However, since George already gives a report on Tuesday, this is not possible. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give a report on Wednesday (given in the knowledge). Since George already gives a report on Tuesday and Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday (given in the knowledge), this is not possible. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Robert must give a report on Wednesday (given in the knowledge). Since Nina already gives a report on either Monday or Wednesday, this means that George must give a report on Tuesday and Helen and Irving must both give a report on Tuesday (given in the knowledge). This is possible, so this choice could be true.

E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday (given in the knowledge). Therefore, Nina must give a report on Monday, which means that George must give a report on Tuesday and Helen and Irving must both give a report on Wednesday (given in the knowledge). This is possible, so this choice could be true.

Answer: Answer("D") or "Olivia gives a report on Monday." or Answer("E") or "Robert gives a report on Wednesday."
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Only six out of eight students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
  2. Two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then:
  1. George must give his report on Tuesday.
  2. If Nina gives a report, then she cannot give it on Tuesday. Thus, she can give her report only on Monday or Wednesday.
  3. If Robert gives a report, then he cannot give it on Tuesday. Thus, he can give his report only on Monday or Wednesday.
  4. Since each day must have two reports, there will be at least one day when either Nina or Robert will give a report and the other will not give a report.
  5. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday (as per the given condition). But this is not possible as George must give his report on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give her report on Monday.
  6. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday (as per the given condition), and George must give his report on Tuesday. Thus, Robert can give his report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina can give her report on Wednesday.
  
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday. - Not possible as Nina must give her report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday. - Not possible as George must give his report on Tuesday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday. - Not possible as George must give his report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday. - Not possible as Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday. - Possible as explained above.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports.
  - Nina's report has some implications for Helen and Irving.
  - Three students will not give any reports.
  - Six reports will be given in total, no more and no less.
  - Each student can only give one report.
  - George, Nina, and Robert will give reports.
  - We need to determine which of the answer choices could be true given these conditions.
  
Analysis:
  - Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report, it must be on Monday or Tuesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, but neither of them can give a morning report since Olivia and Robert will already have given the morning reports. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.
  - Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday.
  - Since George cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday, he must give a report on Tuesday.
  - Robert cannot give a report on Tuesday since there is already one scheduled for that day, and he cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  - If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday, but there are no morning slots available since George and Nina will have already given their reports. Therefore, Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday and must give a report on Monday.
  - Helen cannot give a report on Monday since Robert will have already given a report that morning, so she must give a report on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 3 reports given each day (morning and afternoon) for 3 consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after the day Nina gave the report) Helen and Irving must both give reports, UNLESS Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - George, Nina, and Robert will give reports.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after the day Nina gave the report) Helen and Irving must both give reports, UNLESS Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Thus, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday, as that would force Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day, and we have already used up all the days. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  - Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give a report in the morning. George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give reports on Monday or Wednesday. Therefore, George must give a report on Monday. This leaves only Tuesday open for Robert, so he must give a report on Tuesday.
  - Since George and Nina have given their reports on Monday and Wednesday respectively, it means that Robert's report must be given on Tuesday morning.
  - Therefore, the only option that is possible is A, where Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - George, Nina, and Robert give reports.
  - George gives a report on Tuesday.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly six reports will be given during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  
Working through the options:
- A: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports, then George can only give his report on Tuesday, and Nina can only give her report on Monday or Wednesday. Since Helen cannot give a report on Tuesday, she must give a report on Wednesday. This satisfies the conditions, so A could be true.
- B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. George cannot give a report on Tuesday, so this is not possible. Therefore, B is not true.
- C: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Since Robert cannot give an afternoon report, he must give his report on Monday. This satisfies the conditions, so C could be true.
- D: If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then there is only one report left for Monday, which must be given by Lenore or Kyle. This violates the conditions, so D is not true.
- E: If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then there is only one report left for Wednesday, which must be given by Lenore or Kyle. This violates the conditions, so E is not true.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Six of the eight students give reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports are given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then the following must be true:
  - George must give his report on Tuesday.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must both give their reports in the morning. Therefore, if Robert gives a report, it must be on Monday.
  - If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give their reports on Tuesday, which is not allowed. Therefore, Nina's report must be on Wednesday.
  - If Nina's report is on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give their reports on the same day.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
We know that George must give his report on Tuesday, but neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. This means that Olivia and Robert must give their reports in the morning on Monday and Wednesday in some order. If Nina gives her report, then either Helen and Irving give their reports on Monday, or Nina gives her report on Wednesday. This means that:
- If Nina gives a report, then either Helen gives a report on Monday or Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
- If Robert gives a report, then Nina must give her report on Wednesday, and Helen and Irving both have to give their reports on Monday.

A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday - This cannot be true because Helen needs to give her report on Monday if Nina gives her report.
B: Nina gives a report on Monday - This cannot be true because George is the only one who can give a report on Tuesday.
C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday - This is a possible scenario because Nina can give her report on Tuesday and George and Robert can give their reports on Monday and Wednesday respectively.
D: Olivia gives a report on Monday - This cannot be true because neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday - This is a possible scenario because Robert can give his report on Wednesday and George and Nina can give their reports on Monday and Tuesday respectively.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The project will have three members, with one of them being the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can only be selected if they lead the project.
  - Smith and Taylor have to be selected together.
  - Wells and Ruiz cannot be selected together.
  
Analysis:
If one of the workers in a pair with a constraint is not selected, then the other can't be selected either. So, the possible pairs with constraints are:
- Quinn and Ruiz
- Smith and Taylor
- Ruiz and Wells
- None with Verma

A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected -> This does not determine the selection of the project because Ruiz, Taylor, Wells, and Xue can still be selected. 

B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected -> This does not determine the selection of the project because Ruiz, Smith, Wells, and Xue can still be selected. 

C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected -> This does not determine the selection of the project because Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, and Wells can still be selected.

D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected -> This determines the selection of the project because both workers are in pairs with constraints. So, if neither of them is selected, then Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue are the only ones left, and they cannot form a project team of three that includes a project leader.

E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected -> This does not determine the selection of the project because Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue can still be selected. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have 3 members, one of which will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Ruiz is not selected, then Quinn cannot be a project member because Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. So, if Ruiz is not selected, Quinn cannot be selected as the project leader. Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be selected. If Wells is not selected, then Ruiz can be the project leader, and Verma can be selected as a project member. Therefore, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Since neither Ruiz nor Wells can be selected, Smith, Taylor, and one of Verma or Quinn must be selected. If Quinn is selected, then he/she must be the project leader. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project will have 3 members and 1 project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be members if leading the project.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be a member.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members.
  
  A: Irrelevant to the constraint. The selection could still be determined if both Quinn and Smith are selected.
  B: Irrelevant to the constraint. The selection could still be determined if both Quinn and Taylor are selected.
  C: Irrelevant to the constraint. The selection could still be determined if both Quinn and Xue are selected.
  D: If Wells is not selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members. If Ruiz is not selected, then Quinn cannot be a member. Therefore, the only option left for the 3 members and 1 project leader is Smith, Taylor, and Xue, with Smith as the project leader. The selection is completely determined.
  E: If Verma is not selected, neither Ruiz nor Wells can be members. If Ruiz is not selected, then Quinn cannot be a member. Therefore, the only option left for the 3 members and 1 project leader is Smith, Taylor, and Xue, with Smith as the project leader. The selection is completely determined.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The project will have three members and one project leader.
If Quinn or Ruiz is selected then they must be the project leader, otherwise, they cannot be on the project.
If Smith is selected then Taylor must be selected as well.
If Wells is selected then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
 
A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, there are still four people to choose from. It is not enough information to determine the selection.
B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, there are still four people to choose from. It is not enough information to determine the selection.
C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the only possible project leader would be Ruiz, and the other two members would be Smith and Wells. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined.
D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, there are still four people to choose from. It is not enough information to determine the selection.
E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, it is not enough information to determine the selection.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly 3 members.
  One of the members will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they lead the project.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be a member.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members.
Action: 
  We need to find the statement that completely determines the selection.
  If we select Quinn or Ruiz, they must lead the project. That means we can only select one of them and they will be the leader. So we have two cases:
  Case 1: Quinn or Ruiz is selected. Then, only one of them is selected, and they are the leader. We still need to select two more members, but we have only 5 people left: Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue. 
    - If Smith is selected, Taylor must be selected. Then, we can only select one more member from Verma, Wells, and Xue.
    - If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. That means only one more member can be selected from Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
    - If neither Smith nor Wells are selected, we can select any two members from the remaining 4 people.
  Case 2: Neither Quinn nor Ruiz is selected. Then, we can only select 3 members from Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
    - If Smith is selected, Taylor must be selected. Then, we can only select one more member from Verma, Wells, and Xue.
    - If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. That means only one more member can be selected from Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
    - If neither Smith nor Wells are selected, we can select any three members from the remaining 3 people: Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
  The only statement that completely determines the selection is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  In order to determine the selection for the project, we need to consider each option and see if we can determine the three project members and the project leader by applying the given constraints.
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected --> It is possible that the project leader is Ruiz or Wells, and the other two members are Taylor and Verma. Or it is possible that the project leader is Quinn or Ruiz, and the other two members are Wells and Verma. Therefore, we cannot completely determine the selection for the project.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected --> In this case, the project leader cannot be Quinn or Ruiz. If the project leader is Smith, then Taylor must also be a project member. But since neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, the other two members must be Wells and Verma. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined with Wells, Verma, and Smith as the project members and Wells as the project leader.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected --> It is possible that the project leader is Ruiz or Wells, and the other two members are Smith and Taylor. Or it is possible that the project leader is Smith, and the other two members are Ruiz and Wells. Therefore, we cannot completely determine the selection for the project.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected --> In this case, the project leader must be either Quinn or Xue. Since neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, the other two members must be Smith and Taylor. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined with Smith, Taylor, and either Quinn or Xue as the project members and either Quinn or Xue as the project leader.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected --> In this case, the project leader cannot be Ruiz. If the project leader is Wells, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members. Therefore, the other two members must be Smith and Taylor. But since neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, the project leader must be Quinn. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined with Smith, Taylor, and Wells as the project members and Quinn as the project leader.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The project will have 3 members, and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

To determine the answer, we can eliminate options that do not give enough information to determine the project members. 

Option A: We don't know anything about Quinn and Smith's eligibility, so we cannot completely determine the project members. Eliminate.

Option B: We don't know anything about Quinn and Taylor's eligibility, so we cannot completely determine the project members. Eliminate.

Option C: We don't know anything about Quinn and Xue's eligibility, so we cannot completely determine the project members. Eliminate.

Option D: If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. If we select Wells, we cannot select Ruiz or Verma, and we have only one spot remaining. Because Quinn and Ruiz can only be selected as project members if they are also the leader, we can eliminate Quinn and Ruiz as possibilities. We are left with Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue as potential members, and one of them will be the leader. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected. 

Option E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we still have 5 potential members to choose from: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue. We cannot completely determine the project members. Eliminate.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of the project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Ruiz is not selected, then Quinn cannot be selected either as per the given condition. Also, if Wells is not selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. This means, the only possible combination is Smith, Taylor and either Wells or Verma. Since exactly one of the project members will be the project leader, the leader will be either Smith or Taylor. Therefore, the selection is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have a team of 3 members, with 1 leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, he/she must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  
Analysis:
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, it is still possible to have 3 members and a leader among the remaining 5 candidates. Therefore, this choice cannot completely determine the selection.
  B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, it is still possible to have 3 members and a leader among the remaining 5 candidates. Therefore, this choice cannot completely determine the selection.
  C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, it is still possible to have 3 members and a leader among the remaining 5 candidates. Therefore, this choice cannot completely determine the selection.
  D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, it is impossible to have a team with a leader because either Ruiz or Wells must be the leader if they are selected. Therefore, if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, the team cannot be completely determined.
  E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, it is still possible to have 3 members and a leader among the remaining 5 candidates. Therefore, this choice cannot completely determine the selection.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly 3 members.
  The project will have only 1 leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  We will need to go through each option and see which one would fix the selection completely.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey, because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Udall must work in Zone 2 because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3. However, there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 1, then there would be three sales representatives in Zone 1, which would mean there would be four sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, it must be the case that Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3. This means that Parra and Quinn also work in Zone 3 since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Finally, Tiao works in Zone 1 since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
- If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, it means that they cannot be in Zone 1 or Zone 2, because the representatives in those zones are already determined by the given conditions.
- Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey must be in Zone 3.
- Also, since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it means that at least 3 representatives are in Zone 3.
- We know that Parra is either in Zone 1 or Zone 3, and Tiao is either in Zone 1 or Zone 2. Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao can be in Zone 3 with Mahr and Stuckey.
- From the remaining representatives (Kim, Quinn, and Udall), we know that Quinn cannot be in Zone 3 because she is in the same zone as Parra. Therefore, Quinn is either in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
- If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Kim must be in Zone 2 (since the representatives in Zones 1 and 3 are already determined). This contradicts the fact that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Therefore, Quinn must be in Zone 2, and Kim must be in Zone 1.
- This leaves only one representative (either Parra or Tiao) to be in Zone 3. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it means that Parra must be in Zone 3.
- This leaves Udall to be in Zone 1.

Answer: Answer("D") Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that sales zone because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  Therefore, there are at most 2 sales representatives in the other 2 zones, so more of the sales representatives are working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  This means that both Parra and Tiao work in Zone 3, making choice E incorrect.
  Since Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, making choice A incorrect.
  Since Parra works in Zone 3 and Mahr and Udall work in the same sales zone, the only possibility is that Mahr works in Zone 2 and Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey and Mahr, making choice B incorrect.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that Stuckey works in Zone 2, making choice D the correct answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The seven sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2, which means that Parra must work in Zone 1. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Kim, Mahr, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall must work in Zone 3. This means that the only option that could be true is:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives to work in its three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must work in the same sales zone as well, since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. In this case, there will be at most one sales representative in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and since there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Parra, Quinn, Kim, and Tiao must work in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 3. This eliminates choices A, B, and E. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The software company has seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
- The sales representatives work in one of three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
- There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

A: There is no information given about whether Kim works in Zone 2 or not.
B: There is no information given about whether Mahr works in Zone 1 or not.
C: There is no information given about whether Parra works in Zone 3 or not.
D: We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, but we do not know whether that zone is Zone 2.
E: There is no information given about whether Tiao works in Zone 1 or not.

If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Parra and Quinn must also work in that zone, since they each work in the same zone as one of Mahr or Stuckey. This means that there are at least three sales representatives in that zone (Mahr, Stuckey, Parra/Quinn). Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and we know that at least two sales representatives (Tiao and Udall) work in Zone 2, it follows that at least three sales representatives (including Mahr and Stuckey) must work in Zone 3. Therefore, the only option that could be true is:
Action: Answer("C") Parra works in Zone 3.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must work in the same sales zone as well. Then, since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall all work in Zone 3. This means that Parra and Quinn must also work in Zone 3 since they both work in the same sales zone. This leaves Kim and Tiao to work in Zone 1 and Zone 2.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then either Mahr and Udall work in Zone 2 or Tiao and Quinn work in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then either Mahr and Udall work in Zone 2 or Tiao and Quinn work in Zone 2.
  - A: Kim works in Zone 2. We don't know where Kim works, so this could be possible.
  - B: Mahr works in Zone 1. If Mahr works in Zone 1, then Mahr and Parra or Mahr and Tiao must work in the same zone, which is not possible based on the given conditions.
  - C: Parra works in Zone 3. If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1 and Udall must work in Zone 2. This would mean that Mahr and Stuckey are both in Zone 2, which is possible based on the given conditions.
  - D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. If Stuckey works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 2. This would mean that Mahr and Udall are both in Zone 2, which is possible based on the given conditions.
  - E: Tiao works in Zone 1. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3 and Udall must work in Zone 2. This would mean that Mahr and Stuckey are both in Zone 2, which is possible based on the given conditions.

Action: Answer("C") or Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The seven sales representatives are Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - The three sales zones are Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Stuckey and Udall must work in the same sales zone as well, according to the given conditions. Therefore, they cannot be in Zone 2, since Tiao or Udall will work in that zone but not both. Hence, Mahr and Stuckey must be in Zone 1 or Zone 3. However, since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it is likely that Mahr and Stuckey are both in Zone 3. Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn work in Zone 2. This means that Kim cannot work in Zone 2, as there are already two sales representatives there, so Kim must work in Zone 3. Therefore, the following statement could be true: Stuckey works in Zone 3. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they are both in the same zone as Udall.
  
  A: There is no information about Kim's sales zone, so it could be any of the three zones. This choice is not related to Mahr and Stuckey working in the same sales zone.
  B: If Mahr works in Zone 1, then Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1, but this would violate the condition that only one of them works in Zone 1. This choice cannot be true.
  C: If Parra works in Zone 3, then there must be at least two representatives working in Zone 3 (because there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2), but this would violate the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and that Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. This choice cannot be true.
  D: If Stuckey works in Zone 2, then Udall must also work in Zone 2 (because they work in the same sales zone), but this would violate the condition that Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. This choice cannot be true.
  E: If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3 (because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2), and Udall must work in Zone 2 (because Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2). This leaves Mahr and Stuckey to work in Zone 3, which is possible because there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, this choice could be true.

The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Analysis:
We know that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Also, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, there are only two possible arrangements for the restaurants – restaurant, x, x, x, restaurant or x, x, restaurant, x, x, restaurant. 

The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so we can place them next to each other at one end and the pharmacy at the other end. 

Finally, we know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so we can eliminate option A and B because the toy store is next to the veterinarian.

Option C violates the rule that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. 

Option D violates the rule that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each chapter is assigned exactly one clue.
  - The order of clues is subject to several constraints:
    - T cannot be in chapter 1.
    - T must be before W, with exactly 2 chapters in between.
    - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  - X is mentioned in chapter 1.
  
Action: 
  We can use the constraints to eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - Since X is mentioned in chapter 1, U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, X and U must be mentioned in chapters 1 and 2, in some order.
  - Since W cannot be in an adjacent chapter to X, W cannot be in chapter 2.
  - Since T cannot be in chapter 1, and T must be before W with exactly 2 chapters in between, T and W must be in chapters 4 and 7, in some order.
  - Since S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, neither S nor Z can be in chapter 2.
  
  Therefore, the only remaining answer choice that fits the constraints is:
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  
  Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Solution:
If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. According to the constraints, T is not mentioned in chapter 1 and it has to be mentioned before W with exactly two chapters separating them. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and W in chapter 5. Also, according to the constraints, S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, which leaves only R and Z as possible clues for chapter 2. Since Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, it follows that Z is mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 3 and S in chapter 4. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each clue must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  There are seven chapters, numbered 1 through 7.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and it must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1 and U is mentioned in chapter 2, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, it must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later. T must be mentioned before W, so T must be mentioned in chapter 4. This leaves R and S to be mentioned in chapters 3 and 6, but S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 3 and S must be mentioned in chapter 6. Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4 because it would be adjacent to either S or T. Therefore, Z must be mentioned in chapter 7. Thus, the only choice that could be true is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each chapter has exactly one clue, and each clue is used exactly once.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1, but we don't know where it is otherwise.
  - T must be before W, with exactly two chapters in between.
  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  
  If X is in chapter 1:
  - U must be in chapter 2.
  - W must be in chapter 5.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1, so it must be in chapter 3 or later.
  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, so neither can be in chapter 2 or 3.
  
  A: R cannot be in chapter 3 because T must be there, and T cannot be in chapter 1.
  B: R cannot be in chapter 7 because W must be there, and W cannot be in chapter 7.
  C: S cannot be in chapter 2 because Z cannot be in chapter 3.
  D: W must be in chapter 5, so this is possible.
  E: Z cannot be in chapter 3 because S cannot be in chapter 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each of these clues is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to certain constraints.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Solution:
If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. According to the constraint, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5. Also, T must be mentioned before W with exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and W must be mentioned in chapter 5. So the order of the clues mentioned in the chapters 1 through 7 must be X-U-T-S-R-Z-W.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. Incorrect. R must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6.
B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. Incorrect. R must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6.
C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. Incorrect. T must be mentioned in chapter 2.
D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. Correct. 
E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. Incorrect. Z must be mentioned in chapter 6.

Therefore, the answer is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once from chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, because it must be after T and with two chapters separating T and W.
  - Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  - Since W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters with W, X must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then R, S, T, and Z are the remaining clues that can be mentioned.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because X and U must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Therefore, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, then R must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are seven clues, R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z, and each clue is mentioned exactly once.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, the possible locations for U are limited to chapter 2 or chapter 7.
  
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 7. Therefore, the possible locations for W are chapter 5 or chapter 6. If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, the possible answers are:
  A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. This option is not possible.
  B: If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, which is possible. This option is possible.
  C: If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 and W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. This option is not possible.
  D: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, which is possible. This option is possible.
  E: If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 4 and T must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. This option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The mystery novel has seven chapters.
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  T cannot be in Chapter 1.
  T must be before W and with two chapters in between.
  S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If X is in chapter 1, then U must be in chapter 2.
  W cannot be in chapter 2, so W must be in chapter 5.
  T must be before W with two chapters in between, so T must be in chapter 3.
  S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be in chapter 2 and Z cannot be in chapter 4.
  Therefore, R must be in chapter 7.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z) and seven chapters (chapter 1 through chapter 7).
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
  - U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because X and W cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  - Since U and X must be in adjacent chapters, then U and X must be in chapters 2 and 3 (in some order).
  - Since T must be mentioned before W, then T must be in chapter 3 and W must be in chapter 6.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be in chapters 1, 2, or 3.
  
Answer: 
  The only choice that could be true is D because W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and it cannot be in chapter 2 since X is mentioned there. Hence, Answer("D").
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  X is mentioned in Chapter 1.
  T cannot be mentioned in Chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W.
  There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If X is mentioned in Chapter 1, then W cannot be in Chapter 2 since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. There must be two chapters separating T and W. Therefore, T must be in Chapter 3 or Chapter 4, and W must be in Chapter 5 or Chapter 6. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, if W is in Chapter 5, then Z must be in Chapter 7 and S must be in Chapter 2 or Chapter 4. If W is in Chapter 6, then S must be in Chapter 2 and Z must be in Chapter 7.
  
  A: R is mentioned in Chapter 3, but T must be mentioned before W, which means T would need to be in Chapter 2 if R is in Chapter 3. This violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in Chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in Chapter 7. This is possible, but we cannot determine the location of any of the other clues with certainty.
  C: S is mentioned in Chapter 2. This is possible if W is in Chapter 5.
  D: W is mentioned in Chapter 5. This is possible if S is in Chapter 4 and Z is in Chapter 7.
  E: Z is mentioned in Chapter 3. This is not possible since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - 6 photographs total, 2 each in 3 different sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports)
  - 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue
  - Each photographer can have between 1 and 3 photographs in total
  - At least one photographer must have a photo in both Lifestyle and Metro sections
  - The number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle = number of Fuentes' photos in Sports
  - Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section
  
Action: 
  If both photographs in one section are by Gagnon, then the only section that Gagnon's photos can appear in is the Metro section. Therefore, we know that at least one of the Lifestyle section photos was taken by either Fuentes or Hue. Since there must be at least one photographer with photos in both Lifestyle and Metro, we know that either Fuentes or Hue took a photo in the Metro section. 
  - A: It is not possible for both Lifestyle photos to be by Hue if Gagnon has both Metro photos.
  - B: One photo each by Fuentes and Hue in the Lifestyle section is possible.
  - C: It is not possible for both Metro photos to be by Fuentes if Gagnon has both Metro photos.
  - D: One photo each by Gagnon and Hue in the Metro section is possible.
  - E: It is not possible for both Sports photos to be by Hue if Gagnon has both Metro photos.
  
Therefore, the answer is B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a scenario that satisfies all the conditions given in the context.
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) should have exactly two photographs.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Analysis:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the number of Gagnon's photographs in the Metro and Lifestyle sections must be either one or two.
  If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then we violate the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then we violate the condition that there should be no more than three photographs of each photographer in a section.
  If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then we violate the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the only possible scenario is that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, and one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Fuentes.
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are 6 photographs in total, 2 photos per section in 3 sections.
  - Each photographer must have at least 1 but no more than 3 photos in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

We know that if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the Sports section must have photographs by Fuentes and Hue. According to the constraint, the Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since the Sports section has no photographs by Gagnon, Gagnon must have both photographs in the Metro section. To satisfy the constraint that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, Fuentes must have both photographs in the Sports section. Finally, Hue must have both photographs in the Lifestyle section. 

Action: Answer("A") - Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - 6 photographs are to appear in 3 sections (2 photographs per section).
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of their photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then:
- Gagnon has 2 photographs in one section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
- Therefore, Gagnon's photographs must be in the Lifestyle or Metro section.
- Let's consider each option:
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. - This would violate the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Incorrect.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. - This could be true. If Gagnon's 2 photographs are in the Metro section, then this option is possible. 
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. - This would violate the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Incorrect.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. - This would violate the condition that Gagnon has 2 photographs in one section. Incorrect.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - This could be true. If Gagnon's 2 photographs are in the Lifestyle section, then this option is possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon's photographs cannot be in the Sports section. Therefore, they must be in either the Lifestyle or Metro section.
  
  A: If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, that means that there are no Gagnon photographs in the Lifestyle section, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, A is not true.
  
  B: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there must be at least one Gagnon photograph in the Metro section to satisfy the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, B is possible.
  
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes because that would mean there are no Gagnon photographs in the Metro section, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, C is not true.
  
  D: If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then both photographs in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes to satisfy the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, D is possible.
  
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue because that would mean there are no Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, E is not true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Each section must have exactly two photographs.
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one photograph in Lifestyle must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in Sports.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
If both photographs in one of the sections are by Gagnon, then the only section that Gagnon can be in is Metro. Therefore, it is possible that one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, and one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This satisfies the conditions of the problem. Thus, the answer is (D).
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers - Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue
  - There are three sections - Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports
  - A total of six photographs will appear, with two photographs in each section
  - Each photographer must have at least one photograph, but no more than three photographs, in total
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the photographs in the other two sections must contain at least one photograph by each of Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. This means that the photograph in the Lifestyle section that is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon. Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section must be either by Fuentes or Hue. This leaves two possible scenarios:
- Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, and one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes and the other photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. This means that one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes and the other photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. This scenario satisfies all of the constraints.
- One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue. This means that one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and the other photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. This means that one photograph in the Sports section is by Gagnon and the other photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. This scenario satisfies all of the constraints. 
Therefore, (B) One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue could be true.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section should have exactly 2 photographs.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be at least 1 and at most 3. Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, then Hue must have at least 1 photograph in the Lifestyle section as well.

A: It is impossible for both photographs in the Lifestyle section to be by Hue, since there must be at least one photographer who has at least one photograph in both the Lifestyle and Metro sections.
B: This is possible, since Fuentes can have 1 photograph in the Sports section and 1 photograph in the Lifestyle section, while Hue can have 1 photograph in the Lifestyle section and 1 photograph in the Metro section.
C: It is impossible for both photographs in the Metro section to be by Fuentes, since each photographer can have at most 3 photographs in total.
D: This is possible, since Gagnon can have 2 photographs in one of the sections (let's say Metro), and Hue can have 1 photograph in the Metro section and 1 photograph in the Lifestyle section.
E: It is impossible for both photographs in the Sports section to be by Hue, since Hue must have at least 1 photograph in the Lifestyle section.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs will appear in three different sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Each section will have exactly two photographs.
  - There are three different photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer can have at least one, but no more than three photographs in total.
  - There are some constraints on the selection of photographs, including:
    - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
    - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
    - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("E") 

If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then the only option that could be true is E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, and all three photographers must have at least one photograph in each section, Hue must have both photographs in the Sports section. This means that Fuentes must have both photographs in the Lifestyle section, and since one of those photographs must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, Hue must also have at least one photograph in the Metro section. This leaves only one photograph by Hue available for the Lifestyle section, so the other photograph in that section must be by Gagnon. Finally, this means that both photographs in the Metro section must be by Fuentes.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  There are six different photographs, exactly two photographs per section.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Solution: 
- If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot appear in the Sports section. Therefore, the two Gagnon photographs must appear in either the Lifestyle or Metro section.
- Because there are only two photographs per section, Gagnon cannot have more than two photographs in any section.
- There are only two photographers left for the other section that contains a Gagnon photograph. They are Fuentes and Hue.
- If Gagnon has two photographs in the Lifestyle section, then neither Fuentes nor Hue can have more than one photograph in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, the third photographer must have one photograph in the Lifestyle section, and it must be either Fuentes or Hue. 
- If Gagnon has two photographs in the Metro section, then neither Fuentes nor Hue can have more than one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, the third photographer must have one photograph in the Metro section, and it must be either Fuentes or Hue.
- If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then there would be no photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, which violates the constraint.
- If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then there would be no photograph in the Sports section by Fuentes, which violates the constraint.
- Therefore, the only possible option is B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are six antiques to be auctioned: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and also before the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
- From the rules, we can deduce that the sundial is auctioned on either June 2nd or June 3rd.
- Since the table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both, it means the table must be auctioned on either June 1st or June 2nd.
- If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica and the vase will be auctioned on June 2nd and June 3rd, respectively. This leaves the lamp, mirror, and sundial to be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, and June 6th, respectively. However, this violates the rule that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and also before the vase.
- If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the vase will be auctioned on June 1st and June 3rd, respectively. This leaves the lamp, mirror, and sundial to be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, and June 6th, respectively. This satisfies all the given rules.

Action: Answer("B") - The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Six antiques are auctioned on six consecutive days, starting from June 1st.
  - The antiques are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica is auctioned on a date later than the lamp OR the harmonica is auctioned on the same day as the vase.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on a date earlier than the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica OR the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: 
  - June 1st: either table or vase is auctioned. Harmonica and lamp can't be auctioned on the first day.
  - June 2nd: either harmonica or lamp is auctioned. But the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd. 
  - June 3rd: either table or vase is auctioned. The lamp can't be auctioned on June 3rd because the harmonica is auctioned earlier.
  - June 4th: either harmonica or lamp is auctioned. The vase can't be auctioned on June 4th because it would be later than the mirror.
  - June 5th: either mirror or table is auctioned. The harmonica can't be auctioned on June 5th because it would be later than the lamp.
  - June 6th: the remaining antique is auctioned, which is either the lamp or the harmonica.
  
  From the above analysis, we can see that the lamp could be auctioned on June 2nd. 
  Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st
  - If harmonica is auctioned before lamp, then mirror is also before lamp.
  - Sundial is before mirror and vase
  - Table is before harmonica or vase, but not both.

Analysis:
  - Sundial cannot be on June 1st. Therefore, it must be on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th or June 6th.
  - If harmonica is before lamp, then mirror must also be before lamp. So, there are two possible scenarios: harmonica-lamp-mirror or lamp-harmonica-mirror.
  - If Sundial is before mirror and vase, then the order of the remaining antiques must be: Table-Sundial-Mirror-Vase-Harmonica-Lamp or Table-Sundial-Mirror-Vase-Lamp-Harmonica.
  - Table must be before either Harmonica or Vase, but not both.

Action: Answer("D") 

Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If harmonica is auctioned earlier than lamp, then mirror is also auctioned earlier than lamp.
  - Sundial is auctioned earlier than mirror and vase.
  - Table is auctioned earlier than harmonica or vase, but not both.
  - There are six antiques to be auctioned, one per day, from June 1st to June 6th.
  
Analysis:
  - From the third condition, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on one of the other dates.
  - From the first and third conditions, we know that the sundial must be auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase.
  - From the fourth condition, we know that the table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or the vase, but not both. This means that there are only two possible orders for the auction dates of the table, harmonica, and vase:
      - (1) Table, Harmonica, Vase
      - (2) Table, Vase, Harmonica
  - We can use the second condition to determine the possible orders for the lamp and the mirror.
      - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
      - This means that the order of the lamp and mirror must be one of the following:
          - (1) Harmonica, Mirror, Lamp
          - (2) Mirror, Harmonica, Lamp
          - (3) Mirror, Lamp, Harmonica
  - We can now use these two sets of possible orders to determine which of the answer choices could be true.
      - A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
          - This is possible if the order is (2) Mirror, Harmonica, Lamp, followed by Sundial, Table, and Vase.
      - B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
          - This is not possible, because if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and mirror must be auctioned earlier, and the only possible order for those two antiques is (2) Mirror, Harmonica, Lamp. However, if the mirror is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica and lamp cannot be auctioned on earlier dates, so this is not possible.
      - C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
          - This is not possible, because the vase must be auctioned after the sundial and the table, which leaves only June 3rd, 4th, or 5th as possible dates for the vase.
      - D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
          - This is possible if the order is (1) Table, Harmonica, Vase, followed by Sundial, Mirror, and Lamp.
      - E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
          - This is not possible, because the only possible order for the harmonica, mirror, and lamp is (3) Mirror, Lamp, Harmonica, and if the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp and harmonica must be auctioned earlier, which is not possible with this order.
          
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The auction runs for six consecutive days, from June 1st through June 6th.
  - The following antiques will be auctioned: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and also before the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
Action: 
  We can start by eliminating certain options:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so options A, B, and C cannot be true.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, so the harmonica and the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd. This eliminates option C.
  - The lamp cannot be auctioned before the harmonica, so option B cannot be true.
  
  This leaves us with two options: D and E.
  - If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date, which means that the mirror must also be auctioned on an earlier date. The only antiques left to auction on June 1st are the sundial, the table, and the vase. The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so either the table or the vase must be auctioned on June 1st. This means that the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st. This leaves the mirror to be auctioned on June 4th, and the harmonica to be auctioned on June 3rd. Therefore, option D could be true.
  - If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date, which means that the lamp must be auctioned on a later date. The only antiques left to auction on June 1st are the sundial, the table, and the vase. The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so either the table or the vase must be auctioned on June 1st. This means that the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st. This leaves the lamp to be auctioned on June 6th, and the harmonica to be auctioned on June 3rd. Therefore, option E could be true.
  
  Since both options D and E could be true, we cannot definitively choose one over the other. Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The harmonica and the lamp have a particular relationship with the mirror.
  The sundial has a particular relationship with the mirror and the vase.
  The table has a particular relationship with the harmonica and the vase.
  
Analysis:
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  This means the harmonica and the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because we cannot decide which one is auctioned earlier.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror and the vase cannot be auctioned on that day.
  If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the vase cannot be auctioned on that day.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd and the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd. This satisfies all the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Six antiques are auctioned, one a day, from June 1st to June 6th.
- The antiques are: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
- The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
- The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
- If the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, then it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
- If the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both, then it can be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
- If the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, then it cannot be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp and the mirror is auctioned before the lamp, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
- If the vase is auctioned after the sundial, then the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The lamp can only be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, and it cannot be auctioned on June 3rd because the table would have to be auctioned before it. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The auction runs for 6 consecutive days, from June 1st through June 6th.
  - The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
  - Since the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - Since the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both, it cannot be auctioned on June 6th. If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 6th, but this is not possible since the sundial must be auctioned before the vase. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd, but this is not possible since the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st and June 6th, but this is not possible since the sundial must be auctioned before the vase. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st and June 6th, and the sundial, the mirror, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 4th, and June 5th, but it is not clear which antique is auctioned on which date.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st and June 6th, and the sundial, the mirror, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, and June 5th, but it is not clear which antique is auctioned on which date.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Action: 
  Option A contradicts the rule that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Eliminate A.
  Option B contradicts the rule that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Eliminate B.
  Option C contradicts the rule that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Eliminate C.
  Option D satisfies all the conditions. The lamp is not the first item to be auctioned because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp because the harmonica cannot be auctioned before the lamp. The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and before the vase. The table can be auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or the vase, but not both, so it could be auctioned on June 1st, which is not precluded by any of the given conditions. Keep D.
  Option E contradicts the rule that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Eliminate E.
Answer: Answer("D")

- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- The harmonica must be auctioned after the lamp for the mirror to be auctioned before the lamp.
- The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
- The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. 
- If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd since the harmonica cannot be auctioned before the lamp.
- The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror, so the sundial can only be auctioned on June 1st.
- The table must be auctioned before the harmonica, but not the vase. Therefore, the table could be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
- The remaining two antiques are the harmonica and the vase. However, we cannot determine their order.
- Therefore, it is possible that the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, and this option could be true.

B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
- If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st.
- The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror, so the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
- The table must be auctioned before the harmonica, but not the vase. Therefore, the table could be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
- The remaining two antiques are the sundial and the vase. However, we cannot determine their order.
- Therefore, it is not possible that the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.

C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
- If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st.
- The sundial must be auctioned before the vase, so the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
- The table must be auctioned before the vase, but not the harmonica. Therefore, the table could be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
- The remaining two antiques are the lamp and the sundial. However, we cannot determine their order.
- Therefore, it is not possible that the vase is auctioned on June 2nd.

D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
- If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which means the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
- The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror, so the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
- The table must be auctioned before the harmonica, but not the vase. Therefore, the table could be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
- The remaining two antiques are the vase and the sundial. However, we cannot determine their order.
- Therefore, it is not possible that the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.

E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
- If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th since the harmonica cannot be auctioned before the lamp.
- The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror, so the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 5th.
- The table must be auctioned before the harmonica, but not the vase. Therefore, the table could be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
- The remaining two antiques are the harmonica and the vase. However, we cannot determine their order.
- Therefore, it is not possible that the mirror is auctioned on June 5th.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.

  If a building is class 3, it can only be traded for another class 3 building or a class 2 building.
 
A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of these buildings.
B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. This could be true. Southco owns the Garza Tower and Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building, so these two buildings could be traded.
C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This cannot be true because Southco only owns two buildings. 
D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. This could be true. Trustcorp owns the Flores Tower and RealProp owns the Yates House, so these two buildings could be traded.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The photography business manager must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies, one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. 
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Analysis:
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies, so they cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony alone.
  Gonzalez must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony because if he is assigned there, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, which means they cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, which means Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
 
Action: Answer("B")  
The only possible complete assignment for the photographers to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Elimination:
  We know that at least two photographers must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. 
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so they cannot be assigned separately. 
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. 

A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson - This can't be the answer because it doesn't include at least two photographers for Thorne University ceremony.
B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck - This could be the answer as it includes at least two photographers for Thorne University ceremony.
C: Gonzalez, Knutson - This can't be the answer because it only includes two photographers and we need at least two photographers for Thorne University ceremony.
D: Heideck, Lai - This can't be the answer because it only includes two photographers and we need at least two photographers for Silva University ceremony.
E: Knutson, Mays - This can't be the answer because it only includes two photographers and we need at least two photographers for Silva University ceremony.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University.
  - Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  - No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  - If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so both must be assigned to either Silva or Thorne.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Otherwise, if Lai is assigned to Silva, then Gonzalez must be assigned to Thorne.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Solution:
  - We know that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony, so A, C, and E can be ruled out since they don't include both Frost and Heideck.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, Lai must be assigned to Thorne. So, we need to check whether the remaining photographers can be assigned to Thorne or not. If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. So, we can assign Heideck and Mays to Thorne along with Gonzalez, which leaves us with Lai and Frost for Silva.
  - Therefore, the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony could be Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The manager must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Analysis:
  Since the Silva University ceremony must have at least two photographers, Frost and Heideck must both be assigned to this ceremony. 
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. Therefore, either Lai or Mays can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Elimination:
- Choices C, D, and E are incorrect because they do not include enough photographers.
- Choice A is incorrect because it includes Knutson who cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
- Choice B includes Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck who must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies, but it does not violate any of the given constraints.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find the possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony. So, the combination of Frost and Heideck can only be assigned to Silva University ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. So, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. So, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. So, Lai and Mays cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony together.
  
Solution:
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Lai and Mays cannot be assigned together to the Silva University ceremony.
  So, the only possible assignment to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Heideck. Therefore, the answer is A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The manager of the photography business must assign at least two photographers to each ceremony.
  Exactly six photographers are available.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  We need to find a complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony that satisfies all the constraints.
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, so any assignment to Silva University must include both of them.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne University, so Lai and Mays cannot both be assigned to the same ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so Knutson must be assigned to Thorne University.

Solution: 
  The complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony that satisfies all the constraints is Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, and Knutson.
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson - Frost and Heideck are assigned together, but we need at least two photographers assigned to Thorne University.
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck - Frost and Heideck are assigned together, but we need at least two photographers assigned to Thorne University.
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson - We need at least two photographers assigned to Silva University.
  D: Heideck, Lai - We need at least two photographers assigned to Silva University and Lai must be assigned to Thorne University if Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University.
  E: Knutson, Mays - We need at least two photographers assigned to Silva University and if Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The manager must assign at least two photographers to each of the two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, they must be assigned to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  We need to find a valid assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We know that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies.
  Also, if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices C, D, and E because they do not include Gonzalez or Lai.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, we can eliminate choice A, which does not include Mays.
  Choice B includes Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck, which satisfies the first constraint. It also satisfies the constraint that no photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. Therefore, it is a valid assignment.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:

  The manager must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
  A: Frost and Heideck have to be assigned together, and at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony, so this is not possible because only four photographers are assigned.
  B: Frost and Heideck have to be assigned together. If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne. We can assign Knutson and Mays to Thorne. Therefore, this is possible.
  C: If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. This means that Lai and Gonzalez must be assigned to Silva, but at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony, so this is not possible because only two photographers are assigned.
  D: Frost and Heideck have to be assigned together. There must be at least two photographers assigned to each ceremony. Lai and Mays can't be assigned to the same ceremony. Therefore, this is not possible because only two photographers are assigned.
  E: If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. This means that Gonzalez and Lai must be assigned to Silva, but at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony, so this is not possible because only two photographers are assigned.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth.
  We know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  We know that Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  We know that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton was not recruited second.
  If Tao was recruited second, then there are only two possible positions for Tao: second or seventh (last).
  If Tao was recruited second, then Villas was not recruited second.
  If Tao was recruited second, then White was not recruited seventh.
  If Tao was recruited second, then there are only two possible positions for Quinn: third or seventh (last).
  If Tao was recruited second, then there are only two possible positions for Rovero: fifth or sixth.
  
Analysis:
  We are looking for a statement that could be true if Tao was recruited second.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first. Thus, Peters cannot be recruited after Quinn, Rovero, or Stanton.
  If Tao was recruited second, then there are only two possible positions for Quinn: third or seventh (last). Thus, Quinn could have been recruited third.
  If Tao was recruited second, then there are only two possible positions for Rovero: fifth or sixth. Thus, Rovero could have been recruited fifth.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Villas was not recruited second. Thus, Villas could have been recruited sixth.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton was not recruited second. Thus, Stanton could not have been recruited sixth.
  If Tao was recruited second, then there are only two possible positions for White: fourth or seventh (last). Thus, White could not have been recruited third.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The statement "Quinn was recruited third" could be true if Tao was recruited second.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Process of elimination:
  - If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited fourth, then there are only two possible positions for Tao's other recruits: either they were recruited before Peters (positions 1 and 3) or after Peters (positions 5, 6, and 7).
  - Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, Quinn must have been recruited in position 1 or 2, and Rovero must have been recruited in position 5, 6, or 7.
  - Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, Villas must have been recruited in position 5 or 6, and White must have been recruited in position 6 or 7.
  - Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, Stanton must have been recruited in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  
Analysis:
  - If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero would have to be recruited in position 5, which is not possible since Villas was recruited in position 5 or 6 and immediately before White.
  - If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Quinn must have been recruited in position 2, which is not possible since Peters was recruited in position 4.
  - If Stanton was recruited sixth, then there would be no possible position for Rovero, since Villas was recruited in position 5 or 6 and immediately before White.
  - If Villas was recruited sixth, then White would have to be recruited in position 7, which is not possible since there are only seven positions and Peters was recruited in position 4.
  - Therefore, the only possibility is that White was recruited third.
  
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 7 accomplices: Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  2. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  3. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  4. Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  5. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  6. Peters was recruited fourth.
  
If Tao was recruited second, then the recruitment order is: 1, Tao, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

Analysis:
- Option A: If Tao was recruited second, Quinn cannot be recruited third, because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero (2nd clue). Therefore, A is not possible.
- Option B: If Tao was recruited second, Rovero cannot be recruited fifth because Peters was recruited fourth, and the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time (3rd clue). Therefore, B is not possible.
- Option C: If Tao was recruited second, Stanton cannot be recruited sixth because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao (4th clue). Therefore, C is not possible.
- Option D: If Tao was recruited second, Villas cannot be recruited sixth because Villas was recruited immediately before White (5th clue). Therefore, D is not possible.
- Option E: If Tao was recruited second, then the recruitment order is: 1, Tao, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. White could be recruited third. Therefore, E is possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  - If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited first.
  - According to the given information, Peters was recruited fourth, so this is impossible.
  - Therefore, Tao was not recruited second.
  - If Quinn was recruited second, then the order would be Peters, Quinn, Tao, and the remaining order would be Villas, White, Rovero, and Stanton.
  - This satisfies all the given conditions, so Quinn was recruited second.
  - If Quinn was recruited second, then Rovero could not have been recruited fifth, as Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then White could not have been recruited third, as Quinn was already recruited second.
  - If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Tao would have to be recruited either immediately before or immediately after Stanton, which is not possible according to the given information.
  - Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Tao was recruited second.
  
  A: If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn must have been recruited first, so it is possible that Quinn was recruited third.
  B: If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn was recruited first, Peters was recruited fourth, and Tao was recruited second, leaving Rovero to be recruited fifth.
  C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then there would be no one left to be recruited seventh after White.
  D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then White would have to be recruited seventh, which is not possible since there are only seven people and Peters was recruited fourth.
  E: If White was recruited third, then Peters would have to be recruited fourth, and Tao would have to be recruited fifth, leaving only Quinn, Rovero, and Stanton to be recruited in some order as the last three. This is possible since we know that Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  We know that the criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time: Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  We know that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order in which the remaining accomplices could have been recruited is as follows:
  1. Peters
  2. Tao
  3. Quinn (because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero)
  4. Villas (because Villas was recruited immediately before White)
  5. White (because Villas was recruited immediately before White)
  6. Stanton and 7. Rovero (because Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao)
  
Action: Answer("D")  
  If Tao was recruited second, then Villas could have been recruited sixth.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.

- If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited third.
- Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn was recruited first and Rovero was recruited sixth.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas was recruited fifth and White was recruited seventh.
- Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton was recruited either fourth or sixth.

A: Quinn was recruited third. Possible.
B: Rovero was recruited fifth. Not possible.
C: Stanton was recruited sixth. Possible.
D: Villas was recruited sixth. Not possible.
E: White was recruited third. Not possible.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited third. So, we have the following order so far: __ Tao Peters __ __ __ __ __.
We know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited either first or second. If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero must have been recruited third or later. This would mean that Peters was recruited earlier than Rovero, which contradicts what we know. Therefore, Quinn must have been recruited second, and we now have the following order: Quinn Tao Peters __ __ __ __.

A: If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero must have been recruited fourth or later. This would mean that Peters was recruited earlier than Rovero, which contradicts what we know. So, this cannot be true.
B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Stanton must have been recruited fourth or earlier. This would mean that Stanton was recruited immediately before or after Tao, which contradicts what we know. So, this cannot be true.
C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Villas must have been recruited fifth and White must have been recruited seventh. However, this would mean that Peters was recruited earlier than Rovero, which contradicts what we know. So, this cannot be true.
D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then White must have been recruited seventh. However, this would mean that Peters was recruited earlier than Rovero, which contradicts what we know. So, this cannot be true.
E: If White was recruited third, then Villas must have been recruited second. However, this would mean that Peters was recruited earlier than Rovero, which contradicts what we know. So, this cannot be true.

Therefore, the only option that could be true is A: Quinn was recruited third. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth
  - There are seven accomplices in total.
  - Tao was recruited second.
  
Using the given information, we can deduce the following timeline of recruitment:
1. Unknown
2. Tao
3. Unknown
4. Peters
5. Unknown
6. Villas
7. White

Option A: If Quinn was recruited third, then Stanton must be recruited fifth. This violates the given information that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, this option is not true.

Option B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Quinn must be recruited third and Stanton must be recruited sixth. This timeline would satisfy all the given information. Therefore, this option could be true.

Option C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Quinn must be recruited third and Rovero must be recruited fifth. This violates the given information that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, this option is not true.

Option D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then White must be recruited seventh. This violates the given information that Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, this option is not true.

Option E: If White was recruited third, then Quinn must be recruited second which violates the given information that Tao was recruited second. Therefore, this option is not true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1) Tao was recruited second.
  2) Peters was recruited fourth.
  3) Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  4) Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  5) Villas was recruited immediately before White.

Analysis:
  Based on the given information, we can conclude that:
  1) Tao was recruited second, Peters was recruited fourth.
  2) Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited fifth.
  3) Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, if White was recruited third, Villas must have been recruited second.
  4) Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited sixth.
  
Answer:
  E: White was recruited third. If White was recruited third, then Villas was recruited second, and Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, Quinn could have been recruited first, and Rovero could have been recruited fifth. So, the only option that could be true is that White was recruited third. Therefore, the answer is E.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest's website target being shorter than its voicemail target means Truvest's website target is either 1 or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 or 3 days.
  If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must also be 1 day, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 3 days. This would violate the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days. This would make Image's website target be 2 days, and Solide's website target be 1 day.
  Therefore, Truvest's website target being shorter than its voicemail target implies that Image's website target is 2 days, and Solide's website target is 1 day.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest has two targets, website and voicemail.
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days.
  Image has two targets, website and voicemail.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Since Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Since Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be 1 day and Truvest's website target must be 2 days.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, D, or E.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Analysis: 
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day, and its voicemail target must be 2 days. 
  Therefore, Solide's website target must also be 1 day, as it must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  This means that Image's website target must be 2 days, as it cannot be longer than its voicemail target, which must be 2 days.
  Finally, since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and we know that Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then Solide's voicemail target must be 3 days.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days. 
According to the given conditions, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, if Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be 1 day as well, which violates the condition. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days. Now Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day, which means Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days. According to the given conditions, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, and its website target must be 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days. Thus, the answer is D.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Truvest has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  - Two targets are set for each client, one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. The only option that meets this condition is option E. None of the other options relate to Truvest's website target being shorter than its voicemail target.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Truvest has a website target and a voicemail target.
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target must be at least 2 days.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Reasoning:
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target must be at least 2 days.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must be shorter than or equal to Truvest's website target.
- The only option that satisfies all the above conditions is E, which says "Solide's website target is 1 day."

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest
  - Targets: 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day
  - Two targets per client: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests
  - Conditions:
    1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then either Truvest's website target is 1 day and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, or Truvest's website target is 2 days and Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days. 
  
Analysis: 
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days. 
  - If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days. 
  - If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days. 
  - We cannot determine anything about Image's or Solide's targets from the given information. 
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has two targets: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  - Image, Solide, and Truvest each have two targets: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, we can eliminate options A and B since they both mention Image's voicemail target, which is not related to Truvest's targets.
  - We can also eliminate option D because it mentions Solide's website target being 2 days, which contradicts the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and we know that Truvest's website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target.
  - This leaves us with options C and E.
  - If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then its voicemail target must be longer than 1 day since the website target cannot be longer than the voicemail target. This would mean that Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days, which means that Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, according to the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. This would also mean that Solide's website target must be 2 days, according to the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, option C is true.
  - If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then its voicemail target must be longer than 2 days. This means that Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days. If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, according to the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. But this would mean that Image's website target is also 1 day since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This would contradict the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, if Truvest's website target is 2 days, then option E cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three clients: Image, Solide and Truvest.
  - Two targets are set for each client: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests, for a total of 6 targets.
  - Targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Action: 
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, we know that:
  - Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days (since it cannot be longer than its voicemail target).
  - Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days (since all targets are either 1, 2, or 3 days).
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's website target must be 2 days.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 1 day, while Solide and Truvest's voicemail targets are both 2 days.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Image's website target must be 1 day, and Solide's website target must be 2 days.
  
  Therefore, the answer is B: Image's website target is 2 days.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Truvest has two targets, a website target and a voicemail target.
  Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  Two targets are set for each client.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Reasoning:
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days. 
  Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, it means that Solide's website target is 1 day. 
  Since None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target and Solide's website target is 1 day, it means that Solide's voicemail target is also 1 day.
  Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets and Solide's voicemail target is 1 day, it means that Image's voicemail target is 1 day.
  Since Image's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target and Solide's website target is 1 day, it means that Image's website target is 1 day as well.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles is constrained by several conditions:
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the first three articles must be S, Q, and R, in some order.
  This means that G, H, J, and Y are the remaining articles, in some order.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, which means that the order of these articles must be J, G, R.
  This leaves H and Y to be the sixth and seventh articles, in some order.
  
  A: There is no way to know where J is in the order based on the given information.
  B: There is no way to know where J is in the order based on the given information.
  C: Q cannot be first, because S must be earlier than Q.
  D: Q cannot be third, because Q must be preceded by S.
  E: R cannot be seventh, because H and Y are the sixth and seventh articles.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The seven articles can be represented as follows:
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
  _  _  _  _  _  _  _
  
  G, H, J - finance
  Q, R, S - nutrition
  Y - wildlife
  
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the first three articles must be from the nutrition or finance category.
  Therefore, since S must be earlier than Y, S must be either first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third. This would mean that R must be fifth and G must be sixth, which is not possible since G must be earlier than R.
  If S is second, then Q must be third. This would mean that R must be fifth, G must be sixth, and J must be seventh. This is possible, but we cannot conclude that J is second or third.
  If S is third, then Q can be either first or third. If Q is first, then R must be fifth, G must be sixth, and J must be seventh. This is possible, but we cannot conclude that J is second. If Q is third, then J must be second and R must be fifth, with G being sixth. This satisfies all the conditions.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The articles can be ordered as follows: [F, N, F, N, W, F, N], where F is a finance article, N is a nutrition article, and W is the wildlife article.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  Y is fourth.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles can be: [F, N, F, W, N, F, N].
  
  A: J is second. This cannot be true because J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. If J is second, then G cannot be earlier than J.
  B: J is third. This could be true. If the order of the articles is [F, N, F, W, N, J, R], then Y is fourth, S is not earlier than Q, and no consecutive articles cover the same topic.
  C: Q is first. This cannot be true because S must be earlier than Q if Q is not third. If Q is first, then S cannot be earlier than Q.
  D: Q is third. This could be true. If the order of the articles is [F, N, F, Q, S, F, N], then Y is fourth, S is earlier than Q, and no consecutive articles cover the same topic.
  E: R is seventh. This cannot be true because J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. If R is seventh, then G cannot be earlier than R.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles is constrained by the following conditions:
    1. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
    2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
    3. S must be earlier than Y.
    4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fourth, then S is either first, second, or third. Therefore, Q is either second, third, or fourth. Also, since J must be earlier than G and G must be earlier than R, J must be either first, second, or third.

Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, then S is either first, second, or third. Therefore, Q is either second, third, or fourth. Also, since J must be earlier than G and G must be earlier than R, J must be either first, second, or third. Let's analyze each option:
  A. If J is second, then G is first, which means that H and J are consecutive articles covering finance, which contradicts one of the conditions. This option cannot be true.
  B. If J is third, then G can be either first or second. If G is first, then H and J are consecutive articles covering finance, which contradicts one of the conditions. Therefore, G must be second and H must be first. Then, Q must be fourth, R must be fifth, and S must be sixth. This order satisfies all of the conditions. This option must be true.
  C. If Q is first, then S must be second, which contradicts one of the conditions. This option cannot be true.
  D. If Q is third, then S must be first, which contradicts one of the conditions. This option cannot be true.
  E. If R is seventh, then G must be fifth and H must be sixth. Then, Q must be first and S must be second or third. This order satisfies all of the conditions. Therefore, this option can be true, but it is not a necessary conclusion.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  We have seven articles to edit. 
  G, H, and J cover finance.
  Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  Y covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Since Y is fourth, we can start by placing Y in the fourth slot. 

  __ __ __ Y __ __ __

S must be earlier than Y, so S is in slot 2 or 3. If S is in slot 2, then Q must be in slot 3. Since S and Q cannot be consecutive, R must be in slot 5. This leaves slots 1 and 6 for the finance articles, G, H, and J. Since J must be earlier than G, J must be in slot 1, and G must be in slot 6. This leaves H to be in slot 7. 

  J __ __ Y S R G H

Therefore, J is either first or second. However, Q must be third if S is earlier than Q. This means that Q cannot be first, and Q cannot be second either because J must be earlier than G. Therefore, Q must be third, and J must be second.

Action: Answer("B") - J is third.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The order of articles is: G, H, J, Q, R, S, Y.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

* If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be Q, R, S because S must be earlier than Y and S cannot be second because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
* J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, J must be fourth, G must be fifth, and R must be sixth.
* The only remaining article is H, so it must be first.
* Therefore, the order of articles is H, Q, R, S, J, G, Y.

Action: Answer("B") - J is third.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The seven articles are G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, the order of the articles can be one of the following:
  1. S _ _ Y _ _ _
  2. _ S _ Y _ _ _
  3. _ _ S Y _ _ _
  4. _ _ _ Y S _ _
  5. _ _ _ Y _ S _
  6. _ _ _ Y _ _ S
  None of the above orders allow S to be earlier than Q, so Q must be third. 
  Also, J must be earlier than G, so G cannot be second. Therefore, J must be second.
  The only option that satisfies this condition is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - G, H, and J cover finance
  - Q, R, and S cover nutrition
  - Y covers wildlife
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, the order in which the articles are edited could be: S-Q-R-G-J-H-Y
  
  A: J cannot be second because J must be earlier than G.
  B: J must be earlier than G, so J cannot be third if Y is fourth.
  C: Q cannot be first because S must be earlier than Q, and S cannot be first since Y is fourth.
  D: Q cannot be third since S must be earlier than Q, and S is already in second position.
  E: R could be seventh, since it is the last article to be edited, but we cannot conclude this from the given information.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, Y.
  - G, H, and J cover finance.
  - Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  - Y covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, the order of the articles is: S, Q, _, Y, _, _, _.
  The blank spaces must be filled with G, H, J, Q, R, or Y, without repeating topics.
  
  Possible orders:
  1. S, Q, G, Y, H, J, R
  2. S, Q, H, Y, G, J, R
  3. S, Q, J, Y, G, H, R
  
  A: J cannot be second in any of the possible orders.
  B: J must be earlier than G, so J cannot be third in any of the possible orders.
  C: Q is first in all possible orders.
  D: Q is third in all possible orders.
  E: R is seventh in all possible orders.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles follows the pattern: F-N-F-N-F-N-Y
  Where F represents finance articles, N represents nutrition articles, and Y represents the wildlife article.
  G, H, and J are finance articles.
  Q, R, and S are nutrition articles.
  Y is the wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. 
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles must be F-N-F-Y-?-?-?.
  We know that S must be earlier than Y.

Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, then the first three articles must be finance and nutrition articles.
  Therefore, the fourth article must be the wildlife article Y.
  S must be earlier than Y, so the order of the first three articles must be Q-S-N or R-S-N.
  If Q is third, then S can be earlier than Q.
  If R is third, then S must be the fifth article.
  Because of the rule that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, the sixth article must be a finance or nutrition article.

Action: Answer("D") 
The only option that satisfies the constraints is that Q is third. Therefore, Q cannot be first or second. Since S must be earlier than Q and Y is fourth, this means S must be the second article and R must be the fifth article. The order is F-S-N-Y-Q-H-R. Therefore, Q is third.

  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  According to the given conditions, we know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot be shown on the same screen. The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 3. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2. The western begins before the horror film, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2, but not on screen 3.
  
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film - This is possible if the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1 and the horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery - This is possible if the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1 and the mystery is shown on screen 2.
  C: the western, the horror film - This is possible if the western is shown on screen 1 and the horror film is shown on screen 2.
  D: the western, the mystery - This is not possible because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the western cannot be shown with the mystery.
  E: the western, the sci-fi film - This is possible if the western is shown on screen 1 and the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies being shown: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 PM.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Horror and mystery are shown on different screens.
  - Romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - Western begins before the horror film.
  - Sci-fi is not shown on screen 3.
  
Analysis:
  - The western is shown before the horror film, so it is always listed first in the schedule for the two screens showing movies at 7 PM.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown at either 7 PM or 9 PM on screen 1 or screen 3.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  - Horror and mystery are shown on different screens, so neither of them can be shown on screen 1 with the western.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  - In this option, the sci-fi film is listed first, and the mystery is listed second on screen 1 at 7 PM. However, the problem is that the mystery and horror movies are shown on different screens. Therefore, this CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives.
  The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there are no available sales representatives to work in Zone 3, which contradicts the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, A is false.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least one representative working in Zone 1 and at least one working in Zone 2, which contradicts the conditions that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, B is false.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there are at least two representatives working in Zone 3, which satisfies the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, C may be true.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there are at least two representatives working in Zone 3, which satisfies the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, D may be true.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there are no available sales representatives to work in Zone 3, which contradicts the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, E is false.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao (but not both) will have to work in Zone 2, and Udall will have to work in Zone 3, which violates the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly 7 sales representatives.
  - There are exactly 3 sales zones.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, we know that at least one of Parra, Tiao, or Udall works in each of the three zones. We also know that more people work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so either 3 or 4 people work in Zone 3, and either 2 or 3 people work in Zone 2. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and there are only 7 total representatives, we know that Parra and Quinn both work in Zone 1 or both work in Zone 3. If they both worked in Zone 1, then there would be no way to satisfy the other conditions, so they both must work in Zone 3. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, and there are more people in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we know that Stuckey and Udall both work in Zone 3. Therefore, we have accounted for 4 representatives in Zone 3 (Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall), and there must be at most 3 representatives in the other zones. This means that Kim cannot work in Zone 1 and Stuckey cannot work in Zone 3, so the false statement is A: "Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1."
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - Choice A: This is possible since there is no rule that prohibits Kim and Stuckey from working together in Zone 1.
  - Choice B: This is not possible since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, but only 2 sales representatives (Stuckey and Udall) are assigned to Zone 3, and none are assigned to Zone 2.
  - Choice C: This is possible since there could be more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Mahr and Stuckey could both be assigned to Zone 3.
  - Choice D: This is not possible since there are only 2 sales representatives assigned to Zone 3 (Stuckey and Udall), and Mahr cannot be assigned to Zone 3.
  - Choice E: This is not possible since Parra is assigned to Zone 1, and Stuckey cannot be assigned to Zone 1 (according to the given conditions).

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then the only sales representative left to be in Zone 3 is Mahr. But this violates the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, as there are only two sales representatives in Zone 3 (Parra/Tiao and Mahr/Udall) and three in Zone 2 (Kim/Stuckey, Quinn/Parra, and Tiao/Udall). Therefore, choice A must be false.
  - If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then the only sales representative left to be in Zone 2 is Mahr, and the remaining four sales representatives must all be in Zone 1 (Parra/Tiao, Quinn/Parra, Tiao/Udall, and Mahr/Udall). This distribution satisfies all the given conditions, so choice B could be true.
  - If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then the only sales representative left to be in Zone 2 is Kim, and the remaining three sales representatives must all be in Zone 1 (Parra/Tiao, Quinn/Parra, and Tiao/Udall). This distribution satisfies all the given conditions, so choice C could be true.
  - If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then the only sales representative left to be in Zone 2 is Kim, and the remaining three sales representatives must all be in Zone 1 (Parra/Tiao, Quinn/Parra, and Tiao/Stuckey). This distribution satisfies all the given conditions, so choice D could be true.
  - If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then the only sales representative left to be in Zone 3 is Mahr. But this violates the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, as there are only two sales representatives in Zone 3 (Parra/Tiao and Mahr/Udall) and three in Zone 2 (Kim/Stuckey, Quinn/Parra, and Tiao/Udall). Therefore, choice E must be false.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The company has 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The company has 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (Cannot be true because only 1 of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, so Kim or Stuckey cannot also work in Zone 1)
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (Cannot be true because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and Udall works in Zone 2, so Stuckey cannot work in Zone 3)
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (Could be true, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2)
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. (Could be true, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2)
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. (Cannot be true because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 1 since only 1 of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1)

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The seven sales representatives work in three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao would have to work in Zone 2, and neither of them can.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there would not be enough sales representatives to fulfill the condition that there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there would still be enough sales representatives to fulfill the condition that there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there would still be enough sales representatives to fulfill the condition that there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then either Tiao or Udall would have to work in Zone 2, and neither of them can.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The company employs seven sales representatives and has three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  From the conditions given, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone and that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 3. We also know that there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so there must be at least three representatives working in Zone 3. Since Tiao and Udall work in different zones, Udall must be working in Zone 3. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, Stuckey must also be working in Zone 3. This means that Kim cannot be working in Zone 3, so options B and C are true. Option D is also true because Udall is already working in Zone 3. This leaves options A and E to choose from. Since we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and we already know that Tiao is working in Zone 3, it must be Parra who is working in Zone 1. Thus, Kim and Stuckey cannot both be working in Zone 1, so option A must be false. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The company employs seven sales representatives to work in three sales zones.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than Zone 2.
  
A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is possible because there are three sales zones and it is not specified that only one representative can work in each zone. So, this statement can be true.
B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is impossible because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means at most two representatives can work in Zone 2. Since two representatives already work in the same zone as Stuckey, it is impossible for both Kim and Stuckey to work in Zone 3. 
C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means there can be at least three representatives in Zone 3.
D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means there can be at least three representatives in Zone 3.
E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is impossible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The question provides information about which sales representatives work in which sales zone, and provides several conditions that dictate which sales representatives work in which sales zone. 

A: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 1. This contradicts the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, this statement must be false.
B: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives who work in the other two sales zones (one in each zone). This contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, this statement must be false.
C: If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives who work in the other two sales zones (one in each zone). This contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, this statement must be false.
D: If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives who work in the other two sales zones (one in each zone). This contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, this statement must be false.
E: If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then Quinn must also work in Zone 1 (since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other). This contradicts the condition that there is either Parra or Tiao (but not both) who works in Zone 1. Therefore, this statement must be false.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Each day features one breed of kitten and one breed of puppy from three possible breeds of each.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Since there are only 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies, and each day features one of each, there are only 9 total pairs of breeds that can be featured.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly 3 days, so each of the 3 possible pairs including Himalayans must be featured exactly once.
- Rottweilers are not featured on any day with Himalayans, so each of the 3 possible pairs not including Rottweilers must be featured exactly once.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they can only be paired with 2 of the 3 possible breeds of kittens, and each of those pairs must be featured exactly once.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days, so the pair of breeds featured on day 7 must be different from the pair featured on day 6, and so on.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, then they must be paired with two of the three possible breeds of puppies. Greyhounds can only be paired with two of the three possible breeds of kittens, and each of those pairs must be featured exactly once. Therefore, Greyhounds must be paired with the two possible pairs of kittens that include Himalayans, which means they are featured on the same three days as Himalayans.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are three breeds of kitten and three breeds of puppy.
- There are exactly seven consecutive days, and each day features one kitten breed and one puppy breed.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Choice A: Since there are only three kitten breeds and three puppy breeds, it is not possible for four breeds to each be featured on three days. This choice is not true.
- Choice B: If Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, then they cannot be featured on every day that Greyhounds are because there are only seven days total, and no breed can be featured on two consecutive days. This choice is not true.
- Choice C: This is not true for the same reason as choice B.
- Choice D: If Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, then it is possible for Himalayans to be featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. This choice could be true.
- Choice E: This is not true because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- There are three breeds of kittens: Himalayan, Manx, and Siamese.
- There are three breeds of puppies: Greyhound, Newfoundland, and Rottweiler.
- The schedule lasts for exactly seven consecutive days.
- Each day, one breed of kittens and one breed of puppies are featured.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Choice A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then we would need a total of 12 days to feature all 4 breeds. This contradicts the given information that the schedule lasts for exactly seven consecutive days. Therefore, A is not true.
- Choice B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans would also be featured on day 1, which contradicts the given information that Himalayans are not featured on day 1. Therefore, B is not true.
- Choice C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Greyhounds would also be featured on day 7, which contradicts the given information that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, C is not true.
- Choice D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans must be featured on days 2, 3, and 4. This means that Rottweilers cannot be featured on any of those days, which contradicts the given information that Rottweilers are featured on at least one day. Therefore, D is not true.
- Choice E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers must be featured on days 2, 3, and 4. This means that Himalayans cannot be featured on any of those days, which satisfies the given condition that Himalayans are not featured on any day that features Rottweilers. Also, since Himalayans are not featured on day 1, they must be featured on days 5, 6, and 7. This satisfies the given condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days. Therefore, E could be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are three breeds of kitten - Himalayan, Manx, Siamese.

  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If all breeds of kitten and puppy are each featured on exactly three days, then the total number of days would be 18 (6 breeds x 3 days each). However, there are only seven days available, so this cannot be true.
B: If the Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans would be featured on day 1, which contradicts a given condition. Therefore, this cannot be true.
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans would be featured on day 1, which contradicts a given condition. Therefore, this cannot be true.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans would be featured on day 7, which contradicts a given condition. Therefore, this cannot be true.

- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If there were exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then there would be 12 days in total, but there are only 7 days. Therefore, A is not possible.
B: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans must be featured on day 1, which violates one of the given conditions. Therefore, B is not possible.
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Greyhounds must be featured on day 1, which means Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, violating one of the given conditions. Therefore, C is not possible.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7, which is consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, D is possible.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, which is consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, E is possible.

  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, the remaining breed would only be featured on one day, which violates the condition that each breed is featured on exactly one day. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, it means Himalayans are featured on day 1, which violates the condition that Himalayans are not featured on day 1. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, it means Himalayans are featured on day 1, which violates the condition that Himalayans are not featured on day 1. Therefore, C cannot be true.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7, which satisfies the condition that Himalayans are not featured on day 7. Therefore, D could be true.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on the days that Himalayans are featured, which satisfies the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, E could be true.

  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If four breeds are each featured on three days, then one breed will only be featured on one day, which violates the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. So, A cannot be true.
B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans will also be featured on day 1, which violates the given condition. So, B cannot be true.
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Greyhounds will be featured on day 1, which violates the given condition. So, C cannot be true.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans will not be featured on day 7, which satisfies the given condition. Also, Rottweilers will not be featured on any of the three days that Himalayans are featured, which also satisfies the given condition. So, D could be true.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers will be featured on day 7, which violates the given condition. So, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- There are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any 2 consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured for exactly 3 days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then there would be a total of 12 days required. However, there are only 7 days available.
B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans would have to be featured on day 1, which is not possible.
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans would have to be featured on every day that Greyhounds are not, which is not possible.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans would have to be featured on days 2, 4, and 6, which is possible.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers would have to be featured on days 2, 4, and 6, which is possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Three breeds of kittens (Himalayan, Manx, Siamese)
  - Three breeds of puppies (Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler)
  - Seven consecutive days with the following conditions:
    - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
    - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
    - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
    - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
    - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then we would need a total of 12 featured breeds. However, we only have 9 spots available (3 kitten breeds x 3 puppy breeds). Therefore, this cannot be true.
B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Greyhounds would be featured on days 2 and 4 as well. However, this would violate the condition that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, this cannot be true.
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans would also be featured on days 2 and 4. However, this would violate the condition that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, this cannot be true.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, this means that Himalayans would be featured on days 2, 4, and 6 (since Rottweilers are not featured on days 3 and 5 because those are Himalayan days). This satisfies the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days and that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, the answer is D.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, this would mean that Rottweilers would be featured on days 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. However, this would violate the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on day 7. Therefore, this cannot be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies.
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
  Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1, then the breed that will be featured on day 2 is either a Manx or a Siamese.
  Similarly, the breed that will be featured on day 3 is either a Manx or a Siamese but not the same as the breed on day 2.
  The breed that will be featured on day 4 is either a Himalayan or one of the two remaining breeds of kitten (Manx or Siamese).
  If a Manx or a Siamese is featured on day 4, then the breed on day 5 must be a Himalayan.
  If a Himalayan is featured on day 4, then the breed on day 5 must be one of the two remaining breeds of kittens (Manx or Siamese).
  The breed that will be featured on day 6 is either a Rottweiler or one of the two remaining breeds of puppies (Greyhound or Newfoundland).
  If a Greyhound is featured on day 6, then a Rottweiler must be featured on day 3, which violates the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  Therefore, a Greyhound cannot be featured on day 6.
  The breed that will be featured on day 7 is either a Manx or a Siamese.

Answer:
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The three possible targets are 3 days, 2 days, and 1 day.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("C")
  
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then it means that the possible voicemail targets are 2 days and 1 day. This also means that Image's voicemail target is 1 day since it has to be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. 

Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target and none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must be 2 days and Truvest's website target must be 3 days.

Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is (C) Solide's voicemail target is 2 days. It could be 1 day. 

So the answer is C.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. 
  - The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")

If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Solide's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days. If Solide's website target is 1 day, then it would be shorter than Image's website target, which is not possible because Image's website target can be at most 1 day (since its voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets). Therefore, Solide's website target must be 2 days. This means that Image's website target can be either 1 day or 2 days. Finally, Truvest's website target must be shorter than Solide's website target, so it must be 2 days. 

Therefore, all of the answer choices are true except for A: Image's website target is not necessarily 1 day. It could be 2 days.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then:
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  
A: Image's website target is 1 day. This statement does not conflict with any of the conditions listed above, so it could be true.
B: Solide's website target is 2 days. This statement is consistent with the conditions listed above because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, if Truvest's website target is 1 day, Solide's website target must be 2 days.
C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days. This statement is consistent with the conditions listed above because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
D: Truvest's website target is 2 days. This statement is consistent with the conditions listed above because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, if Solide's website target is 1 day, Truvest's website target must be 2 days.
E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days. This statement conflicts with the first condition listed above because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets and we don't know what Image's voicemail target is.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each client's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  There are two targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  
Analysis: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each client's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days. Therefore, options C and E must be true. 
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Thus, if Image has a voicemail target of 1 or 2 days then Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, option A must be true. 
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Thus, if Solide's website target is 2 days then Truvest's website target must be 3 days or more. Therefore, option D must be false. 
  Based on the previous analysis, the only option that is NOT necessarily true is option B.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  
  Based on the rules, we know that:
  - Image's voicemail target must be the shortest of all voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, that means the longest voicemail target is 2 days. Therefore, each client's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  
  A: If Image's website target is 1 day, then its voicemail target must be shorter, which is not possible.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days, which could be possible.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, which could be possible.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days, which could be possible.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, which could be possible.
  
  Based on the above analysis, the answer is A, because Image's website target being 1 day is not possible. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")
Reasoning: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
If Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then Image's website target must be 1 day as well, as none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's website target must be 1 day or 2 days, and Solide's website target must be 1 day. This means Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days, and Truvest's website target must be 2 days. Therefore, each of the choices A, B, C, D, and E could be true, except for choice A, which states that Image's website target is 1 day, which is not necessarily true if Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
- Six service targets are set for the three clients, two for each client.
- There are three levels of service targets: 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
- If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target cannot be 1 day, and it must be either 2 days or 3 days.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 1 day and the other two clients' voicemail target are 2 days.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Image's website target is 1 day, Solide's website target is 2 days, and Truvest's website target is 2 days or 3 days.
- Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is A: Image's website target is 1 day, because Truvest's website target could be 3 days.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the possible voicemail targets are 1 day and 2 days.
  
  A: Image's website target is 1 day. This is possible if Image's voicemail target is 1 day and its website target is not longer than its voicemail target.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days. This is possible if Truvest's website target is 1 day and Solide's website target is not longer than its voicemail target.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days. This is possible if Truvest's voicemail target is 1 day and Solide's voicemail target is not longer than its website target.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days. This is possible if Solide's website target is 1 day and Truvest's website target is not longer than its voicemail target.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days. This is not possible because if none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the possible voicemail targets are 1 day and 2 days. If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then its website target must be 1 day because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. However, this means Truvest's website target is longer than its voicemail target, which is not allowed by the first condition.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. The company sets two service targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  2. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  3. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  4. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
  - Since none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  - According to condition 3, Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is 1 day.
  - According to condition 4, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days, and Truvest's website target is 3 days.
  - According to condition 2, None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. So, Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 1 day.
  - Therefore, all options from A to D are true, and the only exception is option E.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Two photographs per section will appear in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - At least one but no more than three of a photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Fuentes or Hue. Therefore, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Gagnon.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This cannot be true because there are only two photographs per section, and Fuentes already has one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. This cannot be true because Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This can be true. If one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes. Therefore, both photographers have one photograph in the Metro section.
  
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This cannot be true because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. If Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section.
  
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. This can be true. If Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section and Fuentes has one photograph in the Sports section, then Gagnon must have one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Six different photographs will appear in three different sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we have the following possible scenarios:

- The third photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon.
- One of the photographs in the Metro section is by Fuentes. The other photograph in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, it must be by Hue. So, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
- One of the photographs in the Sports section is by Fuentes. The other photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue.
- None of the photographs in the Sports section is by Gagnon, so both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue.

Therefore, the only statement that could be true is (C) Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photos in total, two per section in Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photos in total.
  - There must be at least one photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section if there is at least one photo in the Lifestyle section.
  - The number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be equal to the number of Fuentes's photos in the Sports section.
  - Gagnon's photos cannot be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there must be at least one photo by a photographer who has at least one photo in the Metro section. 
If both photos in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then Fuentes would have 3 photos (in Lifestyle and Metro), and Hue would have 1 photo (in Lifestyle). However, this violates the condition that each photographer can have at most 3 photos.
If both photos in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then Gagnon would have 2 photos (in Metro), and Fuentes, Hue, and Gagnon would each have 1 photo in the Lifestyle section. However, this violates the condition that each photographer must have at least one photo in the Lifestyle section.
If exactly one photo in the Metro section is by Hue, then Hue would have 2 photos (in Lifestyle and Metro), and Fuentes would have 1 photo (in Sports). This satisfies the condition that the number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes's photos in the Sports section.
If both photos in the Sports section are by Hue, then Hue would have 3 photos (in Lifestyle and Sports), and Fuentes and Gagnon would each have 1 photo in the Lifestyle section. However, this violates the condition that each photographer can have at most 3 photos.
If neither photo in the Sports section is by Hue, then Hue would have 1 photo (in Lifestyle), Fuentes would have 2 photos (in Lifestyle and Sports), and Gagnon would have 2 photos (in Metro). However, this violates the condition that the number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes's photos in the Sports section.
Therefore, the only possible option is C: exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.

  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Analysis:
  - If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that there cannot be any photograph by Gagnon in the Lifestyle section. 
  - We also know that there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and since Fuentes and Hue have already been assigned to the Lifestyle section, that photographer must be either Fuentes or Hue as well. 
  - We also know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. If Fuentes has one photograph in the Sports section, then Hue must have one photograph in the Lifestyle section, which means that Hue cannot have any photograph in the Metro section.

- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
- One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.

Solution:
- One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. Therefore, there are no photographs by Gagnon in the Lifestyle section.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since there is a photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section, there must be a photograph by Fuentes in the Metro section as well.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, if there is one photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section, there must be one photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, neither photograph in the Sports section can be by Gagnon.

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. - This cannot be true since there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by Hue or Gagnon.
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - This cannot be true since there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by Hue or Fuentes.
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. - This is possible since one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue and one photograph in the Metro section must be by Hue or Fuentes.

  - Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer can contribute between 1 and 3 photos.
  - At least one Lifestyle photo must be by a photographer who has at least one photo in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle = Number of Fuentes's photos in Sports
  - None of Gagnon's photos can be in the Sports section.
  
  Given that one photo in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, we can deduce the following:
  - The third photographer, Gagnon, does not have any photos in the Sports section.
  - The number of photos by Fuentes and Hue in the Lifestyle and Sports sections can only be 1 or 2 each.
  
  A: This choice is not possible since it implies that Fuentes has all the Metro photos, which is not allowed.
  B: This choice is not possible since it implies that Gagnon has both photos in the Metro section, which is not allowed.
  C: This choice is possible. It implies that either Hue has the other Metro photo or Gagnon has one of the Metro photos.
  D: This choice is not possible since it implies that Hue has both photos in the Sports section, which is not allowed.
  E: This choice is possible since neither of Hue's photos is guaranteed to be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - 6 photographs in total, 2 in each section (Lifestyle, Metro, Sports)
  - 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue
  - Constraints:
    - Each photographer can have at least 1 but no more than 3 photographs
    - At least 1 photograph in Lifestyle is by a photographer who has at least 1 photograph in Metro
    - Number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle = number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports
    - No Gagnon's photographs can be in Sports
    
Given that one photograph in Lifestyle is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, we can deduce the following:
- Fuentes has either 1 or 2 photographs in Lifestyle section
- Hue has either 1 or 2 photographs in Lifestyle section
- Fuentes has either 0 or 1 photographs in Sports section
- Hue has either 0 or 1 photographs in Sports section

Let's go through each option:
A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
- If Fuentes has 2 photographs in Lifestyle, he cannot have any photographs in Metro or Sports.
- If Fuentes has 1 photograph in Lifestyle, he can have at most 1 photograph in Metro, but then he must have 1 photograph in Sports, which contradicts the constraint that Fuentes can have at most 1 photograph in Sports.
- Therefore, this option is not possible.

B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
- If Gagnon has 0 photographs in Lifestyle, then he must have 2 photographs in Metro, which means that Fuentes must have 2 photographs in Lifestyle, which is not possible.
- If Gagnon has 1 photograph in Lifestyle, then he must have 1 photograph in Metro, and Hue must have 1 photograph in Sports. This satisfies all the constraints, so this option is possible.

C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
- If Hue has 2 photographs in Lifestyle, then Fuentes must have 1 photograph in Sports and 1 photograph in Lifestyle (to satisfy the constraint that the number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle = number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports). This means that Hue must have 1 photograph in Metro, which contradicts this option.
- If Hue has 1 photograph in Lifestyle, then Fuentes must have 1 photograph in Metro and 1 photograph in Sports. This satisfies all the constraints, so this option is possible.

D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
- If Hue has 2 photographs in Lifestyle, then Fuentes must have 1 photograph in Sports and 1 photograph in Lifestyle (to satisfy the constraint that the number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle = number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports). This means that Fuentes cannot have any photographs in Sports, which contradicts this option.
- If Hue has 1 photograph in Lifestyle, then Fuentes must have 1 photograph in Metro and 1 photograph in Sports. This means that Hue cannot have any photographs in Metro, which contradicts this option.
- Therefore, this option is not possible.

E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
- If Hue has 2 photographs in Lifestyle, then Fuentes must have 1 photograph in Sports and 1 photograph in Lifestyle (to satisfy the constraint that the number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle = number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports). This means that Fuentes cannot have any photographs in Sports, which satisfies this option.
- If Hue has 1 photograph in Lifestyle, then Fuentes must have 1 photograph in Metro and 1 photograph in Sports. This means that Hue cannot have any photographs in Metro, which satisfies this option.
- Therefore, this option is possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs will appear in tomorrow's newspaper: 2 photos per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports section.
  - The photos were taken by three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who also has a photograph in the Metro section. This means that either Fuentes or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. If both Metro photos are by Fuentes, then there are no photos by a different photographer to satisfy this condition.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. This is not possible because if both Metro photos are by Gagnon, then none of Gagnon's photos can be in the Sports section. But there are only 6 photos available and at least one photo in each section must be taken by a photographer who has at least one photo in each of the other 2 sections.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is possible. If exactly one Metro photo is by Hue, then the other Metro photo must be by Gagnon. The remaining two Lifestyle photos are by Fuentes and a photographer who has a photo in the Metro section. The remaining two Sports photos are by Hue and a photographer who has the same number of photos in the Sports section as Fuentes has in the Lifestyle section.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible because the number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes's photos in the Sports section. If both Sports photos are by Hue, then there are no photos by a different photographer to satisfy this condition.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. This is not possible because the number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes's photos in the Sports section. If there are no Sports photos by Hue, then there are no photos by a different photographer to satisfy this condition.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section in Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - Gagnon's photographs cannot be in the Sports section.

We know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. This means:
  - The third photograph in the Lifestyle section can be by any photographer.
  - One photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  - The other photograph in the Metro section must be by any photographer other than Fuentes or Hue.
  - Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section and one in the Metro section.
  - Fuentes has one photograph in the Lifestyle section and one in the Sports section.

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible since we need at least one photograph in the Metro section by a photographer other than Fuentes or Hue.
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. This is not possible since we need at least one photograph in the Metro section by either Fuentes or Hue.
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is possible since one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue and we need at least one photograph in the Metro section by either Fuentes or Hue.
D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible since Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section.
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. This is possible since Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  A total of six photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, it means that none of the photographs in the Lifestyle section was taken by Gagnon. Therefore, at least one photograph in the Metro section must be taken by either Fuentes or Hue. If both photographs in the Metro section are taken by Fuentes, then there would be more than three of Fuentes' photographs in total, which is not allowed. If both photographs in the Metro section are taken by Gagnon, then there would be no photograph in the Metro section taken by either Fuentes or Hue, which violates the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.

  C: Violates the condition "F and K cannot both be selected."
  D: Does not violate any condition.
  E: Violates the condition "If M is selected, both P and R must be selected."

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Elimination: 
- In option A, there are two botanists and no zoologists, which violates the condition of including at least one scientist of each type.
- In option B, there are two chemists and no zoologists, which violates the condition of including at least one scientist of each type.
- In option C, there are two chemists and no zoologists, which violates the condition of including at least one scientist of each type.
- In option D, all three types of scientists are represented, and K and M are not both selected, which satisfies the conditions. However, P and R must both be selected if M is selected, which is not the case here. Therefore, option D is not a valid selection.
- In option E, all three types of scientists are represented, and K and M are not both selected, which satisfies the conditions. Also, P and R are not selected, which is acceptable since M is not selected. Therefore, option E is a valid selection.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Elimination:
Option A: 
  Includes only one chemist and one zoologist which is not allowed. 
Option B:
  Includes more than one botanist and more than one chemist. 
Option C:
  Includes only one botanist which is not allowed.
Option D:
  Includes one botanist, one chemist, and two zoologists which meets the minimum requirement. Also, it includes M and thus both P and R must be selected which meets the condition. 
Option E:
  Includes only one botanist which is not allowed.

Action: Answer("D")

Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  Option A includes only one botanist, F, and no zoologists. This violates the first and second conditions.
  Option B includes two chemists, K and L, but no botanists or zoologists. This violates the first condition.
  Option C includes one botanist, two chemists, and one zoologist. This satisfies the first condition. If F is selected instead of G, then the second condition is satisfied as well. This option is plausible.
  Option D includes one botanist, one chemist, and two zoologists. This violates the first condition.
  Option E includes one botanist, two chemists, and one zoologist. This satisfies the first condition. If G is selected instead of H, then the second condition is satisfied as well. However, this option violates the fourth condition if M is selected.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
- Mollie being assigned to 1922 does not have any direct effect on the assignment of the other students.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. 

A: Louis is assigned to 1924: This choice does not provide information about which year Mollie should be assigned to.
B: Onyx is assigned to 1921: This choice does not provide information about which year Mollie should be assigned to.
C: Onyx is assigned to 1924: This choice does not provide information about which year Mollie should be assigned to.
D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923: This choice means that Louis cannot be assigned to 1923. Since Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, Mollie must be assigned to 1922. 
E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921: This choice does not provide information about which year Mollie should be assigned to.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. 
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: Answer("D") 

If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, if Ryan is assigned to the project, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which would be 1922. This means Mollie must be assigned to 1921, and the only student remaining, Yoshio, would be assigned to 1924. Therefore, if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The project has four years (1921-1924) and six students (Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio).
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then the remaining years of 1922, 1923, and 1924 must be assigned to Louis or Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx, respectively. However, the condition "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923" cannot be satisfied because neither of them will be available to be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 and Ryan must be assigned to 1924. According to the condition "If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's," Onyx must be assigned to 1923. Therefore, the assignments are:
  - Mollie: 1922
  - Tiffany: 1923
  - Ryan: 1924
  - Onyx: 1921 or 1923
  The assignment of Onyx to 1921 or 1923 does not violate any of the conditions. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if Onyx is assigned to 1921.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. There is no condition that relates Mollie to Louis or to 1924.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. There is no condition that relates Mollie to Onyx or to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. There is no condition that relates Mollie to Onyx or to 1924.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. This answer choice does not necessarily imply that Mollie must be assigned to 1922. However, if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then only Louis can be assigned to 1921 or 1924. Thus, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. There is no condition that relates Mollie to Yoshio or to 1921.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. 
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
- If Louis is assigned to 1924, it does not affect Mollie's assignment.
- If Onyx is assigned to 1921, it means Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921, so she must be assigned to 1922.
- If Onyx is assigned to 1924, it means Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Onyx must be assigned to 1922, leaving no year available for Mollie.
- If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, it means Ryan must be assigned to the project, leaving no year available for Mollie.
- If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, it means Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921, so she must be assigned to 1922.

Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if Onyx is assigned to 1921.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. There is no direct relationship between Louis and Mollie.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. If Onyx is assigned to 1921, Ryan will be assigned to 1922, and Tiffany will be assigned to 1923. Since Tiffany cannot be assigned with Mollie, Mollie must be assigned to 1922. This satisfies the condition that if Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. There is no direct relationship between Onyx and Mollie.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, Ryan will be assigned to 1924. Since Mollie cannot be assigned with Tiffany, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922. This contradicts the given condition that if Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. There is no direct relationship between Yoshio and Mollie.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then the remaining assignments are:
    - Louis can be assigned to 1921, 1923, or 1924.
    - Onyx can be assigned to 1921, 1923, or 1924.
    - Ryan can be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
    - Tiffany can be assigned to 1921 or 1924.
    - Yoshio can be assigned to 1921, 1923, or 1924.
  Therefore, there are several possible valid assignments, but we can eliminate some options based on the given conditions:
    - Option A: Louis is assigned to 1924. This assignment is possible, but it does not determine Mollie's assignment.
    - Option B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. This assignment is possible, but it does not determine Mollie's assignment.
    - Option C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. This assignment is not possible, because if Ryan is assigned to 1924, then Onyx must be assigned to 1923.
    - Option D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. This assignment is not possible, because if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
    - Option E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. This assignment is not possible, because if Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Elimination:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. (does not help in determining if Mollie must be assigned to 1922)
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. (does not help in determining if Mollie must be assigned to 1922)
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. (does not help in determining if Mollie must be assigned to 1922)
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. (does not help in determining if Mollie must be assigned to 1922)
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. (does not help in determining if Mollie must be assigned to 1922)

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
- Four students are assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. 
- Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: Answer("D")

If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923. Thus, Louis must be assigned to either 1921 or 1924. If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921, violating the condition that if Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1921. This means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922 since Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's (who cannot be assigned to 1921), leaving Yoshio to be assigned to 1924. Thus, Mollie must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, the answer is (D) Tiffany is assigned to 1923.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  - Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  - If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles is either in bay 3 or bay 5.
  - If the bay holding textiles is in bay 3, then the bay holding livestock is in bay 2 and the bay holding grain is in bay 1, which means the bay holding fuel must be in bay 6 and the bay holding machinery must be in bay 4. However, this scenario contradicts the statement that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, the bay holding textiles must be in bay 5.
  - If the bay holding textiles is in bay 5, then the bay holding livestock is in bay 4 and the bay holding grain is in bay 3, which means the bay holding fuel must be in bay 1 and the bay holding machinery must be in bay 2.
  - Therefore, if bay 4 is holding produce, the type of cargo that each bay is holding is completely determined for exactly four bays: bays 1, 2, 3, and 5.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce. 
  Grain is located in a higher-numbered bay than livestock.
  Livestock is located in a higher-numbered bay than textiles.
  Produce is located in a higher-numbered bay than fuel.
  Textiles is located next to produce.

Bay 4 is holding produce. According to the rules, the bay holding fuel is next to the bay holding textiles. Therefore, the bay holding textiles must be bay 3, and the bay holding fuel must be bay 2. Moreover, the bay holding livestock must be either bay 1 or bay 2. However, the bay holding grain must have a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain must be either bay 3, 4, 5, or 6, and the bay holding livestock must be either bay 1 or bay 2.

Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are completely determined, which is a total of 5 bays. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  There are six bays numbered consecutively from 1 to 6.
  There are six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Reasoning:
  From the given information, we know that the bay holding fuel cannot be next to the bay holding produce. Therefore, the bay holding fuel must be either bay 1, 2, or 3. Since the bay holding produce is bay 4, the bay holding textiles must be either bay 2 or 6. If the bay holding textiles is bay 2, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 1 and the bay holding grain must be bay 5. If the bay holding textiles is bay 6, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 5 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. In both cases, we can determine the cargo type for four bays: the bays holding fuel and produce, as well as the bays holding livestock and grain. Therefore, the answer is (C) four.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds the cargo with the lowest number.
  Bay 6 holds the cargo with the highest number.
  Grain > Livestock
  Livestock > Textiles
  Produce > Fuel
  Textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

If bay 4 is holding produce, then the order of the bays should be:
  1. Fuel
  2. Textiles
  3. Produce
  4. _
  5. Livestock
  6. Grain

Therefore, the type of cargo that bay 1 and bay 2 are holding are completely determined (Fuel and Textiles, respectively). The type of cargo that bay 6 is holding is also completely determined (Grain). The type of cargo that bay 5 is holding is completely determined (Livestock). Therefore, for a total of four bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  Each bay is holding a different type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Solution:
  From the given information, we know that bay 5 must be holding textiles, and bay 3 must be holding grain. Bay 2 must be holding fuel, which leaves bay 1 with livestock and bay 6 with machinery. Therefore, the type of cargo that each bay is holding is completely determined for all six bays.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce. 
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. 
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. 
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. 
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. 
  There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we can deduce that the bay holding fuel should be either 1 or 2. 
  Bay 3 cannot hold textile, which means it must be holding livestock. 
  Bay 2 cannot hold livestock, which means it must be holding grain. 
  Bay 1 cannot hold produce, which means it must be holding fuel. 
  Bay 5 cannot hold fuel, which means it must be holding textile. 
  Therefore, bay 6 must be holding the remaining cargo, which is machinery. 
  Thus, the type of cargo for each bay is completely determined. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six bays numbered from 1 to 6. 
  - There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Approach:
  - If bay 4 is holding produce, we can infer that bay 3 or bay 5 is holding textiles. 
  - The bay holding textiles has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so livestock must be in bays 1 or 2. 
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so livestock must be in bay 1. 
  - The bay holding fuel must be in bay 2. 
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock and the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so grain must be in bay 3. 
  - Finally, machinery must be in bay 6.
  - Therefore, all bays are determined except for bay 4, which is holding produce.

Action: Answer("5")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 is on one side of the dock and bay 6 is on the other side of the dock.
  Six different types of cargo are being held, and each bay holds a different type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Solution:
  If bay 4 holds produce, it follows that bay 5 holds textiles, and bay 3 would hold fuel. 
  From the given information, grain can only be held in bay 6, and livestock can only be held in bay 2.
  Thus, the type of cargo for bays 1 and 6 are completely determined.
  Also, the type of cargo for bay 2 and bay 5 are completely determined.
  For bay 3, there are two possibilities: machinery or grain.
  For bay 4, only produce can be held.
  For bay 5, only textiles can be held.
  Thus, the type of cargo for exactly 4 of the six bays is completely determined.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are six bays numbered from 1 to 6.
  - There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Solution:
  - From the given information, we know that if bay 4 is holding produce, then bay 5 must be holding textiles.
  - Also, we know that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - Therefore, we can determine that bay 6 must be holding livestock and bay 3 must be holding fuel.
  - We cannot determine the type of cargo held in bays 1, 2 or 3.
  - Therefore, the answer is 3.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  
Solution:
  From the given information, we can deduce that the bay holding fuel is either bay 1 or bay 2, and the bay holding textiles is either bay 3 or bay 5. The bay holding livestock must be either bay 4 or bay 5, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 1 or bay 2. Since bay 4 is holding produce, we can conclude that:
  - Bay 1 is holding either fuel or grain, which means the type of cargo for bay 2 is completely determined.
  - Bay 3 is holding textiles, which means the type of cargo for bay 5 is completely determined.
  - Bay 5 is holding livestock, which means the type of cargo for bay 6 is completely determined.
  Therefore, for exactly 4 of the six bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We need to use the given information to determine the possible sales representative-zone assignments and then check which option satisfies the given condition.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: 
From the given information, we can conclude that:
- Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1 or Zone 3 together.
- Tiao and Udall work in Zone 2 or Zone 3 together.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
- There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

We need to consider the case where more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. This means that:
- Zone 2 has at most two sales representatives.
- Zone 1 has at least three sales representatives.
- Zone 3 has at most two sales representatives.

Let's consider each option:
A: Kim works in Zone 2. This is possible, but it doesn't give us enough information to determine the number of sales representatives in each zone.
B: Mahr works in Zone 2. This is not possible because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
C: Parra works in Zone 3. This is possible, but it means that Zone 1 has at least four sales representatives, which contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
D: Tiao works in Zone 1. This is possible, but it means that Zone 1 has at least four sales representatives, which contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
E: Udall works in Zone 3. This is possible, and it means that Stuckey also works in Zone 3. This leaves at most two sales representatives for Zone 1, which satisfies the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
Therefore, the answer is: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs seven sales representatives - Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall - to work in its three sales zones - Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at most two sales representatives working in Zone 3. 
  From the given information, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra and Udall cannot work in Zone 3. If either of them works in Zone 3, then there will be more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, which is not possible according to the question. 
  
  A: We don't know where Kim works. This could be true.
  B: We don't know where Mahr works. This could be true.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3. This is not possible.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1. This could be true.
  E: Udall cannot work in Zone 3. This is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis: 
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives in Zone 2 is in between the numbers in Zone 1 and Zone 3. 
  The sales representatives that are already placed in a specific zone are:
    Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
    Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
    Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
    Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Kim and Mahr have not been assigned to any specific sales zone.

Action: Answer("D")  
  Explanation: 
    If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3. Therefore, there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which is consistent with the given conditions. This means that Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 2 and Zone 3, but we don't know which person works in which zone. 
    If any of the other choices is true, then it would be impossible for more sales representatives to work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives who work in three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, it means that there are either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 1, and either 1 or 2 sales representatives in Zone 3. This means that at most 2 sales representatives can work in Zone 2. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1, so Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3, and Udall must also work in Zone 3. This means that there are 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  
Solution:
  A: Kim could work in Zone 2. There are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, which leaves at least 4 sales representatives for Zones 1 and 3. It is possible for 4 sales representatives to work in Zone 1 and 3 sales representatives to work in Zone 3. Therefore, this choice could be true.
  B: Mahr could work in Zone 2. There are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, which leaves at least 4 sales representatives for Zones 1 and 3. It is possible for 4 sales representatives to work in Zone 1 and 3 sales representatives to work in Zone 3. Therefore, this choice could be true.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3, because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, this choice is not true.
  D: Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, because more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, this choice is not true.
  E: Udall could work in Zone 3. There are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, which leaves at least 4 sales representatives for Zones 1 and 3. It is possible for 5 sales representatives to work in Zone 1 and 2 sales representatives to work in Zone 3. Therefore, this choice could be true.

Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B") or Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be either two or three sales representatives in Zone 1 and either one or two sales representatives in Zone 3. This means that there must be either one or two sales representatives in Zone 2.

Analysis of Choices:
A: Kim works in Zone 2. The question does not provide any information about Kim's sales zone, so it could be possible. However, it does not help to determine which sales representatives work in each zone.
B: Mahr works in Zone 2. The question does not provide any information about Mahr's sales zone, so it could be possible. However, it does not help to determine which sales representatives work in each zone.
C: Parra works in Zone 3. If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Udall must work in Zone 2. This means that there are only two sales representatives in Zone 1, and there are three sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that "There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2." Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
D: Tiao works in Zone 1. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, and Udall must work in Zone 2. This means that there are three sales representatives in Zone 1, and there are two sales representatives in Zone 3, which satisfies the given condition that "more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3." Therefore, this choice could be true.
E: Udall works in Zone 3. If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well, and Tiao must work in Zone 1. This means that there are only two sales representatives in Zone 1, and there are three sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that "There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2." Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  We are given a set of constraints that determine which sales representative works in which zone. 
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be 3 sales representatives in Zone 1 and 2 sales representatives in Zone 3. 
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are only 7 sales representatives and we already know that either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. 
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 2 because there are only 7 sales representatives and we already know that either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. 
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because we already know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  D: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be 3 sales representatives in Zone 1. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2. 
  E: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be 3 sales representatives in Zone 1. If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well. However, we already know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, which means they both cannot be in Zone 3. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  6. If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of representatives working in Zone 1 could be 4, and the number of representatives working in Zone 3 could be 3.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we can deduce that Mahr, Kim, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 1 because of the first condition. Also, Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because of the second condition. So, Mahr, Kim, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall must work in Zone 3. Therefore, only Parra, Tiao can work in Zone 1 and only Tiao can work in Zone 2. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 2 representatives working in Zone 2, and Tiao is one of them. So, the number of representatives in Zone 1 can be at most 2. Based on these constraints, we can check the given options.

Action: Answer("C")
The only option that is possible is that Parra works in Zone 3.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The company has 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - The sales representatives work in 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there can be at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  - If there are 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, and at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  - From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Also, either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, which means Udall must work in Zone 2. Therefore, there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, and the remaining 3 sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey) must work in Zone 1. 
  - If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, and Udall must work in Zone 2. Therefore, there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, and the remaining 3 sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey) must work in Zone 1.

Solution: 
  - The only option that is consistent with the given conditions is option D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
- There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives in Zone 2 must be 1 because there are only 7 sales representatives in total
- Since Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then the sales representative who works in Zone 2 must be either Tiao or Udall.
- If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra works in Zone 1. This means that Quinn must also work in Zone 1, since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone. Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. This leaves only Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3, which is not possible since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Therefore, Udall works in Zone 2, and Tiao works in Zone 1. This means that Parra cannot work in Zone 3 since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. So, Parra must work in Zone 1 along with Tiao. Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, which means that Quinn also works in Zone 1. Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3, which means that Kim, Mahr, and one other sales representative work in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that there are 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there can be maximum of two representatives in Zone 3 (as there are only 7 representatives in total). Hence, minimum of 3 representatives must work in Zone 1.
  
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 as there are already two people assigned to Zone 2.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 2 as there are already two people assigned to Zone 2.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3 as it is mentioned that there are maximum of two representatives in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao can work in Zone 1 as it is mentioned that Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Parra cannot work in Zone 3. Hence, Tiao should work in Zone 1.
  E: Udall cannot work in Zone 3 as it is mentioned that there are maximum of two representatives in Zone 3 and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey also needs to work in Zone 3, which will violate the given conditions. 
  
  Hence, the answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.

  - Reynaldo cannot test F
  - Yuki cannot test J
  - Theresa must test H
  - Seamus tests the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.

If Theresa tests J on the first day:
- Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, which is J. Therefore, Seamus cannot test H on the first day.
- Theresa cannot test H on the first day, because she tests J.
- Therefore, Reynaldo or Yuki must test H on the first day.

A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. - This is possible, but not enough information is provided to confirm or deny this option.

  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day is possible and not affected by the condition.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day is not possible because Theresa tests J on the first day and she must be one of the testers for H.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day is not possible because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, and Yuki cannot test J.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J is not possible because if Theresa tests J on the first day, Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day on the second day.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G is possible but not affected by the condition.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders are going to test four bicycles for two days.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the second day, because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

- Reynaldo cannot test F.
- Yuki cannot test J.
- Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
- The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J. So, Yuki must test either F, G or H on the first day. According to the rule, Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day on the second day. So, Seamus must test either F, G or H on the second day. Theresa tests J on the first day, so she must test either F, G or H on the second day. Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test either G or J on the second day.
- A: Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day. So, this cannot be true.
- B: Seamus must test either F, G or H on the first day. So, this could be true.
- C: Yuki cannot test H on the second day. So, this cannot be true.
- D: Seamus cannot be one of the testers for J. So, this cannot be true.
- E: Theresa cannot be one of the testers for G. So, this cannot be true. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 4 riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  There are 4 bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider will test one bicycle on the first day and a different bicycle on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Analysis:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the second day, as the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. 
  Since Theresa must be one of the testers for H, and she is testing J on the first day, it means that one of the remaining riders, Reynaldo, Seamus, or Yuki, must test H on the first day. 
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test either G or H on the first day.
  Therefore, (A) Reynaldo tests G on the second day is a possibility.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki are testing four bicycles F, G, H, and J over two days.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F, Yuki cannot test J, Theresa must be one of the testers for H, and the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then the following can be concluded:
      - Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo can test either G, H, or J on the second day.
      - Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki can test either F, G, or H on the second day.
      - Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day, which cannot be J, so Seamus can test either F, G, or H on the first day.
      - Theresa cannot test H on the second day, so Theresa can test either F, G, or J on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  - A: Reynaldo cannot test G since he cannot test F. This is not possible.
  - B: Seamus can test H on the first day since H is not reserved for Theresa or Yuki. This is possible.
  - C: Yuki cannot test H on the second day since H is reserved for Theresa. This is not possible.
  - D: Seamus cannot test J on the first day since J is reserved for Theresa. This is not possible.
  - E: Theresa cannot test G on the second day since G is not reserved for her and she cannot test H. This is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  5. Each rider will test a different bicycle on the second day.
  6. All four bicycles are tested each day.
  
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus, Yuki, and Reynaldo will test F, H, and G respectively. Since Yuki cannot test J, Seamus will test J on the first day. Therefore, Yuki will test the bicycle that Seamus tests on the first day, which is either F, H, or G. According to condition 3, Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so H cannot be the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day. This means that Yuki tests either F or G on the first day. Since Seamus tests J on the first day, he cannot test F or G on the second day. This means that Reynaldo tests F or G on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day is possible.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day is not possible because Theresa tests J on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day is not possible because Theresa tests H on the first day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J is true because Seamus tests J on the first day.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G is not possible because Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  - There are four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider tests one bicycle on the first day and a different one on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Action: 
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, Seamus must test the bicycle Yuki tested on the first day on the second day. Thus, Seamus tests either F or G on the second day. Since Theresa must be one of the testers for H, she cannot test G on the second day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test G on the second day. This means that Yuki tests either F or H on the first day. However, since Yuki cannot test J, she must test F on the first day. This means that Seamus tests H on the first day. Therefore, the only option that could be true is B: Seamus tests H on the first day. Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  
  If Theresa tests J on the first day. That means:
  - Yuki cannot test J on the first day. So, Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
  - Theresa must test H on the first day. So, Reynaldo and Seamus must test F and G, but the order is not specified. 
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. So, Seamus must test J on the second day, which means Yuki will test either F, G, or H on the second day.
  
Possible outcomes:
  - Reynaldo tests G on the second day: This is possible since Reynaldo can test F on the first day.
  - Seamus tests H on the first day: This is not possible since Theresa must test H on the first day.
  - Yuki tests H on the second day: This is possible since Yuki can test F or G on the first day and Seamus will test J on the second day.
  - Seamus is one of the testers for J: This is not possible since Seamus will test J on the second day, and Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  - Theresa is one of the testers for G: This is not possible since Theresa will test J on the first day.

Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - We need to find out the possible morning presenters for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
  - Tuesday is the only day George can present.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Kyle and Lenore will not present.
  
Solution:
  - We can start by eliminating the choices that include Kyle and Lenore, since they will not present. That eliminates options A, B, and C.
  - Option D includes Olivia, who cannot give an afternoon report, so it is also eliminated.
  - That leaves us with option E: Robert, George, and Helen.
  - This option is possible because it includes George, who can present only on Tuesday, and it does not include Olivia or Robert in the morning, who cannot give an afternoon report.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Six students will give oral reports during three consecutive days.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students giving reports must be: George, Helen, Nina, Irving, Olivia, and Robert. 
  -Tuesday: George must give a report. 
  -Wednesday: If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports. If Nina does give a report, then Helen and Irving do not give reports on Wednesday.
  -Monday: If Helen and Irving give reports on Wednesday, then one of them must give a report on Monday. Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, and Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, only Nina and George are left to give the remaining morning reports. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Answer("A") Helen, George, and Nina.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days – Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day – one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.

Action: Answer("C")  
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. 
As it is given that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they both will give reports in the morning. 
As George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he will give a morning report on Tuesday.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving both will give reports. So, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday. She will give a report on Wednesday.
Now, Let's see which of the given options satisfies the above conditions:
The morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
A. Helen, George, and Nina - This is not possible as Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday.
B. Irving, Robert, and Helen - This is not possible as Robert cannot give a report in the afternoon.
C. Nina, Helen, and Olivia - This is possible. Nina will give a report on Wednesday, George will give a report on Tuesday morning, and the remaining three students will give reports on Monday.
D. Olivia, Robert, and Irving - This is not possible as Robert cannot give a report in the afternoon.
E. Robert, George, and Helen - This is not possible as Robert cannot give a report in the afternoon. 

Therefore, the answer is C. Nina, Helen, and Olivia.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  * Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  * Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  * Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  * Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  * If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  * Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
Solution:
  * We need to determine the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, given that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  * Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, only six students remain to give reports.
  * Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must both give morning reports.
  * George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must give a morning report on Tuesday.
  * If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  * Let's consider the options:
      - Option A: If Helen, George, and Nina give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, then on Tuesday, Nina cannot give a report because Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday if Nina gives a report on Tuesday. So, Option A is not possible.
      - Option B: If Irving, Robert, and Helen give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, then on Tuesday, only Nina and Olivia are left to give reports. But Olivia can only give a morning report, so she cannot give a report on Wednesday because Robert has to give a morning report on Wednesday. So, Option B is not possible.
      - Option C: If Nina, Helen, and Olivia give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, then on Tuesday, only George and Irving are left to give reports. But Irving has to give a morning report on Wednesday because Robert has to give a morning report on Wednesday. So, Option C is not possible.
      - Option D: If Olivia, Robert, and Irving give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, then on Tuesday, only George and Helen are left to give reports. Since Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, she must give a report on Wednesday. Then, on Wednesday, Irving and Helen must give reports. So, Option D is possible.
      - Option E: If Robert, George, and Helen give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, then on Tuesday, only Nina and Irving are left to give reports. But Irving has to give a morning report on Wednesday because Robert has to give a morning report on Wednesday. So, Option E is not possible.
  * Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Olivia, Robert, and Irving. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Exactly 6 students give individual oral reports during 3 consecutive days.
  2. Exactly 2 reports are given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  We need to determine the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina. It is not possible because Nina can't give a report on Tuesday.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen. It is not possible because Robert can't give a report in the afternoon.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia. It is not possible because Nina can't give a report on Tuesday and Olivia can't give a report in the afternoon.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving. It is possible because none of them have any restrictions on the days they can give a report or the time of the day.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen. It is not possible because George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Six students out of eight will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then it means that they cannot be one of the students who will give a report in the morning on any of the three days.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students who will give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be George and Helen, Nina and Irving, and Olivia and Robert. However, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, the only possible combination is Robert, George, and Helen. Thus, the answer is (D) Olivia, Robert, and Irving.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. The seminar has eight students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  2. Exactly six of them will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  4. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  5. Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports.
  6. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports:
  1. George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert will give reports.
  2. Nina cannot give a report on Monday because then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible.
  3. Nina must give a report on Wednesday to avoid Helen and Irving giving reports on the same day.
  4. Therefore, Nina, George, and Olivia will give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  We need to determine which students can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Analysis:
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students giving reports must be: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. 
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  We also know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. However, this means that no one is available to give a report on Wednesday, which is not allowed. Therefore, we know that Nina's report must be given on Wednesday.
  This means that Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Tuesday, so they must give reports on Monday. 
  This leaves us with the following options for morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively: 
    Option A: Helen, George, and Nina
    Option B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
    Option C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
    Option D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
    Option E: Robert, George, and Helen

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 8 students giving reports: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  2. Exactly 6 students will give reports over 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  3. Exactly 2 reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  4. George can only give his report on Tuesday.
  5. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  6. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  7. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
Analysis:
  1. Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the students giving reports are: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  2. George can only give his report on Tuesday, so he cannot be giving a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then either Helen or Irving (but not both) must give a report on Wednesday.
  
Solution:
  1. We know that Olivia and Robert must give morning reports, so they could be the morning reports on Monday and Wednesday. 
  2. George can only give his report on Tuesday, so he cannot be giving a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  3. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Helen and Irving could not be giving morning reports on Monday. This eliminates choices A, C, and E.
  4. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then either Helen or Irving (but not both) must give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, we have two possible scenarios: 
      a. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday and Helen gives a report on Wednesday, then Irving could be giving a morning report on Monday.
      b. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday and Irving gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen could be giving a morning report on Monday.
  5. We can eliminate choice D because Robert must give a morning report, and he cannot give a morning report on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - George must give his report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  Let's check the options:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina. None of them can give a report on Monday morning since they have to give their reports on Tuesday or later. So, this option is not valid.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen. None of them can give a report on Monday morning since they have to give their reports on Tuesday or later. So, this option is not valid.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia. According to this option, Nina will give her report on Wednesday morning. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday and Tuesday must be given by George, Irving, Helen, or Olivia. However, George cannot give a report on Monday morning, and Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Tuesday morning. Therefore, this option is not valid.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving. According to this option, Nina will not give her report. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday and Tuesday must be given by George, Helen, Irving, or Nina. But, George cannot give a report on Monday morning, and Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Tuesday morning. So, this option is not valid.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen. None of them can give a report on Monday morning since they have to give their reports on Tuesday or later. So, this option is not valid.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves.
  - Each shelf must have at least 2 books.
  - More of the books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - If I is on the middle shelf, then there must be at least two more books on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf, since there are at least 2 books on each shelf.
  - If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top shelf, since there are more books on the bottom shelf.
  - If F is on the same shelf as M, then they both cannot be on the top or bottom shelf, since there are at least 2 books on each shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf together.

Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we know that F must also be on that shelf (since F is on the same shelf as M), and the remaining 5 books must be on the other two shelves. This satisfies all the conditions given, and thus the placement of all the books is fully determined.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are exactly 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf must have at least 2 books placed on it.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Solution:
  - If I is placed on the middle shelf, then we know that the top shelf cannot have more books than the middle shelf. Since more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, then I must be on either the top or middle shelf. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  - If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, if K and G are placed on the same shelf, then G must be on the top or middle shelf and K on the middle or bottom shelf. However, this is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  - If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then either both books are on the top shelf or both books are on the bottom shelf. However, this is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  - If M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, then either both books are on the top shelf or both books are on the bottom shelf. However, this is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  - If H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other, then either both books are on the top shelf or both books are on the middle shelf. However, this is not enough to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We have a total of 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  We have a total of 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  At least two books must be placed on each shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which shelf each of the other six books is placed on. Therefore, A is not the correct answer.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which shelf each of the other six books is placed on. Therefore, B is not the correct answer.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which shelf each of the other six books is placed on. Therefore, C is not the correct answer.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, it is fully determined which shelf each of the other six books is placed on. Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and K is placed on a higher shelf than F, we know that K, F, and M are all on the same shelf (either top or middle). We also know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so the remaining two books, G and O, must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, D is the correct answer.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, it is not fully determined which shelf each of the other six books is placed on. Therefore, E is not the correct answer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O).
  - There are 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, it does not provide enough information to determine which shelf each book is on. This is because we still don't know the positions of F, G, H, K, and L. Therefore, A cannot be the answer.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, it does not provide enough information to determine which shelf each book is on. This is because we still don't know the positions of F, H, I, L, M, and O. Therefore, B cannot be the answer.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, it provides enough information to determine which shelf each book is on. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, we know that K and M must be on the top shelf. This means that I must be on the bottom shelf, and since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the middle shelf. This leaves only the middle shelf for L and F, so they must be placed on the middle shelf together. Therefore, C is the answer.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, it does not provide enough information to determine which shelf each book is on. This is because we still don't know the positions of F, G, I, K, L, and O. Therefore, D cannot be the answer.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, it does not provide enough information to determine which shelf each book is on. This is because we still don't know the positions of F, G, I, K, L, and M. Therefore, E cannot be the answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf
  - I is on the middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M
  - Each shelf must have at least 2 books.
  
Analysis:
  - If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then F must be on a different shelf than both I and M, and we can determine the placement of all the remaining books based on the given conditions. Therefore, this statement is sufficient.
  - If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of the other books, since we do not know the placement of F, H, I, L, and O. Therefore, this statement is not sufficient.
  - If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of the other books, since we do not know the placement of G, H, I, K, and O. Therefore, this statement is not sufficient.
  - If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of the other books, since we do not know the placement of F, G, I, K, L, and O. Therefore, this statement is not sufficient.
  - If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of the other books, since we do not know the placement of F, G, I, K, L, and M. Therefore, this statement is not sufficient.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  We know that I is on the middle shelf and F is on the same shelf as M. 
  Therefore, if we know the location of one of I or F, then we can determine the location of the other.
  We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F and O is on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, if we know the location of one of K or O, then we can determine the location of the other.
  However, none of the choices include both I and either F, K, or O, so we cannot determine the location of all the books based on any of the choices.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than M and I. We also know that K and O would be on the remaining shelf, but we do not know which shelf that would be. Therefore, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if I and M are placed on the same shelf.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of any of the other books based on this information alone. Therefore, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if K and G are placed on the same shelf.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be on a different shelf than L and F. We also know that I would be on the remaining shelf. This would mean that K and O would be on the bottom shelf, and G and H would be on the top shelf. Therefore, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if L and F are placed on the same shelf.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than M and H. We also know that I would be on the remaining shelf. This would mean that K and O would be on the bottom shelf, and G and L would be on the top shelf. Therefore, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if M and H are placed on the same shelf.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of any of the other books based on this information alone. Therefore, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if H and O are placed on the same shelf.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are 8 books and 3 shelves.
  More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is on the middle shelf.
  K is on a higher shelf than F.
  O is on a higher shelf than L.
  F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we can deduce that M and F are on the same shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf and K is on a higher shelf than F, then K is either on the top shelf or on the middle shelf. Also, since O is on a higher shelf than L, then O is either on the top shelf or on the middle shelf. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf, then either K or O or both are on the middle shelf. Therefore, the only option that will allow us to uniquely determine the position of all the books is if H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other. If this is true, then we can deduce that K and I are on the top shelf, L and G are on the middle shelf, and F, M, and H/O are on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If I is placed on the middle shelf, we know that one of the other two shelves must have at least 3 books.
  - If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf. F cannot be on the top shelf, so it must be on the middle shelf.
  - If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf. L cannot be on the top shelf, so it must be on the middle shelf.
  - If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then both F and M must be on the middle shelf.
  - This leaves only G and H to be placed on the top shelf, and K on the bottom shelf.
  - So, if we know which two books are placed on the middle shelf, we can fully determine which book is on each shelf.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F and M are on the same shelf.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, it is not determined which shelves the other books are placed on. For example, F could be on the top shelf, K could be on the middle shelf, and O could be on the bottom shelf. Thus, A is not the answer.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, it is not determined which shelves the other books are placed on. For example, F could be on the top shelf, I could be on the middle shelf, and L could be on the bottom shelf. Thus, B is not the answer.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, it is not determined which shelves the other books are placed on. For example, K could be on the top shelf, I could be on the middle shelf, and O could be on the bottom shelf. Thus, C is not the answer.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, it is not determined which shelves the other books are placed on. For example, F could be on the top shelf, I could be on the middle shelf, and K could be on the bottom shelf. Thus, D is not the answer.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, it is fully determined which shelves the other books are placed on. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, and there are only three shelves, we know that O and L are on the top two shelves. Since H and O are on the same shelf, they must be on the bottom shelf. Thus, F and M must be on the middle shelf. This satisfies all of the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is E.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.
  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.
- There are five witnesses in total.

Reasoning:
- From the given information, we can infer that Franco cannot testify on Tuesday since he cannot testify on the same day as Garcia and there are only three days for the hearing.
- We also know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco cannot testify on Wednesday.
- Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday.
- Two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so the remaining witnesses (Garcia, Hong, and Jackson) must testify on Tuesday and Wednesday.
- Since Hong does not testify on Monday, she must testify on Wednesday.
- This means Garcia must testify on Tuesday, and Jackson must testify on Wednesday.
- Therefore, A, D, and E are possible schedules.
- B cannot be true because Franco cannot testify on Wednesday, and Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- C cannot be true because Garcia testifies on Tuesday, and Hong does not testify on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. Yuki tests the same bicycle that Seamus tests the next day.
  5. Each rider tests one bicycle on each day, and all bicycles are tested each day.
  
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then one of the following must be true:
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. (Not necessarily true. There is no connection between Theresa testing G on the second day and Reynaldo testing H on the first day.)
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. (Not necessarily true. There is no connection between Theresa testing G on the second day and Reynaldo testing J on the first day.)
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. (Not necessarily true. If Theresa tests G on the second day, she cannot test H on the second day because the riders must test a different bicycle on the second day than they did on the first.)
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. (Not necessarily true. If Theresa tests G on the second day, she cannot test J on the first day because Yuki cannot test J.)
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. (Must be true. If Theresa tests G on the second day, and Theresa must be one of the testers for H, then Yuki must be the other tester for H on the second day. By condition 4, Yuki tests the same bicycle that Seamus tests the next day, so Seamus must test G on the first day.) 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. 
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day. 

Action: Answer("D")

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day. Therefore, Theresa must test H on the first day. Since Yuki cannot test J, then Yuki must test F on the first day, which means Seamus must test J on the second day. Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test G on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test J on the second day. Thus, the only available bicycle for Theresa to test on the first day is J. Therefore, Theresa tests J on the first day.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H on one of the two days.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
  A: There is no information linking Reynaldo and H.
  B: Reynaldo cannot test F, so he cannot test J on the first day.
  C: Theresa must test H on one of the two days, but she tests G on the second day.
  D: Theresa must test H on one of the two days, so she cannot test J on the first day.
  E: Yuki cannot test J, and Yuki tests a different bicycle on the first day than on the second day. Therefore, Yuki cannot test H on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  5. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  6. Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
  We know that Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so she cannot test F or J. Yuki cannot test J, so he must test either F or H on the first day. This means that Seamus must test the bike that Yuki did not test on the first day, which is either F or J. Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test J on the first day. Therefore, H must be tested by Seamus on the first day. Since Theresa tests G on the second day, she cannot test H on the second day, so C is not true. Also, Yuki cannot test H on the second day because he tests the bike that Seamus tested on the first day, so E is not true. Therefore, the only answer that must be true is D: Theresa tests J on the first day.  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must test H on one of the days.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Yuki must test J on the first day (because Seamus will test the same bicycle on the second day that Yuki tests on the first day). Therefore, Seamus must test H on the first day, and Reynaldo must test F on the first day. This means that Theresa must test either F or J on the first day, but she cannot test J because Yuki will test it on the first day. Therefore, Theresa must test F on the first day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day. - Not necessarily true.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. - Not necessarily true.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day. - True. Theresa must test H on one of the days, and she already tested G on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. - Not true. Yuki tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day. - Not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  There are four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider will test a different bicycle on each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Theresa cannot test H on the second day.
  Thus, Theresa will test H on the first day.
  This means that Yuki will test J on the first day and Seamus will test J on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he will test H on the first day and G on the second day.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will each test one of four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) on the first day and then each rider tests a different one of the bicycles on the second day. 
  Reynaldo cannot test F. 
  Yuki cannot test J. 
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H. 
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  We are given that Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
Analysis: 
  Since Theresa tests G on the second day, she cannot test G on the first day. This means that Seamus tests G on the first day. 
  Yuki tests a bicycle on the first day that Seamus will test on the second day. Since Seamus tests G on the first day, Yuki must test either F or H on the first day. However, Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, Yuki tests H on the first day. 
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test J on the first day. 
  We know that Theresa must test H, but she cannot test it on the first day, so Theresa must test H on the second day. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- Reynaldo cannot test F.
- Yuki cannot test J.
- Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
- The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
- Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
- Theresa tests G on the second day.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then on the first day:
- Yuki cannot test G since Yuki's first-day bike must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
- Theresa must test H, since she must test H sometime over the two days.
- Reynaldo cannot test F.
- That leaves Reynaldo to test J and Seamus to test F.

Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, Reynaldo tests J on the first day, which means he cannot test H on the first day. So Reynaldo must test bike J on the first day.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  - Four bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider tests one bicycle on the first day and a different bicycle on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - Yuki's first-day bicycle must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test it on the first day.
  
Solution: 
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test it on the first day. Therefore, Theresa cannot test F, H, or J on the first day.
  - Theresa must test H on one of the two days. Therefore, she must test G on the first day.
  - Yuki's first-day bicycle must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, Yuki tests J on the first day and Seamus tests G on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F. Therefore, Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must test H.
  Yuki's first day bike is Seamus's second day bike.
  Each rider tests only one bike per day.
  Each bike is tested each day.
  
Analysis:
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she must test H on the first day, and the assignment of bikes on the second day is as follows:
  Yuki tests J
  Reynaldo tests F
  Seamus tests G

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The editor will edit 7 articles one at a time.
  Three articles (G, H, and J) cover finance, three articles (Q, R, and S) cover nutrition, and one article (Y) covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
A) If H is fourth, there are several possibilities for the order of the articles. Therefore, this is not enough to fully determine the order.
B) If H is sixth, there are only two possible sequences: Q-R-H-S-G-J-Y or S-Q-R-H-G-J-Y. However, the order of Q and S is not determined, so this is not enough to fully determine the order.
C) If R is fourth, the only possible sequence is: S-Q-H-R-G-J-Y.
D) If R is seventh, the only possible sequence is: S-Q-H-J-G-R-Y.
E) If Y is fifth, the only possible sequence is: S-Q-H-J-G-Y-R.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 articles to edit, covering 3 topics; finance, nutrition, and wildlife.
  Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article covers wildlife: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. 
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  We need to find the condition that fully determines the order in which the articles are edited.

A: H is fourth.
  This condition does not determine the order in which the articles are edited because we don't know where the other finance articles (G and J) are placed.
  
B: H is sixth.
  This condition does not determine the order in which the articles are edited because we don't know where the other finance articles (G and J) are placed.

C: R is fourth.
  This condition does not determine the order in which the articles are edited because we don't know where the other finance articles (G and J) are placed.

D: R is seventh.
  If R is seventh, then Y must be sixth, S must be fifth, Q must be third, and therefore G must be second, H must be first, and J must be fourth. This condition fully determines the order in which the articles are edited.

E: Y is fifth.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be fourth, and Q cannot be third because S must be earlier than Q. Therefore, this condition does not determine the order in which the articles are edited.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The articles can be grouped into three categories: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y). 
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. 
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. 
  S must be earlier than Y. 
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis: 
  If H is fourth, then G and J must be second and third in some order, but it is not clear which order. The remaining articles are Q, R, S, and Y, which can be ordered in many ways, depending on the order of G and J.
  If H is sixth, then G and J must be first and second in some order. The remaining articles are Q, R, S, and Y, which can be ordered in many ways, depending on the order of G and J.
  If R is fourth, then G and J must be first and second in some order. The remaining articles are Q, R, S, and Y, which can be ordered in many ways, depending on the order of G and J.
  If R is seventh, then G and J must be first and second in some order, and Q and S must be third and fourth in some order. The remaining articles are H and Y, which can be ordered in many ways, depending on the order of G and J.
  If Y is fifth, then the order of the other articles must be G, J, Q, S, R, and H or H, R, S, Q, J, G.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The articles can be grouped into three categories: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  - If H is fourth, then the order of the finance articles can be G-H-J or J-H-G. The remaining articles can be ordered as Q-R-S-Y. The order of Q, R, and S is not determined by this condition. The answer is not A.
  - If H is sixth, then the order of the finance articles can be J-G-H. The remaining articles can be ordered as Q-R-S-Y. The order of Q, R, and S is not determined by this condition. The answer is not B.
  - If R is fourth, then the order of the nutrition articles can be Q-S-R. The order of the finance articles can be J-G-H. The remaining article Y must be last. The answer is C.
  - If R is seventh, then Y must be fifth and S must be fourth. The order of the nutrition articles can be Q-S-R. The order of the finance articles can be J-G-H. The answer is not D.
  - If Y is fifth, then S must be first and Q must be third. The order of the nutrition articles can be S-Q-R. The order of the finance articles can be J-G-H. The answer is not E.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - G, H, and J cover finance; Q, R, and S cover nutrition; and Y covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  Let's evaluate each option:
  A: If H is fourth, we do not know which articles come before or after it. This option is not enough to determine the order of the articles.
  B: If H is sixth, then the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined. We can use the following order: J, G, R, Q, S, H, Y.
  C: If R is fourth, we do not know which articles come before or after it. This option is not enough to determine the order of the articles.
  D: If R is seventh, we do not know which articles come before or after it. This option is not enough to determine the order of the articles.
  E: If Y is fifth, we cannot place S as the article that comes before Y because S must be earlier than Y. This option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are seven articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three of the articles cover finance (G, H, and J).
  Three other articles cover nutrition (Q, R, and S).
  One article covers wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Solution:
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles could be Q, R, and S. However, we don't know if S comes before or after Q, so it's unclear what the next articles would be. Thus, the order is not fully determined if H is fourth.
  If H is sixth, then we know that articles Q, R, and S must come before it. We don't know the order of those three, but we do know that the first three articles must be G, J, and Y. Thus, the order is fully determined if H is sixth.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be S, Q, and either G or J. We don't know which of G or J comes first, but we do know that Y must come after them. Thus, the order is not fully determined if R is fourth.
  If R is seventh, then we know that the first three articles must be S, Q, and either G or J. We don't know which of G or J comes first, but we do know that Y must come last. Thus, the order is fully determined if R is seventh.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be S, Q, G or J, and either G or J (whichever one wasn't chosen as the third article). We don't know the order of those four articles, but we do know that the last two articles must be H and R. Thus, the order is fully determined if Y is fifth.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- There are 7 articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y
- 3 articles are about finance: G, H, and J
- 3 articles are about nutrition: Q, R, and S
- 1 article is about wildlife: Y
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic
- The order in which the articles are edited is subject to certain conditions:
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third
  - S must be earlier than Y
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R

A, B, C, and D do not provide enough information to fully determine the order of the articles edited because they do not provide any information on the order of articles related to finance, nutrition, and wildlife.

Knowledge:
- E: Y is fifth.
- If Y is fifth, then S must be third (because S must be earlier than Y).
- If S is third and Q is not third, then R must be third (because G must be earlier than R, and consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic).
- If Q is third, then R can be any position from fourth to seventh.
- If R is fourth, then G is fifth and J is sixth. It means that H must be seventh, but it is impossible because the consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, R cannot be fourth.
- If R is fifth, then G is sixth and J is seventh. It means that H must be fourth and Q must be third. The order of the articles edited is: G, S, Q, H, R, Y, J. This order satisfies all the conditions.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The articles are grouped into three topics: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Solution:
- If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, S (in that order), and the remaining articles must be edited in the order J, G, H, Y. This is because S must be earlier than Y, and G must be earlier than R. However, we do not know the order of Q, R, and S after the first three articles, so the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined.
- If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be Q, R, S, G, J (in that order), and the last article must be Y. This is because S must be earlier than Y, and J must be earlier than G. Again, we do not know the order of Q, R, and S after the first three articles, so the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined.
- If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, Y (in that order), and the remaining articles must be edited in the order R, G, J, H. This satisfies all the conditions, so the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined.
- If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, Y (in that order), and the remaining articles must be edited in the order G, J, H, R. However, this violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y, so the order in which the articles are edited is not possible.
- If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, R, G (in that order), and the remaining articles must be edited in the order J, H, Y. This satisfies all the conditions, so the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 finance articles (G, H, and J), 3 nutrition articles (Q, R, and S), and 1 wildlife article (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
To determine the order in which the articles are edited, we need to use the given conditions to create a sequence of articles that satisfies all the conditions. 
We can start by placing S first (because it must be earlier than Q and Y) and then place Q third because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Then, we can place Y seventh, as it cannot be earlier than S. 
We also know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, so we can place J second, G fourth, and R sixth. 
Now we have a sequence that satisfies all the conditions: S, J, Q, G, H, R, Y. 

Action: Answer("B") 
If H is sixth, we know that the first five articles must be S, J, Q, G, and R. The sixth article must be a nutrition article, but we do not know whether it should be Q or S. We also do not know whether the seventh article should be H or Y. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if H is sixth.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The articles can be grouped into three categories: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the order of the nutrition articles is QRS. However, the order of the finance articles and the wildlife article is not yet determined. Therefore, the answer cannot be A.
  If H is sixth, then the order of the nutrition articles is QRS. However, the order of the finance articles and the wildlife article is not yet determined. Therefore, the answer cannot be B.
  If R is fourth, then the order of the nutrition articles is QRS. Also, G must be earlier than R, so the order of the finance articles is GJH, and Y is last. Therefore, the order of the articles is fully determined. Therefore, the answer is C.
  If R is seventh, then Y must be fifth. However, the order of the finance and nutrition articles is not yet determined. Therefore, the answer cannot be D.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be earlier than Q, which means that Q must be third. However, the order of the finance articles is not yet determined. Therefore, the answer cannot be E.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf and F is placed on the same shelf as M. So, either F and M are both on the middle shelf or they are both not on the middle shelf.
  If G is on the top shelf, then at most two books are on the top shelf. This means that at least four books are on the bottom shelf, and at least two books are on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf if F is on the middle shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be on the top shelf if O is on the top shelf.
  
Analysis: 
  If G is on the top shelf, then we have at most two books on the top shelf. Since we know that I is on the middle shelf, the remaining book on the top shelf must be either F or M. If F is on the top shelf, then K is on the bottom shelf. This would mean that O is also on the bottom shelf, which would violate the condition that there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, F must be on the same shelf as M, which means that they are both on the middle shelf. Since L is on a lower shelf than O, L cannot be on the top shelf if O is on the top shelf. Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf with I and H. This gives us a complete and accurate list of the books on the middle shelf: H, I, and L.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F and M must be on the bottom shelf.
  If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the middle or top shelf.
  If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top shelf.
  We also know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the answer cannot be choice A or B.
  
Elimination:
  Choice A and B are eliminated based on our knowledge.
  Choice C includes L on the middle shelf but we know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so it cannot be on the middle shelf.
  Choice D includes K on the middle shelf, which is possible based on our knowledge.
  Choice E includes F and M on the bottom shelf, which is possible based on our knowledge.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F and M are on the same shelf.
  - If G is on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books, and the middle shelf must have at least 2 books.
  
Analysis:
  - If G is on the top shelf, then F and M must be on the same shelf, which means F and M cannot be on the middle shelf.
  - Since I is on the middle shelf, only one book from the set {H, K, L, O} can be on the middle shelf.
  - If K is on the top shelf, then F must be on the middle shelf, which violates the condition that K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - Therefore, K cannot be on the top shelf, which means K must be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, and K is on the bottom shelf, O must also be on the bottom shelf, which means L must be on the middle shelf.
  - This leaves the top shelf with only G and the middle shelf with H, I, and L.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, thus the middle shelf contains at least one book and can contain a maximum of three books.
  We also know that if G is placed on the top shelf, then H, I, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the bottom and middle shelves.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, and K is placed on a higher shelf than F, thus K must be on the bottom shelf and F and M must be on the middle shelf or vice versa.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, thus O must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the middle shelf must contain I and either F or M. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are eight books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and three shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  I is on the middle shelf.
  K is on a higher shelf than F.
  O is on a higher shelf than L.
  F is on the same shelf as M.
  If G is on the top shelf, then H and L cannot be on the top shelf because that would leave only one book for the middle shelf and that is not allowed.
  
Analysis:
  If G is on the top shelf, then F, H, I, K, L, M, and O must be distributed between the other two shelves.
  Since I is on the middle shelf, we know that F and M must also be on the middle shelf.
  Since K is on a higher shelf than F, and G is on the top shelf, K must be on the bottom shelf.
  Since O is on a higher shelf than L, and there are at least two books on each shelf, O must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the middle shelf.
  That leaves H to be on the bottom shelf with K and O.

Action: Answer("D") - I, K, L.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- There are 8 books and 3 shelves.
- More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- I is on the middle shelf.
- K is on a higher shelf than F.
- O is on a higher shelf than L.
- F is on the same shelf as M.

If G is placed on the top shelf, then either F or K must be on the bottom shelf. This means that neither F nor K can be on the middle shelf, so the middle shelf must contain I, L, and either H or M. 

Answer: Answer("D") - I, K, L.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We are given that there are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves.
  More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is on the middle shelf.
  K > F
  O > L
  F = M
  
Analysis:
  If G is on the top shelf, then only F, H, I, and L can join G on the other shelves since those are the only books that are not restricted by any rules.
  However, we know that I is on the middle shelf, so that means the other book on the middle shelf must be either H or L.
  Therefore, the possible complete and accurate list of books on the middle shelf is either H, I or L, I.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  We know that there are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at least two books on the top shelf.

Analysis: 
  Since G is on the top shelf, there are at least two books on the top shelf. This means that there are at most three books on the bottom shelf. 
  We know that I is on the middle shelf, so we cannot have H and L on the middle shelf because that would mean I is on the bottom shelf, which is not possible.
  We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so F cannot be on the top shelf. This means that F, M, and O must be on the bottom two shelves. 
  Since O is on a higher shelf than L, L must be on the bottom shelf. This means that H must be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I and H.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The following books are on the middle shelf: I
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F and M must be on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top or middle shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top or middle shelf.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We do not have any information about the placement of H on any of the shelves.
  
Analysis:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F and M must be on the bottom shelf. 
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so the only way for K to be on a higher shelf than F is for K to be placed on the top shelf and F to be placed on the middle shelf. 
  Similarly, the only way for O to be on a higher shelf than L is for O to be placed on the top shelf and L to be placed on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, we know that I, L, and O are placed on the middle and top shelves, but we do not know which books are on which shelf.
  We only have information about H being on the middle shelf if G is placed on the top shelf, but we don't know if H is on the middle shelf or not.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - If G is on the top shelf, then F and M are not on the top shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.

Reasoning:
  - If G is on the top shelf, then F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - We know I is on the middle shelf, so one of F and M must be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf, and at most 2 books on the top shelf.
  - Therefore, the only possible combination for the middle shelf is H, I, and L.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The auction takes place for 6 consecutive days.
  - The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

Action: Answer("D") 

If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then it's possible that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the correct answer is D: "The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase."
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and before the vase.
  - If the table is auctioned after the mirror and after the vase, then the earliest date it could be auctioned on is June 4th.
  
Analysis:
  - Option A is not possible because the table is auctioned after the harmonica.
  - Option B is not possible because the table is auctioned after the mirror, but the lamp is auctioned before the mirror.
  - Option C is possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it could be auctioned on June 2nd or later, and the table could be auctioned on June 1st.
  - Option D is not possible because the mirror is auctioned before the vase.
  - Option E is not possible because the sundial is auctioned before the mirror.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica is auctioned before the lamp or not at all if the lamp is auctioned before the harmonica.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before both the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  
Action: 
We can use the following deductions:
- Since the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, it must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
- If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned before the lamp, because that would mean that the table is auctioned before the harmonica, which is not allowed. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 4th. This means that the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, the sundial on June 2nd, and the mirror on June 6th. This scenario does not match the conditions of the problem, because the table is auctioned before the vase.
- Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 6th. This means that the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the vase must be auctioned on the other day. The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd. This means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd and the lamp on June 4th.
- Now we have two possible scenarios for the order of the harmonica and the vase: either the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st and the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, or vice versa.
- If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd. This means that the mirror is auctioned on June 4th and the vase on June 5th. This scenario does not match the conditions of the problem, because the table is auctioned after the vase.
- Therefore, the vase must be auctioned on June 1st and the harmonica on June 2nd. This means that the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd, the mirror on June 4th, and the lamp on June 5th. This scenario matches all the conditions of the problem.
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. If harmonica < lamp, then mirror < lamp.
  3. sundial < mirror and sundial < vase.
  4. table < harmonica or table < vase, but not both.

We are given that table is auctioned later than mirror and vase. Therefore, we can infer the following:
- The table cannot be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd because the sundial, mirror, and vase are auctioned on earlier dates.
- The only possible dates for the table are June 4th, June 5th, and June 6th.

Let's evaluate each choice: 
  A: If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table, then the only possible date for the harmonica is June 1st, which violates condition 4. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the only possible date for the table is June 4th, which violates the given condition that the table is auctioned later than the mirror and vase. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the only possible date for the table is June 4th, which violates the given condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: This statement is consistent with the given conditions. If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then it is later than the mirror and vase. If the mirror and vase are auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd (in any order), then the statement is true. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the question. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find the option that could be true based on the given conditions. 
  We are given that the antiques are auctioned one per day for six consecutive days. 
  The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Six antiques (harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase) are auctioned, one per day, for six consecutive days (June 1st through June 6th).
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  - We are asked to find the option that could be true.
  
Analysis:
  - Let's first note the orderings that must hold true based on the information given:
    - June 1st: [Not Sundial]
    - June 2nd: [Harmonica < Lamp] and [Mirror < Lamp]
    - June 3rd: [Sundial < Mirror] and [Sundial < Vase]
    - June 4th: [Table < Harmonica] or [Table < Vase]
  - Since we are given that the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase, it cannot be auctioned on any of the first three days.
  - Therefore, the earliest possible date for the table to be auctioned is June 4th.
  - For the option to be true, it must be possible for the harmonica to be auctioned on a date earlier than the table.
  - The only ordering that allows for this possibility is if the table is auctioned on June 4th and both the harmonica and the lamp are auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd in some order.
  - Thus, option A is possible.
  - Option B is not possible because the table cannot be auctioned on a date earlier than the lamp.
  - Option C is not possible because the table cannot be auctioned on a date earlier than the sundial.
  - Option D is not necessarily true and is not necessary for option A to be possible.
  - Option E is already given and does not provide any new information.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  We are given that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp for the mirror to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial must be auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.
  - The table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - If the table is auctioned later than the dates of the mirror and the vase, then the table must be auctioned on either June 5th or June 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This means the sundial must be auctioned on June 3rd or later, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd. This means the sundial must be auctioned on June 4th or June 6th, and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. This satisfies all the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Analyzing the options:
  A: If A is true, then the table must be auctioned on June 6th, but the harmonica can only be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: If B is true, then the table must be auctioned on June 6th, but the lamp can only be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: If C is true, then the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or later, which means that the mirror and vase must both be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. However, this contradicts the condition that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: If D is true, then the table must be auctioned on June 4th or later, which means that the mirror and vase must both be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This satisfies the condition that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: If E is true, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which contradicts the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. So, the sundial is auctioned on one of the days from June 2nd to June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. So, there are two possibilities here:
    1. Harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. Then, mirror and lamp must be auctioned on the same day after the harmonica.
    2. Lamp is auctioned on June 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. Then, mirror must be auctioned before the lamp and the harmonica must be auctioned on a later date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. So, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. Also, the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. So, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Explanation: 
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then there are only two possibilities:
    1. Table is auctioned on June 5th or 6th. Then, vase is auctioned on June 5th or 6th. But, the table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. So, this possibility is not valid.
    2. Table is auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. Then, mirror and vase must be auctioned on earlier dates than the table. So, the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th and June 6th in some order. Therefore, the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, or 4th and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st. Also, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. So, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 5th and the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th.
  Therefore, the only valid option is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in space 4 or 6.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
If the veterinarian is in space 5, and the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, then it must be in space 1 or 7. If it's in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2, which violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. Since one of the restaurants must be at the other end, then it must be in space 1. This means that the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses, so no other restaurant can be in space 4. Therefore, a restaurant must be in space 4 and the answer is C.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row, and seven businesses, each located in a space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
  
Analysis:
  - According to the given constraints, the pharmacy can only be in space 1 or space 7.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7, and the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the restaurant must be in space 1, and the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so if one restaurant is in space 1 or 7, then the other restaurant must be in space 4.
  - Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6, since that would make it next to the veterinarian.
  - Therefore, the only option that must be true is that a restaurant is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The shopping center has 7 spaces arranged in a straight row.
  Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in space 4 or 6.
  
Analysis:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in space 4 or 6.
  A: The optometrist cannot be in space 2 because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  B: The pharmacy cannot be in space 7 because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  C: A restaurant can be in space 4 because the pharmacy can be in space 6, then one of the restaurants must be in space 1 or 7, and the other restaurant can be in space 3 or 4.
  D: There is no information to determine whether the shoe store is in space 6 or not.
  E: The toy store cannot be in space 3 because it cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The veterinarian business is located in space 5.
  The pharmacy business is located at one end of the row, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian business.
  One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian business.
  
Analysis:
  If the veterinarian business is in space 5, then the pharmacy business must be in either space 4 or space 6. 
  One of the restaurants must be in space 1 or space 7, and the other restaurant must be in either space 2, 3, 4, or 6.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, if one of the restaurants is in space 1, then the other restaurant must be in space 4 or space 6. If one of the restaurants is in space 7, then the other restaurant must be in space 2 or space 4.
  The toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6 because those spaces are adjacent to the veterinarian business. Therefore, the toy store must be in either space 2 or space 7.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the optometrist or the pharmacy must be in space 4 or in space 6.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  There are only two possible spaces for the pharmacy: space 1 or space 7.
  The two restaurants cannot be together, so there must be at least one space between them.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in space 4 or in space 6. If the pharmacy is in space 4, then the optometrist or the restaurant must be in space 6, but neither of them can be there. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, which means that one of the restaurants must be in space 1. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the other restaurant must be in space 4 or space 6. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it must be in space 3 or space 7. However, if the toy store is in space 7, then the pharmacy and the restaurant cannot be at opposite ends of the row, so the toy store must be in space 3. Therefore, a restaurant must be in space 4.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The veterinarian is in space 5.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  There are seven spaces in total.
Analysis:
  We know that the veterinarian is in space 5, so we can start to determine where the other businesses must be located. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the pharmacy must be in space 4 or in space 6. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant cannot be in space 2 or space 6. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, so the pharmacy cannot be in space 4 if the restaurant is in space 7. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6. Therefore, the only option left is that a restaurant is in space 4.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in space 4 or 6.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 4 or 6. If the pharmacy is in space 4, then the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 3. If the pharmacy is in space 6, then the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 7. In either case, a restaurant must be in space 1 or 7, and the two restaurants must be separated by at least two spaces. Therefore, only (C) A restaurant is in space 4 must be true.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The veterinarian is in space 5. 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Analysis: 
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. So, the pharmacy must be in space 4 or space 6. However, the restaurant must be at the end opposite to the pharmacy. So, a restaurant cannot be in space 1 or space 7. Hence, a restaurant must be in space 4. Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 2 and the pharmacy must be in space 6. Now, we know that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the shoe store cannot be in space 3, so the toy store must be in space 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven spaces arranged in a straight row. 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then there are two possible configurations: pharmacy-veterinarian-optometrist-restaurant-restaurant-toy store-shoe store or pharmacy-optometrist-veterinarian-restaurant-restaurant-shoe store-toy store.
  A: There is no information about the optometrist's location.
  B: The pharmacy can only be in space 1 or space 6 according to the constraints. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 7.
  C: One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so a restaurant cannot be in space 4.
  D: There is no information about the shoe store's location.
  E: According to the two possible configurations, the toy store can be in space 3. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacy and a restaurant must be at opposite ends of the row.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, there are only two possible locations for the pharmacy: space 4 or space 6.
  
Analysis:
  If the pharmacy is in space 4, then the optometrist must be in space 3 and one of the restaurants in space 7. However, this means that the two restaurants are not separated by at least two businesses, so this option is not possible. 
  If the pharmacy is in space 6, then one of the restaurants must be in space 7. The other restaurant cannot be in space 4 because it would violate the separation rule, so the only place left for the second restaurant is space 2. The optometrist cannot be in space 2, so it must be in space 1. The shoe store cannot be in space 3 because it would violate the constraint with the toy store, so it must be in space 4. This means that a restaurant is in space 3, and the toy store must be in space 2.

  - Forest and turquoise cannot be used together.
  - Peach and turquoise cannot be used together.
  - Peach and yellow cannot be used together.

A: Forest cannot be used with turquoise, but there is no rule that prevents forest from being used with any of the other colors. Thus, there could be a multicolored rug that includes forest. This statement is not necessarily true. 
B: Forest cannot be used with turquoise, so there cannot be a multicolored rug that includes both colors. This statement must be true.
C: Peach must be used in one of the rugs because olive must be used with peach, and each color is used in only one rug. This statement must be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
  - Four public lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
Process of elimination:
  - If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must be earlier than the lithographs lecture, violating the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. So, A cannot be true.
  - If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden and Jiang would have to give the watercolors and oil paintings lectures in some order. However, this would contradict the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. So, B cannot be true.
  - If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden must give the oil paintings lecture, and Farley and Jiang must give the remaining lectures in some order. This is possible, so C can be true.
  - If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley must give the first lecture, and Garcia and Jiang must give the remaining lectures in some order. This is possible, so D can be true.
  - If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley must give the first lecture, Holden must give the oil paintings lecture, and Garcia must give the sculptures lecture. This is possible, so E can be true.
 
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic.
  - Topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  - Constraints:
    - oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be on the last topic (lithographs).
  - This statement can be true.

B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  - Nothing in the constraints prohibits this possibility.
  - This statement can be true.

C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If this statement is true, then Garcia's lecture must be the last one (Jiang's lecture).
  - However, in this case, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture which means that the sculptures lecture would be the second topic.
  - This is a contradiction with the statement that Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  - Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  - This statement is consistent with all the constraints.
  - This statement can be true.

E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If this statement is true, then Holden's lecture must be on the first topic (watercolors) and Garcia's lecture would be the second topic (sculptures).
  - However, in this case, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture which means that Farley's lecture would be the last one (lithographs lecture).
  - This is a contradiction with the statement that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians are giving lectures on 4 different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each historian gives a lecture on one topic only.
  - The order of the lectures must satisfy the following conditions:
    - Oil paintings and watercolors lectures must be given before the lithographs lecture.
    - Farley's lecture must be given before the oil paintings lecture.
    - Holden's lecture must be given before Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.

A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. (Possible)
B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. (Possible)
C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture. (Possible)
D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. (Possible)
E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture. (Not Possible)

Explanation: 
According to the given constraints, Holden's lecture must be given before Garcia's and Jiang's lectures. This means that if Jiang gives the watercolors lecture (option E), then Holden's lecture must be given before Jiang's lecture, which contradicts the rule. Therefore, option E is not possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The lectures are on four different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each art historian gives a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  The lectures are given one at a time.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
Analyzing the choices:
  A: If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must both come after the lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must come first, followed by Garcia's lecture, and then Jiang and Farley's lectures. This satisfies all of the constraints, so B can be true.
  C: If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must come first, followed by Garcia's lecture, and then Jiang and Farley's lectures. This satisfies all of the constraints, so C can be true.
  D: If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must come first, followed by Holden's lecture, and then Garcia and Jiang's lectures. This satisfies all of the constraints, so D can be true.
  E: If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must come first, followed by Garcia's lecture, then Jiang's lecture, and finally Farley's lecture. This satisfies all of the constraints, so E can be true.

Action: Answer("A")

    - oil paintings and watercolors lectures must be earlier than lithographs lecture.
    - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    - Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.

A: Farley giving the lithographs lecture is possible since it is not constrained by any other condition.
B: Garcia giving the sculptures lecture is possible since it is not constrained by any other condition.
C: Garcia giving the watercolors lecture is possible since it is not constrained by any other condition.
D: If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than Holden's, which means Farley's lecture cannot be the last one. This condition contradicts the fact that lithographs lecture must be the last one. Therefore, Holden giving the oil paintings lecture cannot be true.
E: If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture, which means Holden's lecture cannot be the last one. This condition contradicts the fact that lithographs lecture must be the last one. Therefore, Jiang giving the watercolors lecture cannot be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
There are four lectures, each on a different topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. Each art historian gives a lecture on a different topic. There are some constraints in the schedule of the lectures:
- The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

A: Farley cannot give the lithographs lecture because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture and the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
B: Garcia can give the sculptures lecture because there is no specific constraint related to either Garcia or the sculptures lecture.
C: Garcia cannot give the watercolors lecture because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, the watercolors lecture comes before Garcia's lecture, which contradicts this choice.
D: Holden cannot give the oil paintings lecture because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
E: Jiang can give the watercolors lecture because there is no specific constraint related to either Jiang or the watercolors lecture.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang
- Four public lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors
- Each historian will give a lecture on a different topic.
- The lectures will be given one at a time.
- The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then he must give the last lecture because the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. But Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which is a contradiction. Thus, A cannot be true.

If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden must give the watercolors lecture and Farley must give the oil paintings lecture. In this case, Jiang must give the lithographs lecture. Therefore, B can be true.

If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden must give either the oil paintings lecture or the sculptures lecture. If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley must give the sculptures lecture and Jiang must give the lithographs lecture. This is possible, so C can be true. If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Farley must give the oil paintings lecture and Jiang must give the lithographs lecture, which is also possible. Therefore, C can be true.

If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley must give the sculptures lecture and Garcia and Jiang must give the watercolors lecture and the lithographs lecture in some order. This is possible, so D can be true.

If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley must give the oil paintings lecture, Holden must give the sculptures lecture, and Garcia must give the lithographs lecture. This is possible, so E can be true.

Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  * The clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z are each mentioned once in chapters 1 to 7 of the mystery novel.
  * T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  * T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  * S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  * W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  * U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  * If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  * If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  * If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  * If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5, and W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  * If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, and T must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Based on the constraints, T can be mentioned in chapter 4, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 5. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be in chapter 3. U must be mentioned in an adjacent chapter to X, so U cannot be in chapter 1. R cannot be in chapter 3 because of the constraint that T must be mentioned before W, which means that T must be in chapter 4. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that T is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  * There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  * Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  * T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  * T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  * S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  * W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  * U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 7. 
  If T is mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3 only. 
  If S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then S can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4. 
  If W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then X can be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6. 
  If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then U can be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5.
  
Analysis:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. This is possible since there are no constraints on where R should be mentioned.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3. This is not possible since S can only be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4. This is possible since T can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3 and W must be mentioned later than T.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1. This is not possible since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5. This is possible since U must be mentioned adjacent to X and can be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5 and X can be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The mystery novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  Seven different clues are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
Action: 
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Therefore, S can be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T can be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W will be mentioned in chapter 5, and X will be mentioned in chapter 6, which contradicts the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W will be mentioned in chapter 6, and X will be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 1, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, R can only be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X will be mentioned in chapter 2, which contradicts the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  The only choice that is consistent with the constraints is C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  Because if T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W will be mentioned in chapter 6, and X will be mentioned in chapter 7, which satisfies all constraints.

  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  
Analysis:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, and T cannot be mentioned in chapter 7. 
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then R must be mentioned in chapter 3, and U must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not possible since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 3, and X must be mentioned in chapter 4, which also means that S must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - A mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7, is planned to have seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—each mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Action: 
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - Also, because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  - Therefore, S must be mentioned in either chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  - Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  - Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, it follows that:
    - If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then X must be mentioned in chapter 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
    - If U is mentioned in chapter 4, then X must be mentioned in chapter 5, and W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4, and W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then X must be mentioned in chapter 6, and W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  - So, if Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4, and T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  - From the given options, the only possibility is option C, which states that T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues, R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once in one of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in one of chapters 1 through 5.
  - If T is mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  - If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then U and X must be mentioned in either chapters 2 and 3, or chapters 4 and 5, or chapters 6 and 7.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and U and X must be mentioned in chapters 5 and 6 (in any order). This leaves chapters 1, 2, 3, and 7 for the remaining clues R and S. Since S cannot be adjacent to Z, and we have already mentioned S in one of chapters 1 through 5, the only remaining option is to mention R in chapter 3. Therefore, the order of clues and chapters is as follows: 
Chapter 1: U
Chapter 2: X
Chapter 3: R
Chapter 4: T
Chapter 5: W
Chapter 6: U
Chapter 7: Z
None of the other options could be true given the constraints of the problem.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  In a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. 
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
  
Analysis: 
  Since Z is mentioned in chapter 7, it means that neither W nor X can be mentioned in chapter 7 because Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters with S. This eliminates choices C, E. 
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 5, but this contradicts T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, choice A is not true.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 5, which also means that X must be mentioned in chapter 6, and U must be mentioned in chapter 4. This satisfies all the constraints, so choice B could be true.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which means that W must be mentioned in chapter 5, but this contradicts W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, choice D is not true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then neither S nor W can be mentioned in Chapter 6.
  
Analysis:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then neither S nor W can be mentioned in Chapter 6. 
  If T is mentioned in Chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in Chapter 6 and Z must be mentioned in Chapter 7. 
  If R is mentioned in Chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in Chapter 2, W must be mentioned in Chapter 5, and Z must be mentioned in Chapter 7. 
  If S is mentioned in Chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in Chapter 2, W must be mentioned in Chapter 5, and Z cannot be mentioned in Chapter 6, but must be mentioned in Chapter 7. 
  If U is mentioned in Chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in Chapter 2, and Z must be mentioned in Chapter 7. 
  If X is mentioned in Chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in Chapter 4, T must be mentioned in Chapter 2, W must be mentioned in Chapter 3, and Z must be mentioned in Chapter 7.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, the following could be true:
A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
B: S is mentioned in chapter 3.
C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
D: U is mentioned in chapter 1.
E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.

Analysis:
If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6. This eliminates choice B.
If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 7. However, this would mean that T and W were only separated by one chapter, which is not allowed. Therefore, choice C is not possible.
If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2. This would force T to be mentioned in chapter 3, and W in chapter 5. However, this would mean that T and W were only separated by one chapter, which is not allowed. Therefore, choice D is not possible.
If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4. This would force T to be mentioned in chapter 2, and W in chapter 6. This satisfies all the constraints, so choice E is possible.
If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W in chapter 6. This satisfies all the constraints, so choice A is possible.

Action: Answer("A or E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The clues to be mentioned are: R, S, T, U, W, X, Z.
  The chapters are numbered 1 through 7.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Also, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, so W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or earlier.
  Since T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or earlier.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so they must be mentioned in either chapters 2 and 3 or chapters 4 and 5.
  R must be mentioned in either chapter 1, 2, 4, or 5.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be five students available for the project.
  
Analysis:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, that means one of the years 1921 or 1922 will be assigned to her, and the remaining three years will be assigned to the other four students: Louis, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany. Since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, the remaining year will be assigned to one of the other three students: Louis, Onyx, or Ryan. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, Ryan must also be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, we can make the following deductions: 

  1. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then the remaining years will be assigned to Louis, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany. If Louis is not assigned to the project, then the only possibility is that he is assigned to 1923, because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to that year. This means that Tiffany must be assigned to one of the years 1921 or 1922, and since Ryan must be assigned to the project if Tiffany is assigned to the project, Ryan must be assigned to the remaining year. This means that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is not possible, since there are only four years, and we have already assigned three of them. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to the project. This means that Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to 1924. This leaves 1921 and 1922 for Mollie and Onyx, but we don't know which student will be assigned to which year. 

  2. If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then the remaining four years will be assigned to Louis, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany. Since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany is not available for the project, Louis must be assigned to 1923. This means that Ryan must be assigned to 1924, and Onyx must be assigned to 1923. This leaves 1921 and 1922 for Louis and Tiffany, but we don't know which student will be assigned to which year. 

Answer:
  From the above analysis, we can see that if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it could be true that:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project. (This is not possible, because if Mollie is assigned to the project, Louis must be assigned to the project.)
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project. (This is not possible, because if Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.)
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project. (This is possible, and we have already seen one scenario in which this happens.)
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922. (This is possible, and we have already seen one scenario in which this happens.)
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924. (This is not possible, because Louis must be assigned to 1923.)  

Therefore, the correct answer is: Answer("C").
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The project has four years and four students, each assigned to one year.
  - Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be five students available for four years, and the conditions mentioned above still apply.
  A: The project has only four years, so one student must be assigned to each year. If Louis is not assigned to the project, who will be assigned to 1923?
  B: If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then who will be assigned to the year immediately prior to Onyx's year? This violates the condition that applies if Ryan is assigned to the project.
  C: If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then who will be assigned to 1923? This violates the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  D: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then who will be assigned to 1923? This violates the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then who will be assigned to 1923? This violates the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are six students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  Each year from 1921 to 1924 will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  The following conditions apply:
    - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
    - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
    - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
    - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  We need to determine which of the following could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the four remaining students must be assigned to the four years. We don't know which student will be assigned to which year, but we do know that certain students cannot be assigned to certain years based on the given conditions. 
  
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then either Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, or Tiffany would have to be assigned to 1923. However, only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so Louis not being assigned to the project is not possible.
  
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. This means that either Mollie, Onyx, or Louis would have to be assigned to 1923, but only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Ryan not being assigned to the project is not possible.
  
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project because if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project. This means that either Mollie, Onyx, or Louis would have to be assigned to 1923, but only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Tiffany not being assigned to the project is not possible.
  
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. This means that Louis and Mollie would have to be assigned to 1921 and 1924 (in some order). This is possible because Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Louis must be assigned to 1924. Therefore, Onyx being assigned to 1922 is possible.
  
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then either Mollie, Onyx, or Ryan would have to be assigned to 1923. However, only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so Louis being assigned to 1924 is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D") - Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be five students available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany. 
According to the given conditions, if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This means that if Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must also be assigned, and there will be no student left to be assigned to the remaining year. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. 
If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, one of the remaining students will be assigned to 1923, and the other remaining student will be assigned to 1924. This means that Louis could be assigned to the project, and therefore, Louis is not assigned to the project could be true. Therefore, the answer is A.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  2. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  3. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  4. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  5. Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Solution:
  We can start by finding out who can be assigned to 1923. From the first condition, we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then we can assign one of the available students to 1923. This means that Louis and Tiffany are available for other years. 
  
  Now, we can use the second and third conditions to find out if Mollie is assigned to the project or if Tiffany is assigned to the project. 
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. This means that Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 and the remaining student must be assigned to 1924. 
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. This means that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is either 1922 or 1923. The remaining student must be assigned to 1921 or 1924.
  
  If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then we can assign the remaining students to the available years. If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project (from the third condition). If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to any year (from the fourth condition). Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Louis is not assigned to the project.
  
  Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Each year should have exactly one student assigned to it.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be five students available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  
  A: We need at least one student to be assigned to 1923, and Louis is the only other student besides Tiffany who can be assigned to that year. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to the project, and A is not possible.
  B: If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then neither is Onyx, because Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This leaves only Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany available to be assigned to the four years, but we need four students for the project. Therefore, B is not possible.
  C: If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, according to the condition that "If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project." Therefore, C is possible.
  D: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, according to the condition that "If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's." This leaves only Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany available to be assigned to 1921 and 1924, but we need four students for the project. Therefore, D is not possible.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, according to the rule that "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923." This leaves only Mollie, Onyx, and Ryan available to be assigned to 1921 and 1922, but we need four students for the project. Therefore, E is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The project involves 4 students assigned to 4 different years.
- Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned.
- If Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: 
- If Yoshio is not assigned, there are 5 students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
- Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so either one of them could be assigned to that year.
- If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. This means that either Onyx or Ryan must be assigned to 1922 or 1923, respectively.
- If Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned to the project. This means that either Onyx or Mollie must be assigned to 1922 or 1921, respectively.
- If Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This means that either Onyx or Mollie must be assigned to 1923 or 1922, respectively.

- Based on the above conditions, the only option that could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project is:
Answer("D"): Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have four students assigned to it, each assigned to one of the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  Since there are six students available, two of them will not be assigned to the project.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are five students available for the project. 
  Since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany is not available for the project, Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Since Louis is assigned to 1923, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922, so she must be assigned to 1921.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan must not be assigned to the project. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's year.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, it is possible that Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have four students assigned, one for each year between 1921 and 1924.
  Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned.
  If Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

  If Yoshio is not assigned, there are only five students available for the project.
  A: Louis not being assigned is not possible because Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 and there are only five available students.
  B: Ryan not being assigned is possible because if Tiffany is not assigned, then Ryan is not assigned either and vice versa.
  C: Tiffany not being assigned is possible because if Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany is not assigned to the project and vice versa.
  D: Onyx being assigned to 1922 is possible because if Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis being assigned to 1924 is not possible because Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 and there are only five available students.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 4 years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  2. Each year will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  3. Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  4. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  5. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  6. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be a total of 5 students available for the project. 
We can assign the students to the years as follows:
- If Louis is assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to any of the remaining three years, leaving four students available for the remaining three years. Since Mollie cannot be assigned to the same year as Tiffany, the only year left for Mollie is 1921. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1921, which leaves three students available for the remaining two years. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1922, which leaves two students available for the remaining year. Louis cannot be assigned to 1924 because Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, and Louis is the only remaining student. Therefore, Louis is not assigned to the project. 
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Ryan cannot be assigned to any of the remaining three years, leaving four students available for the remaining three years. Since Mollie cannot be assigned to the same year as Tiffany, the only year left for Mollie is 1921. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1921, which leaves three students available for the remaining two years. Onyx cannot be assigned to 1924 because Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, and Ryan cannot be assigned to 1924. Therefore, Onyx is assigned to 1922, leaving two students available for the remaining year. Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany is already assigned to the project. Therefore, Louis is not assigned to the project. 
- If neither Louis nor Tiffany is assigned to the project, then either Ryan or Mollie must be assigned to 1923. If Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922, leaving four students available for the remaining two years. Since Mollie cannot be assigned to the same year as Tiffany, the only year left for Mollie is 1921. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1921, leaving three students available for the remaining year. Louis cannot be assigned to 1924 because Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. Therefore, Louis is not assigned to the project. If Mollie is assigned to 1923, then Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Mollie is assigned to 1921, leaving four students available for the remaining three years. Onyx cannot be assigned to 1924 because Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, and Ryan cannot be assigned to 1924. Therefore, Onyx is assigned to 1922, leaving three students available for the remaining year. Tiffany cannot be assigned to the remaining year because Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 if she is assigned to the project. Therefore, Tiffany is not assigned to the project. 
Thus, it is possible that Tiffany is not assigned to the project.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. M is published in the fall, so N must be published in the spring.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  
Using the conditions above, we can deduce that if M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. 

A: K and O cannot both be published in the fall if M is published in the fall.
B: N must be published in the spring if M is published in the fall. 
C: L cannot be published in the fall with M and N because K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
D: P cannot be published in the fall with M because M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
E: O cannot be published in the fall with M and N because K and N must be published in the same season as each other.

Therefore, the correct pair of cookbooks that could be published in the fall with M is L and O. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  - If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring, and P cannot be published in the fall, so it must be published in the spring.
  - If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, K, M, and O must be published in the fall. N cannot be published in the fall, so L and P must be published in the spring.
  - If L is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. P cannot be published in the fall, so K, M, and O must be published in the fall. Therefore, there is no pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring, according to condition 4. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall. So, we need to find a pair of cookbooks that can be published in the fall with M, and neither of them is N or P. According to condition 1, P cannot be published in the fall with M, so we can eliminate choices D and E. According to condition 3, if K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, if K is not published in the fall, then O cannot be published in the fall. So, if M is published in the fall and K is not published in the fall, then O cannot be one of the cookbooks published in the fall with M. Therefore, we can eliminate choice A. This leaves us with choices B and C. According to condition 2, K and N must be published in the same season as each other. Since N cannot be published in the fall, then K must be published in the spring with N. Therefore, we can eliminate choice B. This leaves us with only one possible answer:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  - K and N must be published in the same season.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  - If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  - If M is published in the fall, then P cannot be published in the fall. Therefore P must be published in the spring with N.
  - If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. Therefore K and O can be published in the fall with M.
  - If L is published in the fall, then there are no restrictions on the other cookbook to be published in the fall with M.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Cookbooks L and O can be published in the fall with M.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Let's consider each option:
  A: If M is published in the fall, K must be published in the fall, which means O must also be published in the fall. But K and N must be published in the same season. Therefore, N can't be published in the spring, which contradicts condition 4. So, K and O can't both be published in the fall. Not a valid answer.
  B: If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, which means K must also be published in the spring. Not a valid answer.
  C: If L is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. But K and N must be published in the same season. Therefore, K and O can't both be published in the fall. Not a valid answer.
  D: If N is published in the fall, K and O must also be published in the fall. But P can't be published in the same season as M. Therefore, P can't be published in the fall. Not a valid answer.
  E: If O is published in the fall, K must also be published in the fall. But N can't be published in the fall, which contradicts condition 4. So, O and P can't both be published in the fall. Not a valid answer.
  
Therefore, there is no valid answer. If M is published in the fall, no pair of cookbooks can be published in the fall along with M. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  
Elimination:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, so B and D can be eliminated.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Since we don't know if K is to be published in the fall, we can't determine if O can be published in the fall. Therefore, A can be eliminated.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  If M is published in the fall, then P cannot be published in the fall. Therefore, we can only choose between L and O. However, if K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. We don't know if K is to be published in the fall, so we can't determine if O can be published in the fall. Therefore, the only possible pair of cookbooks to be published in the fall along with M is L and O.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. M cannot be published in the same season as P, so P must be published in the spring if M is published in the fall.
  2. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, so N cannot be published in the fall.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, P cannot be published in the fall, so P must be published in the spring. N must also be published in the spring if M is published in the fall. K and O must be published in the fall if K is published in the fall. Since K and N must be published in the same season, if K is published in the fall, then N must also be published in the fall. Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. M is published in the fall.
  2. M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  3. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  4. K and N must be published in the same season.
  5. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.

Analysis:
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K, N, and O cannot be published in the fall.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season. Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall.
  - Based on the above, the only possible cookbooks that can be published in the fall alongside M are L and 0.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - M cannot be published in the same season as P.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and N must be published in the same season (i.e., spring).
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  
Analysis:
  - If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and N must be published in the same season (i.e., spring).
  - If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall, which means that the remaining cookbooks L and P must be published in the spring.
  - Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  - K and N must be published in the same season.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. 

Analysis: 
  Since M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. P cannot be published in the fall because P and M cannot be published in the same season. Therefore, L and N could both be published in the fall with M.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, the compositions performed first, second, and third must be either O, F, and R, or R, F, and O.
  
  A: H cannot be performed before R because then T would have to be performed immediately after H, which is not allowed. Also, if H is the eighth composition performed, then it cannot be performed after P, which is not allowed.
  B: P cannot be performed before S because P is performed before S. Also, L cannot be performed after P because L is the eighth composition performed.
  C: This is a valid sequence of compositions. O is performed first, P is performed second, and R is performed third.
  D: If T is performed third, then F cannot be performed after R, which is not allowed. Also, if T is performed third, then S must be performed last, which is not allowed because L or H must be performed last.
  E: This is not a valid sequence of compositions. If P is performed first, then S cannot be performed fourth, which is not allowed. If R is performed first, then O cannot be performed fifth, which is not allowed.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - T can be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R
  - At least two compositions are performed between F and R
  - O is performed either first or fifth
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H
  - P is performed at some time before S
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, we can infer that compositions O and P cannot be performed first or second. Since O has to be performed either first or fifth, it follows that P must be performed third. This means that T must be performed immediately after F. The eighth composition performed is either L or H, so we cannot determine which one is performed last. 

Analysis: 
  - If O is performed first, then R must be performed sixth and H must be performed last. This is not a valid choice because there are no compositions that can be performed second and third.
  - If O is performed fifth, then F must be performed second and R must be performed sixth. This is also not a valid choice because there are no compositions that can be performed first and third.
  - If P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth and R must be performed sixth. This is not a valid choice because T must be performed immediately after F.
  - If P is performed second, then O must be performed first and R must be performed sixth. This is not a valid choice because there are no compositions that can be performed third.
  - If P is performed third, then O can be performed either first or fifth. Let's assume O is performed first. Then F must be performed second and R must be performed sixth. This leaves compositions H and L to be performed seventh and eighth. This is a valid choice. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the compositions performed must satisfy the following conditions:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, the possible compositions that could be performed first, second, and third are limited to O, L, H, R, and T.
  
Analysis:
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed at some time before S. If S is performed fourth, then it means that O is performed first and P is performed second or third. From the choices given, we can eliminate A because P cannot be performed second or third if F is performed first. We can also eliminate B and E because H cannot be performed first. We are left with C and D. If O is performed first, then R must be performed second, and P must be performed third. Therefore, the only possible list of the compositions performed first, second, and third is O, R, P, which is in choice D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The order of performance of eight compositions is to be determined based on certain conditions.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions can be determined based on the given conditions.
  
  A: F, H, P - If F is performed after S, then it is not possible to perform H and P before R. So, this option is not possible.
  B: H, P. L - If S is performed fourth, then the only option before S is O. So, L cannot be performed as the eighth composition. So, this option is not possible.
  C: O, P, R - If S is performed fourth, then the only option before S is O. So, this is a possible option.
  D: O, P, T - If S is performed fourth, then the only option before S is O. If T is performed immediately after S, then it is not possible to perform F or R immediately before or after T. So, this option is not possible.
  E: P, R, T - If S is performed fourth, then the only option before S is O. So, it is not possible to perform P before S. So, this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C") - O, P, R
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The order of performance of the compositions must satisfy several conditions, including:
    - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
    - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
    - O is performed either first or fifth.
    - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
    - P is performed at some time before S.
    - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  - If S is performed fourth, then we know that O cannot be performed fourth (since O must be performed either first or fifth), and S cannot be performed first, second, or third (since P must be performed at some time before S). 

Analysis:
  - From the given choices, only Options C and D satisfy the given conditions. 
  - Option C: O is performed first, and P is performed second, which satisfies the condition that O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed before S. R must be performed third, which satisfies the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
  - Option D: O is performed first, and P is performed second, which satisfies the condition that O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed before S. T must be performed third, which satisfies the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.

Action: Answer("C or D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The compositions that must be performed consecutively are: F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then P must be performed before S. Therefore, O cannot be performed first, and it must be performed fifth. 
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H. If P is performed before S, then the eighth composition cannot be L because L must be performed last. Therefore, the eighth composition must be H. 
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. If S is performed fourth, and H is performed eighth, then F must be performed first. 
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. If F is performed first, then T must be performed immediately after R. 
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  - S is performed fourth.
  
  A: F is performed first, and P is performed third. But there is no way to place H as the eighth composition, as it should be either before P or after S.
  B: H is not the eighth composition, and L cannot be performed after P, so this option is not valid.
  C: O is performed first, and R is performed third. This satisfies the conditions that O is performed either first or fifth, and that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. This option can be valid.
  D: O is performed first, and T is performed third. This satisfies the condition that O is performed either first or fifth, and that T is performed immediately after R. This option can be valid.
  E: P is performed first, and R is performed second. But there is no way to place O as either the fifth or the first composition. 
  
Answer: Answer("C") or Answer("D") could be valid, but we cannot determine which one is correct based on the given information.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions to be performed after S are O, ?, ?, R, F (because there must be at least 2 compositions performed after F and before R, or after R and before F).
  
  Also, P must be performed before S, and the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  
  A: F, H, P - This list does not satisfy any of the conditions.
  B: H, P. L - This list does not satisfy any of the conditions.
  C: O, P, R - This list satisfies the conditions, because O is performed first, P is performed before S (which is performed fourth), and R is performed after S and before F or before S and after F.
  D: O, P, T - This list does not satisfy the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  E: P, R, T - This list does not satisfy the condition that O is performed either first or fifth.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  3. O is performed either first or fifth.
  4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  5. P is performed at some time before S.
  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
Since S is performed fourth, the compositions performed before S must be O, a composition between O and S, P, and a composition between P and S. Therefore, the possible accurate lists of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, are:
  - O, a composition between O and S, P
  - P, a composition between P and S, O
  - O, P, a composition between O and S
  - P, O, a composition between P and S
  
Checking the options:
  A: F, H, P -> P is performed before S, but S cannot be performed fourth because at least two compositions must be performed between F and R or between R and F.
  B: H, P, L -> P is performed before S, but S cannot be performed fourth because at least two compositions must be performed between F and R or between R and F.
  C: O, P, R -> O is performed first, which is a valid possibility.
  D: O, P, T -> O is performed first, which is a valid possibility. Also, T can be performed immediately after P since P is performed before S, and S is performed fourth.
  E: P, R, T -> P is performed before S, but S cannot be performed fourth because at least two compositions must be performed between F and R or between R and F.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds either fuel or produce.
  Bay 6 holds either livestock or grain.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Analysis: 
  We know that bay 6 holds either livestock or grain, and the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, bay 4 cannot hold livestock or grain, and by the same reasoning, bay 1 cannot hold produce or fuel. From the rule that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, we know that bay 1 cannot hold produce, so it must hold fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so bay 3 holds textiles, and bay 2 holds produce. Therefore, bay 4 must hold either grain, livestock, machinery, or textiles. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Bay 1 holds either fuel or produce.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - Bay 6 holds either textiles or machinery.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - Bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - Bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  
  We don't know anything yet about the type of cargo held in Bay 4.
  
  A: Grain must be in a bay with a higher number than the bay holding livestock. So, it cannot be in Bay 4. 
  B: Livestock must be in a bay with a lower number than the bay holding grain. So, it cannot be in Bay 4.
  C: Machinery can be held in any of the remaining bays, so it could be in Bay 4.
  D: Produce must be in a bay with a higher number than the bay holding fuel. So, it cannot be in Bay 4.
  E: Textiles must be in a bay either next to or in Bay 6. So, it cannot be in Bay 4.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay holding grain has a number higher than the bay holding livestock.
  Bay holding livestock has a number higher than the bay holding textiles.
  Bay holding produce has a number higher than the bay holding fuel.
  Bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Bay 4 is located between Bay 3 and Bay 5.
  Each of the six types of cargo is held in exactly one of the six bays.
  A: There is no bay with a number higher than the bay holding grain, so bay 6 cannot hold grain.
  B: There is no bay with a number lower than the bay holding livestock, so bay 1 cannot hold livestock.
  C: There is no rule that restricts which bay can hold machinery, so machinery can be held in any of the six bays, including bay 4.
  D: There is no rule that restricts which bay can hold produce. The bay holding produce has a number higher than the bay holding fuel, so produce cannot be in Bay 1 or Bay 2. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles cannot be in Bay 3 or Bay 6. Since Bay 1 cannot have livestock and Bay 6 cannot have grain, the only bays left for produce are Bay 4 and Bay 5. Therefore, produce can be held in bay 4.
  E: There is no rule that restricts which bay can hold textiles. The bay holding textiles has a number higher than the bay holding livestock, so textiles cannot be in Bay 1 or Bay 2. The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding textiles, so textiles cannot be in Bay 3 or Bay 6. Since Bay 1 cannot have livestock and Bay 6 cannot have grain, the only bays left for textiles are Bay 4 and Bay 5. Therefore, textiles can be held in bay 4.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six bays, numbered consecutively from 1 to 6.
  - There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  - Bay 1, 2, and 3 each have a neighboring bay with a higher number, so they cannot hold produce or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain cannot be in bay 6 because it has to be in a higher numbered bay than the bay holding livestock.
  - From the information that textiles is next to produce, bay 3 cannot hold textiles because it doesn't have a neighboring bay with a lower number.
  - Machinery has not been specifically placed so it could be in bay 4.
  - Therefore, the cargo that CANNOT be held in bay 4 is either grain, livestock, produce, or textiles.
  - Grain cannot be held in bay 4 because it has to be in a higher numbered bay than the bay holding livestock.
  - Livestock cannot be held in bay 4 because it has to be in a lower numbered bay than the bay holding grain and textiles.
  - Produce and textiles cannot be held in bay 4 because they have to be in a higher numbered bay than the bay holding fuel.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  - Each of the six types of cargo is held in exactly one bay.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - Bay 4 is not mentioned in any of the rules.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  From the rules, we know that the bay holding livestock is not in bay 4. Thus, we can eliminate option B. 
  We also know that textiles is next to produce. If textiles is in bay 3, then produce must be in bay 4, and that would make option D incorrect. 
  If textiles is in bay 5, then produce must be in bay 4, and that would make option D incorrect. 
  Therefore, we are left with the following possible arrangements:
    Bay 3: textiles, Bay 4: machinery
    Bay 3: textiles, Bay 4: grain
    Bay 5: textiles, Bay 4: machinery
    Bay 5: textiles, Bay 4: grain
  Machinery and grain are both possible cargos for bay 4. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Thus, the bay holding textiles is either in Bay 3 or Bay 5.
  The bay holding produce must be in Bay 5 (because it is higher than fuel)
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so it must be in Bay 3.
  The bay holding livestock must be in Bay 2 (because it is higher than textiles).
  The bay holding grain must be in Bay 4 (because it is higher than livestock).
  Therefore, the type of cargo held in Bay 4 cannot be livestock, produce, textiles, or grain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 contains either fuel or produce.
  Bay 2 contains either fuel or produce.
  Bay 3 contains either grain or livestock.
  Bay 4 contains one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 5 contains either textiles or produce.
  Bay 6 contains either livestock or machinery.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  Bay 4 cannot hold grain because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. If Bay 4 held grain, then Bay 3 would have to hold livestock, but that would violate the condition that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Bay 4 cannot hold livestock because Bay 3 holds either grain or livestock.
  Bay 4 cannot hold produce because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel and Bay 1 and Bay 2 can only hold fuel or produce.
  Bay 4 cannot hold textiles because the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, and Bay 5 can only hold either textiles or produce.
Action: Answer("C")

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo, bay 2 holds another type, and so on until bay 6.
  Bay 6 holds one of the six types of cargo, bay 5 holds another type, and so on until bay 1.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so livestock cannot be in bay 6.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so textiles cannot be in bay 5.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so fuel cannot be in bay 3.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles and produce cannot be in bays 4 and 5.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students displaying two paintings each, one oil and one watercolor.
  2. There are four walls (1, 2, 3, and 4) with two paintings each, one in the upper and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Solution: 
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then there are two possibilities:
  1. Greene's oil is in the upper position of the wall, and Franz's watercolor is in the lower position of the same wall.
  2. Franz's watercolor is in the upper position of the wall, and Greene's oil is in the lower position of the same wall.
  However, from the given conditions, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, the second possibility is not valid. Hence, the only valid possibility is that Greene's oil is displayed in the upper position of the wall, and Franz's watercolor is displayed in the lower position of the same wall. Now, we can use the given conditions to determine which one of the options is true.
  A: We cannot determine whether Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position or a lower position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor may or may not be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. This statement is not necessarily true.
  C: We cannot determine whether Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position or a lower position.
  D: Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  E: From the given condition, we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students who will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than Franz's oil. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then Franz's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of that wall. This means that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. So, the correct answer is C, "Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position."
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Each of the four walls displays exactly two paintings.
- No wall has only watercolors.
- No wall has the work of only one student.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the following must be true:
- Greene's watercolor is displayed on another wall.
- Isaacs's oil is not on the same wall as Franz's watercolor because no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
- Hidalgo must have both an oil and a watercolor displayed.
- Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor because no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
- Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position on the wall with Franz's watercolor, as no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Thus, Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 4 students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  - They each display 2 paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  - Each wall has exactly 2 paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then that wall must be either wall 1 or wall 2, since we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil. This means that wall 3 and wall 4 must each have at least one oil painting on them. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, this means that at least one of the oil paintings on wall 3 or wall 4 must be displayed in an upper position. Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, this means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position on wall 3. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, so the answer is C.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Four art students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will each display exactly two paintings - an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room - walls 1, 2, 3, and 4 - with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")
Explanation: 
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of that wall. This means that Franz's oil will be displayed in the lower position of that wall. 
  Based on the given conditions, no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, and no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on different walls than Franz's and Isaacs's paintings.
  So, the only possibility is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students displaying two paintings each.
  - There are four walls (1, 2, 3, and 4) with two paintings on each wall.
  - There can't be a wall with only watercolors or only one student's work.
  - Wall with Franz's oil has Greene's watercolor in the upper position.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
To find the answer, we need to consider the given information and try to deduce a conclusion. 
If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the only wall left for Hidalgo's two paintings is wall 3. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be on wall 3. Also, Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be on either wall 1 or wall 2. Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, Isaacs's watercolor must be on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. Thus, we can conclude that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Each wall has 1 oil painting and 1 watercolor painting.
  - Franz and Isaacs cannot be on the same wall.
  - Greene's watercolor is on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  - Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4.
  - No wall has only watercolors.
  - No wall has the work of only one student.
  
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor:
  - Greene's watercolor must be in the lower position of that wall.
  - Franz's oil must be in the upper position of that wall.
  - Hidalgo's paintings must be on a different wall from Isaacs's paintings.
  - Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor because it would violate the "No wall has only watercolors" rule.
  
Analysis:
  - A cannot be true because Greene's oil is not on the same wall as his watercolor.
  - B cannot be true because Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  - C cannot be true because Hidalgo cannot have both paintings on the same wall.
  - D cannot be true because Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  - E must be true because Isaacs's watercolor cannot be in the lower position of wall 4 because his oil is already there and no wall can have only watercolors.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are four walls numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  Each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  Each of the four students will display exactly two paintings - one oil and one watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the only wall that can happen is wall 3. According to the rules, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, and since Greene's oil is on wall 3, then Franz's oil is on wall 3 and his watercolor is on a different wall. No wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, so Hidalgo's two paintings must be displayed on walls 1, 2, or 4. Since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, Isaacs's two paintings cannot be displayed on wall 3. Consequently, Isaacs's two paintings must be displayed on walls 1, 2, or 4. Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, then Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of one of the other walls. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. Answer("C").
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are 4 walls, each with one upper and one lower position.
  Each student displays exactly two paintings: one oil and one watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

To solve the problem, we need to use the given information to determine the possible locations of the paintings and see which answer choice must be true if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor.

Possible locations for Franz's paintings are walls 1, 2, and 3. If Franz's oil and watercolor are displayed on different walls, then the wall with Franz's watercolor must have a painting by either Greene or Hidalgo in its upper position, since Greene's watercolor is already in use. This means that if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then it must be on wall 4. In this case, Isaacs's oil is also on wall 4, but in the lower position.

Now we can check which answer choice must be true:
A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. - Not necessarily true, since it could be in the lower position.
B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. - Not necessarily true, since we don't know the location of Hidalgo's paintings.
C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. - Not necessarily true, since we don't know the location of Hidalgo's paintings.
D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. - Not necessarily true, since we don't know the location of Hidalgo's paintings.
E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position. - This must be true, since we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4 and each student has one oil and one watercolor. Therefore, Answer("E") is the correct answer.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the wall with Franz's watercolor must have Greene's watercolor in the upper position.
  - The only student left to be displayed on that wall is Hidalgo.
  - No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so Isaacs's paintings cannot be on the same wall as Franz's paintings.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be in the upper position of wall 2.
  - Hidalgo's oil must be on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, so Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. Therefore, choice D is the correct answer.

  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the order must be O-S-_-_-_-_- or -_-_-_-_-S-O, where O denotes optometrist and S denotes shoe store.
  
Analysis:
  Since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, we have two possible arrangements: O-S-_-_-_-_- or -_-_-_-_-S-O. 
  If we consider the first arrangement O-S-_-_-_-_-:
    - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. So, the pharmacy must be in the first or last position.
    - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since one restaurant must be at the other end of the row, the other restaurant must be in the middle. Therefore, the two restaurants must be in positions 1 and 5, or 3 and 7.
    - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. So, the toy store must be in positions 2, 4, or 6.
    - The businesses immediately on either side of the O-S pair must be P and R, or R and P, where P denotes pharmacy and R denotes restaurant.
    - So, the possible arrangements are:
      - O-S-P-R-T-V-R
      - R-V-T-R-P-S-O
  If we consider the second arrangement -_-_-_-_-S-O:
    - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. So, the pharmacy must be in the first or last position.
    - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since one restaurant must be at the other end of the row, the other restaurant must be in the middle. Therefore, the two restaurants must be in positions 1 and 5, or 3 and 7.
    - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. So, the toy store must be in positions 2, 4, or 6.
    - The businesses immediately on either side of the O-S pair must be P and R, or R and P, where P denotes pharmacy and R denotes restaurant.
    - So, the possible arrangements are:
      - P-R-T-V-R-S-O
      - R-V-T-R-P-S-O
      
Action: Answer("A")  
Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the O-S pair must be the pharmacy and a restaurant. (Option A)
Response 1:

  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the six businesses that are not the optometrist must be arranged in one of the following two orders: Pharmacy-Restaurant-Restaurant-Veterinarian-Toy Store or Toy Store-Veterinarian-Pharmacy-Restaurant-Restaurant.
  In either case, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the veterinarian.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The shopping center has exactly seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be a pharmacy and either the veterinarian or a restaurant.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the order of businesses in the row is as follows: Shoe store, Optometrist, (Pharmacy or Veterinarian), Restaurant, Business X, Business Y, Restaurant.

Analysis:
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the order of businesses in the row is as follows: Shoe store, Optometrist, (Pharmacy or Veterinarian), Restaurant, Business X, Business Y, Restaurant.
- The pharmacy or veterinarian must be next to the optometrist, so the order is either Optometrist, Pharmacy, Restaurant, Business X, Business Y, Restaurant, Shoe store or Optometrist, Veterinarian, Restaurant, Business X, Business Y, Restaurant, Shoe store.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so Business X and Business Y must be between the two restaurants.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be either Business X or Business Y.
- Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the shoe store and optometrist are Pharmacy and Restaurant, or Veterinarian and Restaurant.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 spaces in the row, and 7 businesses to be located in the row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, we can infer that the order is (from left to right): [pharmacy], [optometrist, shoe store], [_ _ _], [restaurant], [_ _ _], [toy store], [restaurant/veterinarian].
 
Analysis:
  - The optometrist is next to the shoe store, so the two empty spaces must be filled by other businesses. 
  - The pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  - One of the restaurants must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the second restaurant cannot be in spaces 2 or 6.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian must be in space 7.
  - Therefore, the order is: [pharmacy], [optometrist, shoe store], [restaurant], [_ _ _], [restaurant], [_ _ _], [toy store], [veterinarian]. The businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and a restaurant.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The optometrist is next to the shoe store.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian and not next to the toy store.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

We don't know where the veterinarian is located. However, since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, we can infer that the pharmacy is also next to the optometrist. Therefore, the pharmacy must be located at one end of the row, so it must be in either space 1 or space 7. If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6. If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the veterinarian must be in space 6 or space 2. In any case, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 4 or space 5. 

So, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the veterinarian. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses and the pharmacy and the veterinarian are already placed, the two restaurants must be in spaces 3 and 7 (if the pharmacy is in space 1) or spaces 1 and 5 (if the pharmacy is in space 7). Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("E") 
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  A shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a straight row and seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the order of the businesses from left to right is as follows: [optometrist, shoe store, ___, ___, ___, ___, pharmacy or restaurant]
  
Analysis:
  Since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the order of the businesses from left to right is as follows: [optometrist, shoe store, ___, ___, ___, ___, pharmacy or restaurant]. 
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy can only occupy spaces 2 or 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the veterinarian cannot occupy spaces 3 or 5.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot occupy spaces 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  
Conclusion:
  The only possibility for the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair is the pharmacy and the restaurant. Therefore, the answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.

  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be one of the following three cases:
    1- Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store
    2- Pharmacy - Optometrist - Toy Store
    3- Toy Store - Shoe Store - Veterinarian
    
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are seven spaces in the shopping center arranged in a straight row
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then they must be in one of the middle five spaces

Analysis:
  Since the optometrist must be next to the shoe store and is in one of the middle five spaces, then the pharmacy must be at one of the two ends, and one of the restaurants must be at the other end. Therefore, the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the only possibility is that the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the veterinarian.

  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. - This is not possible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are three types of cookie: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches are made for each type of cookie.
  Each batch is made on a different day of the week.
  No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second oatmeal batch is made on the same day as the first peanut butter batch.
  The second sugar batch is made on Thursday.
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are a total of nine batches of cookies for the week. 

Analysis:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are a total of nine batches of cookies for the week, which means that there are three batches of cookies made on Friday. 
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first and third batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday. 
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Wednesday because the second oatmeal batch is made on the same day as the first peanut butter batch.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday because the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on one of those days.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Friday because there is only one batch of cookies made on Friday.

Solution:
  Based on the analysis above,
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Tuesday, but it cannot be the first batch because the first batch must be made on Monday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because there are three batches of cookies made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Wednesday.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Response 2:

  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there must be a total of 8 batches made from Monday to Friday.

Analysis:
  We know that 2 batches of cookies will be made on Thursday, which means that all 3 kinds of cookies will be made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday (Choice A). The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday (Choice B) because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on that day. The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday (Choice C) because there are only 3 batches of each kind of cookie, and 2 batches of oatmeal cookies have already been made earlier in the week. The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday (Choice D) because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, and all 3 kinds of cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, the only possible choice is E, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.

  - Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  - Since exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, there can't be any more sugar cookies made on other days. 
  - We also know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - Therefore, the first and second batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.
  - We already know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so it must be the first batch of sugar cookies that is made on Monday.
  - We also know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - From the conditions, we can see that the first batch of peanut butter cookies can only be made on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.

Knowledge: 
  There are five movies showing on three different screens at specific times.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, with one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.

  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis: 
  We are asked to identify a list of movies that CANNOT be shown on screen 2. 
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so any list that includes the romance is incorrect. 
  The western cannot be shown on screen 2 because it is shown before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film can be shown on screen 2 as long as it is paired with either the horror film or the mystery. 
  Therefore, the only option that CANNOT be shown on screen 2 is the one that includes the western and the romance.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a row in the shopping center and each space will have one business.
  - The pharmacy and one restaurant must be at opposite ends of the row.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and the shoe store is in space 4. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or 7. It must be in either space 2 or 6, and it must be next to either the optometrist or veterinarian.
  - Because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, there are only two possible arrangements for the restaurants: R_ _ R _ _ _ or _ _ _ R _ R. In either case, the restaurant that is not at the end of the row must be next to the shoe store.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in one of the spaces 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
The only option that must be true is that a restaurant is next to the toy store.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The pharmacy and a restaurant must be located at opposite ends of the row.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the pharmacy and a restaurant must be located at opposite ends of the row, the only possible locations for them are spaces 1 and 7.
  - Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian and cannot be next to the restaurant, the only possible location for the pharmacy is space 1 and the only possible location for the optometrist or veterinarian is space 2.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses and the pharmacy is in space 1, the only possible location for the other restaurant is space 5.
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the only possible location for the toy store is space 6.
  - Therefore, the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 3 and the shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, if the shoe store is in space 4, it must be true that a restaurant is next to the toy store.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 spaces in a straight row in the shopping center.
  - There are 7 businesses: optometrist, a pharmacy, 2 restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: Since the shoe store is in space 4, we know that the pharmacy cannot be in either space 1 or space 7. Thus, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it must be next to the optometrist. This means that the optometrist must be in space 3 or space 5. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, we know that the restaurants cannot be in spaces 1 and 2 or spaces 6 and 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7, and it must be next to the veterinarian. This means that the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it must be in space 3. Therefore, a restaurant must be in space 7 and the other restaurant must be in space 1. Thus, none of the choices A, C, D or E can be true, but the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian as stated in choice B.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 spaces in a straight row, numbered 1 through 7.
  - 7 businesses will be located in the shopping center: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then:
  - Space 3 must be occupied by either a restaurant, the optometrist, or the veterinarian.
  - Space 5 cannot be occupied by the veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy cannot be in space 4 or space 5 because it must be at one end of the row.
  
  A: It is not necessarily true based on the given constraints.
  B: It is possible based on the given constraints, but not necessarily true.
  C: It is not necessarily true based on the given constraints.
  D: It is not true because the toy store cannot be next to the shoe store.
  E: It is not possible based on the given constraints because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian and cannot be in space 4 or 5.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:

  - There are seven businesses that will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the shoe store is in space 4, we can conclude that the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 1 and 7.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it should be in space 1 or 7, and one of the restaurants should be in the other end.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, we can conclude that the restaurant at the other end should be at least two spaces away from the pharmacy. Therefore, the pharmacy should be in space 1 and the other restaurant should be in space 7.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 3 or space 5.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:

  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.

Analysis:
  - We know that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and the shoe store is not at either end, so the pharmacy cannot be next to the shoe store.
  - We also know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
  - The optometrist and veterinarian are the only two businesses that can be next to the pharmacy, so one of them must be in space 2 or space 6.
  - The two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in space 2 and space 3 or in space 5 and space 6.

Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, if the shoe store is in space 4, then the only option that must be true is that a restaurant is next to the toy store.

  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: Since the shoe store is in space 4, it must be the case that the pharmacy is either in space 1 or space 7. According to the constraint, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 3 or space 5. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 5. This means the pharmacy is in space 7 and the optometrist must be in space 6. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they must be in spaces 2 and 5. Therefore, the shoe store is not next to the toy store, and it is next to the veterinarian. Thus, the only option that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, which is option B.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - There are seven businesses: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.

  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - If the shoe store is in space 4, it means there are three businesses to the left of it and three to the right of it.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be next to the shoe store.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist.
  - This means that the veterinarian must be at the other end of the row, next to the restaurant.
  - Therefore, the shoe store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the only statement that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Answer: B
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces (1-7) arranged in a straight row.
  - Each space will have exactly one of the seven businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.

Analysis:
  - We don't know the exact locations of the other businesses yet, but we can infer some information based on the given constraints.
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it cannot be next to the shoe store in space 4.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - If the pharmacy is next to the optometrist, then the veterinarian must be in either space 2 or space 7.
  - If the veterinarian is in space 2, then the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 5, which means it must be in space 6.
  - If the veterinarian is in space 7, then the toy store cannot be in space 6, which means it must be in space 3 or space 5.
  - In either case, the shoe store is not next to the toy store, which eliminates choices C and D.
  - If the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, then the optometrist must be in either space 2 or space 7.
  - If the optometrist is in space 2, then the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 5, which means it must be in space 6.
  - If the optometrist is in space 7, then the toy store cannot be in space 6, which means it must be in space 3 or space 5.
  - In either case, the shoe store is not next to the veterinarian, which eliminates choice E.
  - Therefore, the only possible option is A, meaning the optometrist must be next to a restaurant.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 spaces in a straight row in the shopping center.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.

  - The shoe store is in space 4.
Analysis: 
  - Since the shoe store is in space 4, the toy store cannot be next to it or to the veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it cannot be next to the shoe store, which means it must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 2 and 3 or in spaces 5 and 6.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We are looking for a pair of colors that cannot appear together as solid rugs if there are exactly two solid rugs. 
  The six colors are forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  In any solid rug where white is used, two other colors are also used. 
  There are exactly five colors used to weave the rugs.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. 
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis: 
  - If forest is a solid rug, then it must be paired with two other colors because white cannot be used alone. However, this means there will be three solid rugs. Therefore, A is possible.
  - If yellow is a solid rug, then it must be paired with two other colors because white cannot be used alone. However, this means there will be three solid rugs. Therefore, B is possible.
  - If peach is a solid rug, then it cannot be paired with turquoise or yellow, which means there will be only one color to pair with olive in the other solid rug. However, this is impossible because five colors must be used to weave the rugs. Therefore, C is not possible.
  - If turquoise is a solid rug, then it cannot be paired with peach or yellow, which means there will be only one color to pair with forest in the other solid rug. However, this is impossible because five colors must be used to weave the rugs. Therefore, D is not possible.
  - If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the remaining solid rug must be white paired with two other colors. If one of those colors is peach, then the other color cannot be turquoise. Therefore, E is not possible.

Action: Answer("E")

    Option C: peach and turquoise - There is no rule that prevents peach and turquoise from being used together in a solid rug.
    Option D: peach and yellow - There is a rule that peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, they cannot be used together in a solid rug.
    Option E: turquoise and yellow - There is no rule that prevents turquoise and yellow from being used together in a solid rug.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We are looking for two colors that cannot be used in solid rugs.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Elimination:
  If we assume that forest and peach or forest and yellow are used in solid rugs, then the third color must be used in the multicolored rug with white. Then, olive and peach must be used in the same multicolored rug, which is not allowed. Therefore, A and B are eliminated.
  If peach and turquoise or peach and yellow are used in solid rugs, then the third color must be used in the multicolored rug with white. Then, olive and peach must be used in the same multicolored rug, which is not allowed. Therefore, D and C are eliminated.
  If turquoise and yellow are used in solid rugs, then white must be used in the multicolored rug with two other colors. However, all the other colors that can be used with white have already been used in the other rugs. Therefore, E is eliminated.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored. 
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. 
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored. 
  Let's consider all possible cases and see which ones satisfy the given conditions:
  - If the multicolored rug contains forest, then it can't contain turquoise. Also, the other two colors in the rug can't be peach and yellow, because peach and yellow can't be used together in a rug. Therefore, the other two colors must be olive and white. However, this leaves us with only one solid rug that can be made, which is peach. This contradicts the given condition that there are exactly two solid rugs. Therefore, this case is not possible.
  - If the multicolored rug contains olive, then it must contain peach. Also, it can't contain turquoise, because peach and turquoise can't be used together in a rug. Therefore, the other color in the rug must be either forest or yellow. If it's forest, then the two solid rugs can be white and turquoise. If it's yellow, then the two solid rugs can be forest and turquoise. Therefore, this case is possible, and the colors of the two solid rugs can be:
    - forest and turquoise (because they can't be used together in a multicolored rug that contains olive)
    - white and peach (because white must be used with two other colors, and olive and peach must be used together in a rug)
  - If the multicolored rug contains peach, then it can't contain turquoise. Also, the other two colors in the rug can't be forest and yellow, because forest and turquoise can't be used together in a rug. Therefore, the other two colors must be olive and white. However, this leaves us with only one solid rug that can be made, which is forest. This contradicts the given condition that there are exactly two solid rugs. Therefore, this case is not possible.
  - If the multicolored rug contains turquoise, then it must contain forest. Also, it can't contain peach, because peach and turquoise can't be used together in a rug. Therefore, the other color in the rug must be either olive or yellow. If it's olive, then the two solid rugs can be white and peach. If it's yellow, then the two solid rugs can be forest and peach. Therefore, this case is possible, and the colors of the two solid rugs can be:
    - forest and peach (because they can't be used together in a multicolored rug that contains turquoise)
    - white and olive (because white must be used with two other colors, and olive and peach must be used together in a rug)
  
  Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the colors of the two solid rugs CANNOT be:
  A: forest and peach (because they can't be used together in a multicolored rug that contains olive)
  C: peach and turquoise (because they can't be used together in any rug)
  D: peach and yellow (because they can't be used together in a rug)
  
  Therefore, the answer is B: forest and yellow.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 6 colors available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly 5 of the colors will be used.
  Each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
  White must be used with two other colors in a rug.
  Olive must be used with peach in a rug.
  Forest and turquoise can't be used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise can't be used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow can't be used together in a rug.

If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the other rug must be multicolored and use all 5 colors. 

If Forest is used in a solid rug, then neither turquoise nor peach can be used in that rug, which means that peach must be used in the other solid rug. Therefore, we cannot have forest and peach as the colors of the two solid rugs.

If Yellow is used in a solid rug, then peach cannot be used in that rug, which means that olive and peach must be used in the other solid rug. Therefore, we cannot have forest and yellow as the colors of the two solid rugs.

If Turquoise is used in a solid rug, then peach cannot be used in that rug, which means that olive and peach must be used in the other solid rug. Therefore, we cannot have peach and turquoise as the colors of the two solid rugs.

If Peach is used in a solid rug, then olive must be used in the other solid rug, which means that neither forest nor turquoise can be used in either of the solid rugs. Therefore, we can have turquoise and yellow as the colors of the two solid rugs.

Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs CANNOT be:
Action: Answer("D") Peach and Yellow
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are six colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  Each color that is used will only be used in one of the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each rug must use exactly one of the six colors available.
  According to the given rules, forest and peach cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be used in the two solid rugs together. 
  Thus, the colors of those two rugs CANNOT be forest and yellow, peach and turquoise, peach and yellow, or turquoise and yellow.
  Therefore, the answer is B: forest and yellow.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We need to find the pair of colors that cannot form the solid rugs if there are exactly two solid rugs.
  The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Solution:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then all the colors used to make the solid rugs will also be used to make the multicolored rug. Since each color can be used only once, there are exactly three colors for the multicolored rug. White cannot be used in a solid rug, so it must be used in the multicolored rug, and two other colors must be used with it. We have five colors, and we can pick any two colors to make a solid rug. Therefore, we have 5C2=10 possibilities to choose two colors for the solid rugs. We can try each of the 10 possibilities and see if it violates any of the given conditions. If it does, we eliminate that possibility. If it does not, we keep that possibility. 
  Here are the possibilities:
  1. forest and olive
  2. forest and peach
  3. forest and turquoise
  4. forest and white
  5. forest and yellow
  6. olive and peach
  7. olive and turquoise
  8. olive and white
  9. olive and yellow
  10. peach and white
  
  Eliminating the possibilities that violate the conditions, we get the following:
  2. forest and peach (because of the condition that peach cannot be used with turquoise)
  3. forest and turquoise (because of the condition that forest and turquoise cannot be used together)
  10. peach and white (because of the condition that white must be used with two other colors)
  
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and peach, forest and turquoise, or peach and white.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  We need to identify two solid rugs.
  For a solid rug, only one color will be used to weave it.
  There are six available colors and five colors will be used in total to weave the rugs.
  We need to identify two colors that cannot be used together in the same rug.
  The rules state that forest and turquoise, peach and turquoise, and peach and yellow should not be used together in any rug.
  
  A: forest and peach can be used in the same rug, as they are not mutually exclusive.
  B: forest and yellow can be used in the same rug, as they are not mutually exclusive.
  C: peach and turquoise cannot be used in the same rug, as per the rules.
  D: peach and yellow cannot be used in the same rug, as per the rules.
  E: turquoise and yellow can be used in the same rug, as they are not mutually exclusive.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find the pair of colors that cannot be used together in the two solid rugs.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, the remaining one must be multi-colored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Elimination: 
  Let us check each option:
  A: forest and peach - These two colors can be used in the same rug but cannot be used in a multi-colored rug because we need two more colors with white.
  B: forest and yellow - These two colors can be used in the same rug but cannot be used in a multi-colored rug because we need two more colors with white.
  C: peach and turquoise - These two colors cannot be used together in any rug.
  D: peach and yellow - These two colors cannot be used together in any rug.
  E: turquoise and yellow - These two colors can be used in the same rug but cannot be used in a multi-colored rug because we need two more colors with white.

Action: Answer("C") - Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in any rug, so options C is the correct answer.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are six colors of thread available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of these colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then one of them must be a white rug, and the other must be a non-white solid rug.
  According to the rules, if white is used in a rug, two other colors must also be used in that rug. Therefore, the non-white solid rug must be woven using only one of the remaining colors (forest, olive, peach, turquoise, or yellow).
  From the rules, we know that forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, if the non-white solid rug is forest or turquoise, the other colors used in that rug must be among olive, peach, and yellow.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, the non-white solid rug cannot be peach or turquoise.
  We are left with forest and yellow as the only two options for the non-white solid rug. Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs CANNOT be forest and yellow.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: Verma could be the project leader if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  To select the project team, three workers will be selected, and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, neither Wells nor Ruiz could be project members, so Smith and Taylor would have to be the other two project members. This means that either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. Therefore, we need to find an answer choice in which neither Quinn nor Ruiz is selected, but one of them is still the project leader.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three workers, and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. - If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which implies that Taylor cannot be a project member. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader.
  
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. - If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which implies that no one can be the project leader since Taylor must be a project member if Smith is a project member. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader.
  
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. - If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Wells can be a project member. Since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is a project member, the only remaining candidates for the project members are Quinn, Xue, and Wells. Since Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project, we know that neither of them can be a project member. Therefore, the project members are Wells, Xue, and Smith (since Taylor cannot be a project member if Smith is not a project member). In this case, Verma can be the project leader since none of the project members are Quinn or Ruiz.
  
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. - If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Taylor must be a project member (since Smith must be a project member if Taylor is a project member). If Taylor is a project member, then Wells cannot be a project member. Therefore, the only remaining candidates for the project members are Quinn, Ruiz, and Taylor. Since Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project, we know that one of them must be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader.
  
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. - If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then either Ruiz or Verma must be a project member (since neither of them can be a project member if Wells is a project member). If Verma is a project member, then she cannot be the project leader (since Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project). If Ruiz is a project member, then he must be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Verma could be the project leader if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the seven workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Process of Elimination:
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be a project member, which violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, A is not possible.
  B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Quinn or Smith must be the project leader, and if either Quinn or Ruiz is selected, they must be the project leader, which violates the constraint that Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, B is not possible.
  C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Wells cannot be a project member, which violates the constraint that if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, C is not possible.
  D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Taylor must be a project member, and if Taylor is a project member, then Smith must be a project member and be the project leader, which violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, D is not possible.
  E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, E is not possible.
Answer: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The project leader must be one of the three project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Elimination:
  Option A: Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, because if Smith is not selected, Taylor cannot be a project member, and hence, Smith cannot be the project leader, which means Verma cannot be the project leader.
  Option B: Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, because if Ruiz is not selected, Quinn cannot be a project member, and hence, Quinn cannot be the project leader, which means Verma cannot be the project leader.
  Option C: Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, because if Smith is not selected, Taylor cannot be a project member, which means Smith cannot be the project leader, which means Verma cannot be the project leader.
  Option D: Verma can be the project leader if neither Smith nor Xue is selected. However, this does not provide sufficient information to determine if Verma can be a project member.
  Option E: Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, because if Wells is not selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member, which means Wells cannot be the project leader, which means Verma cannot be the project leader.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three workers out of seven are to be selected.
  - Exactly one of the selected workers will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can only be selected if he leads the project.
  - If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be selected.
  - If Wells is selected, Ruiz and Verma cannot be selected.
  
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected - If Quinn is not selected, Ruiz cannot be selected. If Smith is not selected, then Taylor can be or cannot be selected. So, this option does not provide sufficient information about Verma's selection.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected - This option does not allow Ruiz to be the project leader because if Ruiz is selected, he must lead the project. Also, if Taylor is not selected, then Smith cannot be selected. Hence, Verma cannot be the project leader in this case.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected - If Smith is not selected, then Taylor can be or cannot be selected. If Taylor is not selected, then Smith cannot be selected. In either case, Wells can be a project member. However, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member because Wells is selected, so Verma cannot be the project leader.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected - This option does not provide sufficient information about Verma's selection.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected - If Taylor is not selected, then Smith cannot be selected. Hence, Wells cannot be selected. In such a case, either Quinn or Ruiz can be the project leader, and Verma can be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are exactly seven workers named Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  To determine if Verma could be the project leader, we need to find a scenario where Verma is one of the three project members and is selected as the project leader.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be selected if Verma is a project member. So, to have Verma as a project member, Wells cannot be selected.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, if Verma is a project member, either Smith and Taylor are both selected or neither of them is selected. So, to have Verma as a project member, either Smith and Taylor are both selected or neither of them is selected.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be selected as the project leader if they are selected as project members. So, if Quinn or Ruiz is selected as a project member, they must be selected as the project leader.
  
Solutions:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. - If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Verma can be a project member, but Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader. Incorrect.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. - If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Verma can be a project member. However, if Verma is a project member, then either Smith and Taylor are both selected or neither of them is selected. If Smith and Taylor are both selected, then Ruiz or Quinn must be the project leader, and Verma cannot be the project leader. If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader in this scenario. Incorrect.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. - If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma can be a project member. However, if Verma is a project member, then either Smith and Taylor are both selected or neither of them is selected. If Smith and Taylor are both selected, then Ruiz or Quinn must be the project leader, and Verma cannot be the project leader. If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader in this scenario. Incorrect.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. - If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Verma can be a project member. However, if Verma is a project member, then either Smith and Taylor are both selected or neither of them is selected. If Smith and Taylor are both selected, then Ruiz or Quinn must be the project leader, and Verma cannot be the project leader. If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader in this scenario. Incorrect.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. - If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Verma can be a project member. If Verma is a project member, then either Smith and Taylor are both selected or neither of them is selected. If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma can be the project leader. Therefore, if neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, Verma could be the project leader. Correct.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members.
- Exactly one of the three project members will be the project leader.
- Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
- If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
- If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Checking the choices:
A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected - If neither Quinn nor Ruiz is selected, then neither of them can be the project leader, which means Verma cannot be the project leader. This choice is not correct.
B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected - If Ruiz is not selected, then Quinn cannot be a project member, and if Taylor is not selected, then Smith cannot be a project member. This means that Wells will be a project member, which will make Verma ineligible to be the project leader. This choice is not correct.
C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected - If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then three of the remaining five workers will be selected. This means that Quinn or Ruiz can be the project leader, which makes Verma ineligible to be the project leader. This choice is not correct.
D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected - If Smith is not selected, then Taylor cannot be a project member. This means that three of the remaining six workers will be selected, and none of them will be Quinn or Ruiz since they can only be project members if they are the project leader. This means that Verma can be the project leader. This choice is correct.
E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected - If Wells is not selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be the project leader. If Taylor is not selected, then Smith cannot be a project member. This means that three of the remaining five workers will be selected, and none of them will be Quinn or Ruiz since they can only be project members if they are the project leader. This means that Verma can be the project leader. This choice is also correct.

Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Elimination:
  We are looking for a scenario where Verma could be the project leader. 
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be selected together or not at all.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, if Wells is selected, Verma cannot be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader.
  
Analysis:
  Let's go through the choices one by one.
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. 
    If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Ruiz must be the project leader. This violates the constraint that Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, this choice is not valid.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
    If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Verma, Wells, and either Quinn or Smith will be the project members. Since neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, Verma can be the project leader, satisfying the condition. Therefore, this choice is valid.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
    If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma, Wells, and either Quinn or Ruiz will be the project members. Since neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, Verma can be the project leader, satisfying the condition. Therefore, this choice is valid.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
    If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Verma, Wells, and either Quinn or Ruiz will be the project members. Since neither Smith nor Xue is selected, Verma can be the project leader, satisfying the condition. Therefore, this choice is valid.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
    If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Verma, Smith, and either Quinn or Ruiz will be the project members. Since Wells is not selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be the project leader. Therefore, this choice is not valid.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We are selecting three workers for a project and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be project members if they are leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
  In order for Verma to be the project leader, she must be selected as one of the three project members, and she must be selected as the project leader.
  
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, we can select Verma as one of the project members, but we cannot select her as the project leader because we have not selected Quinn or Ruiz. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, we can select Verma as one of the project members, and we can select her as the project leader because we have not selected Quinn or Ruiz. Therefore, B is true.
  C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, we cannot select Verma as one of the project members because Smith and Taylor must be selected together. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, we cannot select Verma as one of the project members because we need at least one of Smith or Taylor to be selected. Therefore, D is not true.
  E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, we can select Verma as one of the project members, but we cannot select her as the project leader because we have not selected Quinn or Ruiz. Therefore, E is not true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have exactly three workers and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Elimination: 
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, they cannot both be project members. 
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, if Verma is selected as the leader, Wells cannot be a project member. 
  If Verma is the project leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member. Therefore, if neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, Verma cannot be the project leader. 
  If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, it doesn't give us any information about whether Verma could be the project leader.
  If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then if Verma is the leader, either Wells or Smith must be a project member, but neither of them can be unless the other is also a project member.

Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  From the given rules, we can infer that J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Accordingly, we can conclude that K will be shown in the afternoon, and L will be shown either in the afternoon or evening, and M will be shown either in the afternoon or morning. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  
Analysis:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be the first or second house to be shown. Therefore, J must be the sixth or seventh house. 
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. 
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L cannot be the first or second house, and it cannot be the last house. Since K cannot be shown in the morning, L must be shown after K in the afternoon or evening. Since M must be shown after L, it must be the last house shown in the afternoon.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses (J, K, L, M, N, O, and P) during a single day. 
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.

  C: According to the rules, J must be shown in the evening, and L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, the only time L can be shown is in the afternoon. Hence, C must be true. 
  D: The rules state that J must be shown in the evening, and M must be shown after L is shown. M cannot be shown in the morning. Eliminate D.
  E: The rules state that J must be shown in the evening, and M must be shown after L is shown. The third, fourth, and fifth houses are shown in the afternoon, so M cannot be shown in the afternoon. Eliminate E.

  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Analysis:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, and that K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. L must be shown after K and before M, meaning that K, L, and M must be shown in the afternoon. This leaves N, O, and P to be shown in the morning.

Analysis:
  Since J is shown in the evening, it means that 6 other houses are shown before J is shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, therefore K must be shown either in the afternoon or evening.
  Since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, and there are only three houses to be shown in the afternoon, then L must be shown in the afternoon.
  This also means that M must be shown in the evening after L is shown.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
  Therefore, M is shown in the afternoon.

  - From rule 6, K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K must be shown in either the afternoon or the evening.
  - From rule 7, L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
    - If K is shown in the afternoon, then L can be shown in the afternoon or the evening, but M can only be shown in the evening.
    - If K is shown in the evening, then L can only be shown in the evening, but M can be shown in the afternoon or the evening.
  - Based on the rules, there is no way that M can be shown in the morning.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  
Analysis:
  From the given rules, we know that J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon and must be shown in the evening, but we do not know anything about the timing of K, L, M, N, 0, and P yet. 
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening, so M cannot be shown in the evening.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
  A: It is not necessarily true. There is no direct relationship between Jaramillo being assigned as ambassador to Venezuela and Kayne being assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  B: It is not necessarily true. There is no direct relationship between Kayne being assigned as ambassador to Yemen and Landon being assigned to Zambia.
  C: It is not necessarily true. Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Zambia if Landon is already assigned.
  D: It is not true. Jaramillo can be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela even if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  E: It is true. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, and Jaramillo is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Ong cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships because Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is assigned to one of them as well.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Elimination:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This eliminates choices A and D.
  If Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Ong is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This eliminates choice E.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Response 2:
Knowledge: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must be assigned to one too. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
  A: There is no information that directly links Jaramillo to Venezuela if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This choice cannot be determined from the given information.
  B: There is no information that links Landon's assignment to Zambia if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This choice cannot be determined from the given information.
  C: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. As a result, Ong could be assigned as ambassador to Zambia, but it is not a guarantee.
  D: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This means that Jaramillo could potentially be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, but it is not a guarantee.
  E: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. This does not provide any information about Ong's potential assignment as an ambassador. This choice cannot be determined from the given information.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
- Kayne or Novetzke should be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, but not both.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
- Kayne has been assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to an ambassadorship, and according to the second constraint, since Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned. This means that Kayne is assigned as either ambassador to Venezuela or Zambia, but since Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. As a result, Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, and must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Therefore, Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. The only true statement among the choices is that Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the three countries. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the three countries. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned to Venezuela, and Landon must be assigned to Zambia. This means that Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship. Thus, the only option that must be true is that Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia (choice B).
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned as ambassador to any of the countries.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to any of the countries, then Kayne is assigned as ambassador to that country as well.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned as ambassador, it is to Zambia.
  
  A: We cannot deduce this from the given information.
  B: We cannot deduce this from the given information.
  C: We cannot deduce this from the given information.
  D: We cannot deduce this from the given information.
  E: We can deduce this from the given information. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, and Landon is not assigned to any country, then the only remaining candidate who can be assigned as ambassador to Zambia is Ong.

Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen:
  - Novetzke is assigned to Venezuela or Zambia.
  - Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela.

If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to any country, then Kayne is also assigned as ambassador to some country. If Landon is assigned as ambassador to any country, it is to Zambia. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  
A: We cannot conclude anything about Jaramillo or Venezuela from this condition, as it is not related to Kayne being assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
B: We cannot conclude anything about Landon or Zambia from this condition, as it is not related to Kayne being assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
C: We cannot conclude anything about Ong or Zambia from this condition, as it is not related to Kayne being assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
D: We cannot conclude that Jaramillo is not assigned as ambassador to any country, as there is a possibility that Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela and Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
E: We cannot conclude that Ong is not assigned to any ambassadorship, as there is a possibility that Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to Yemen.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo is assigned to another ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo is assigned to another ambassadorship. However, we don't know which ambassadorship Jaramillo will be assigned to. We also know that if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Thus, choice B is the correct answer.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to the other country that is not Yemen or Venezuela. Therefore, Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Zambia since he is already assigned to Venezuela. Hence, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitar solo must be the first, second, or third.
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player. Therefore, the percussionist solo must be the first or the second.
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist. Therefore, the keyboard solo must be the second or the third.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  - The saxophonist can perform the third solo, as it would be after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist can perform either the second or third solo.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Six members of a band perform exactly one solo each during a concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The order of the solos is: percussionist, trumpeter, saxophonist, violinist, keyboard player, guitarist.
  - Therefore, whoever performs the third solo must be either the saxophonist or the violinist.
  - So, A, B, C, and D are all possible candidates for the third solo.
  - E, the violinist, cannot be the answer because the question asks which one cannot perform the third solo.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Each member of the six-member band performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  Since there are six members with each performing exactly one solo, and the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both, we can assume that the saxophonist must be performing either the fifth or the sixth solo. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, and the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist. Therefore, the keyboard solo must be the second or the third solo. The percussionist must perform before the keyboard player. Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the first or the second solo. The violinist must perform before the keyboard player. Therefore, the violinist must perform either the first or the second solo. 

Action: Answer("C") 
The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Thus, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band, each performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Process of elimination:
  - The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo. (eliminates A)
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player. (eliminates B)
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist does. (eliminates E)
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. (eliminates D)
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
Solution:
  We can start by reasoning about which members can perform the third solo based on the given information:
  - The guitarist cannot perform the 4th solo, so he must perform either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd solo.
  - The percussionist must perform before the keyboard player, so he must perform either the 1st or 2nd solo.
  - The keyboard player must perform after the violinist and before the guitarist, so he must perform either the 2nd or 3rd solo.
  - The saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both, so he must perform either the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th solo.
  - The trumpeter can perform either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd solo.
  - The violinist can perform either the 1st or 2nd solo.
  
  From the above information, we can see that the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the violinist, as he can only perform either the 1st or 2nd solo.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are six band members and each one performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who performs the third solo, we can use the restrictions given in the context. The possible options for the third solo are the saxophonist, the trumpet player, and the violinist. 

If the saxophonist performs the third solo, then we know that they perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. In this case, the only possible order for the first three solos is percussionist-saxophonist-trumpeter, but this would violate the restriction that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.

If the trumpet player performs the third solo, then we know that the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist does. In this case, the only possible order for the first three solos is percussionist-trumpeter-saxophonist. Now, the keyboard player must perform after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform fourth, which means that the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.

If the violinist performs the third solo, then we know that the saxophonist must perform after the trumpet player does. In this case, the only possible order for the first three solos is trumpet-violinist-saxophonist. Now, the keyboard player must perform after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform fourth, which means that the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Approach:
  We need to determine who can perform the third solo based on the given restrictions.
  From the restrictions, we can infer that the order of the solos can be: Percussionist, Trumpeter or Percussionist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, Violinist, Keyboard player.
  Therefore, the person who performs the third solo can be either the saxophonist or the trumpeter.
  
Action: Answer("A") - The guitarist cannot perform the third solo.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist nor the percussionist, since they have solo performances before the keyboard player.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the keyboard player, since they perform a solo after the violinist.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the saxophonist, since they perform a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  - The third solo cannot be performed by the violinist since they are not allowed to do so.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: 
  From the given information, we know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the possible order of performances is:
  1) percussionist, 2) Trumpeter or Saxophonist, 3) Saxophonist or Trumpeter, 4) any member except the guitarist, 5) Keyboard player, 6) Guitarist or Violinist.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, if the saxophonist performs the third solo, then the trumpeter must perform the second solo. But, from the given information, it is not clear if the trumpet player can perform the second solo. Hence, we can conclude that the Trumpeter CANNOT perform the third solo.
  Answer: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

To determine who could perform the third solo, we need to look at the order of solos and the restrictions that apply to each member.

If the saxophonist performs after the percussionist, then the possible order of solos is:
1. percussionist
2. saxophonist
3. ?
4. guitarist
5. keyboard player
6. violinist
If the saxophonist performs after the trumpeter, then the possible order of solos is:
1. trumpeter
2. saxophonist
3. ?
4. guitarist
5. keyboard player
6. violinist

The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. This means that the keyboard player cannot perform the third solo, because the violinist must perform before the keyboard player does.

Therefore, the answer is B: keyboard player.

Analysis: 
  Since the fifth audition must be recorded, we know that Kammer's audition is already over and Lugo's audition is the next one. Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, we know that Trillo's audition must be before the fifth audition. Also, we know that Zinn's audition must be before Yoshida's audition. Therefore, the order of the auditions must be: Kammer, Lugo, Waite, Trillo, Yoshida, and Zinn. So, the possible sixth audition is only Waite's audition.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The auditions are for six singers named Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Elimination: 
  We know that the fifth audition must be recorded and that the fourth audition cannot be recorded. We also know that Kammer's and Lugo's auditions will be recorded, so they must be the first and second auditions. 
  Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions, so Waite must audition third. 
  Kammer's audition must be before Trillo's audition, so Trillo must audition fifth. 
  Zinn's audition must be before Yoshida's, so Zinn must audition fourth. 
  Therefore, the only option left for the sixth audition is Lugo's audition. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The auditions must take place in the following order: Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida, Zinn.
  Kammer's and Lugo's auditions will be recorded.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  Therefore, the possible options for the sixth audition are Trillo and Waite, but Waite's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, which means Waite cannot be the sixth audition.
Action: Answer("C")

  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  - The order of the auditions is fixed.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the four non-recorded auditions.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  - Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions, so it must be the first, second, or third audition.
  - Kammer's audition must take place before Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be the first, second, or third audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place before Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be the first, second, third, or fourth audition.
  - Therefore, Trillo's audition must be the fifth audition.
  - The order of the six auditions is Zinn, Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida.
  - Therefore, the sixth audition could be Yoshida's audition.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")

  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so Waite's audition must be the fourth audition.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded, so Lugo's audition cannot be the sixth audition. 
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Trillo's audition must be the last audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Yoshida's audition must be earlier than or the same as the fifth audition.
  - Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be the first or second audition.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, Trillo's audition could be the sixth audition.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded.
  - The other four auditions will not be recorded.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analysis:
  - The first two auditions are Kammer's and Lugo's, in that order.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded, which means it must be either Trillo's, Waite's, Yoshida's, or Zinn's audition.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded, which means it must be either Trillo's, Yoshida's, or Zinn's audition.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, which means it must be either the first, second, or third audition.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, which means Trillo's audition must be either the fifth or sixth audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, which means Yoshida's audition must be either the fifth or sixth audition.

Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, Trillo's audition could be the sixth audition.

  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

To determine which one of the following could be the sixth audition, we need to find which auditions are already assigned and then consider the remaining options.

Analysis:
- From the given conditions, we know that Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition are in the first two slots, and Waite's audition is before the two recorded auditions, which means Waite's audition will be in the third slot. 
- Also, the fourth audition cannot be recorded, and we know that the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fifth audition must be the last recorded audition in the sixth slot. 
- We also know that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition and Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
- Therefore, we have the following sequence of auditions: 
  1. Kammer's audition (recorded)
  2. Lugo's audition (recorded)
  3. Waite's audition (not recorded)
  4. Trillo's audition (not recorded)
  5. Yoshida's audition (not recorded)
  6. Zinn's audition (recorded)
  
With this sequence, the only remaining option for the sixth audition is Trillo's audition.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 photographs, 2 per section. There are 3 sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photos must appear.
  - At least one photo in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photo in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photos in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photos can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon, since there must be at least one photograph by a photographer who also has a photograph in the Lifestyle section. However, none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, meaning that Gagnon must have two photographs in the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Choice B is correct.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Six photographs will appear in three sections, two photographs per section.
  - Three photographers (Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue) took the photographs.
  - Each photographer must have at least one photograph but no more than three photographs in total.
  - A photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - Gagnon's photographs cannot appear in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section, as Gagnon has none in the Sports section and Hue has one in the Lifestyle section. Since there are only two photographs in the Metro section, Fuentes can have at most one photograph in that section. Thus, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Therefore, choice B is the correct answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Each section should have exactly two photographs.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  - One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then we know that the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes because there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that there is only one photograph left that can be taken by Gagnon, which must go in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Hence, the correct answer is B.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 different photographs in total, 2 photographs per section on 3 sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, that means the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section is taken by Fuentes. There are two possibilities for the photographers in the Metro section: (1) Gagnon and Fuentes or (2) Hue and Fuentes. In the Sports section, there are two photographs taken by Fuentes and Hue.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear in total, exactly two photographs per section.
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then it follows that:
- The third photographer, Fuentes, must have both of his/her photographs in the Metro and Sports sections.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, so Fuentes must have one photograph in Sports.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so Hue must have the other photograph in Sports.
- Based on the above, exactly one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes.
- The remaining photograph in the Metro section must be by either Gagnon or Hue.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so the one photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper will have two photographs each, for a total of six photographs.
  The photographs were taken by three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each photographer must have at least one photograph, but no more than three photographs.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Analysis:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
    - The third photographer, Fuentes, must have at least one photograph in both the Metro and Sports sections, to satisfy the constraint that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and the constraint that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
    - Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Sports section, then Fuentes must have at least two photographs in the Sports section, and Hue must have at least two photographs in the Lifestyle section.
    - Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes, to satisfy the constraint that each photographer must have at least one photograph, but no more than three photographs.
    
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - A total of six different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
  - Each photographer must have at least one photograph, but no more than three photographs, in the newspaper.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - Number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle = Number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports.
  - Gagnon's photographs cannot be in the Sports section.

Action: 
  - If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then we can conclude that the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes (since each photographer must have at least one photograph in the newspaper).
  - Since at least one photograph in Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and one photograph in Lifestyle section is by Gagnon, it follows that the other photograph in Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes (since Gagnon cannot have a photograph in the Metro section).
  - Since each section must have exactly two photographs, and one photograph in Lifestyle and one in Sports are already assigned to Gagnon and Hue, then Hue and Fuentes must each have one photograph in the Metro section and one photograph in the Sports section.
  - Thus, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes (since Hue must have one photograph in the Metro section), and exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue (since Fuentes must have the same number of photographs in the Sports section as Hue).
  
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper will each have two photographs, there are a total of six different photographs, and three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. 
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. 
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("B")  

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the Lifestyle section can have at most one photograph by Fuentes. We can see that the Metro section must have at least one photograph by Fuentes since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the conditions is if exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Thus, the answer is B.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each of the three photographers has at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - There will be exactly two photographs in each of the three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there are two possibilities: Fuentes has either one or two photographs in the Lifestyle section. If Fuentes has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have one photograph in the Metro section because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. This means that the other photograph in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes, so it must be by Gagnon. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Choice B is true.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear in three sections of the newspaper: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Two photographs per section.
  - Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer must have at least one photo, but no more than three photos.
  - At least one photo in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photo in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photos in the Sports section.
  - Gagnon's photos cannot be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then it means that one of the two photographers (Fuentes or Gagnon) must have all the photos in the Metro section. Since Gagnon already has a photo in the Lifestyle section, it means that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Therefore, the answer is B.

  If there are two batches of cookies made on Monday, then there must be at least one batch of cookies made on Wednesday. Therefore, option C is false.
  If there are two batches of cookies made on Thursday, then there must be at least one batch of cookies made on Wednesday. Therefore, option D is false.
  If there are exactly three batches of cookies made on Friday, then there must be at least one batch of cookies made on Wednesday. Therefore, option B is false.

Action: Answer("A")  
Therefore, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - It is possible that only one or two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. This choice is not necessarily true.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. - It is possible that only one or two batches of cookies are made on Friday. This choice is not necessarily true.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday. - This choice is not necessarily true, because only one batch of cookies could be made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday. - This choice is not necessarily true, because only one batch of cookies could be made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday. - This choice is not necessarily true, because the same number of batches of cookies could be made on both Monday and Tuesday.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are 3 types of cookies made in 3 batches each, for a total of 9 batches of cookies each week.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday:
    * There are 4 days (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday) to make the 9 batches of cookies.
    * At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
    * No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
    * We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so there can be only one batch of sugar cookies on a day.
    * The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so there can be only one day when these two types of cookies are made together.
    
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are 4 days (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday) to make the 9 batches of cookies. If exactly one batch of each type of cookie is made on each of the 4 remaining days, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. Therefore, "Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday" must be true.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are only three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - There are three batches of each type of cookie made each week.
  - Each batch of cookies is made in a single day.
  - No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible orders for the batches: MTP, TWP, TTP, or TPT.

Analysis:
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are two possible schedules for the week: MTP TWP TTP or MTP TWP TPT.
  - If the schedule is MTP TWP TTP, then there are no batches of cookies made on Friday, so the only batches of cookies that can be made on Friday are the third batches of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies.
  - If the schedule is MTP TWP TPT, then there are no batches of cookies made on Tuesday, so the only batches of cookies that can be made on Tuesday are the third batches of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday)
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, that means the three batches of cookies made on Wednesday are not oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar, in any order. 

On Monday, at least one batch of cookies was made, so at most two batches of cookies were not made on Monday.

If two batches of cookies were not made on Monday, then all three batches of cookies would have to be made on Tuesday, which contradicts the given information that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.

Therefore, only one batch of cookies was not made on Monday. That batch must be one of oatmeal, peanut butter, or sugar.

If the missing batch is oatmeal, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must have been made on Monday, which contradicts the given information that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. 

If the missing batch is peanut butter, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Wednesday, which is not possible.

Therefore, the missing batch is sugar. The first batch of sugar cookies was made on Monday, the second batch of sugar cookies was made on Thursday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies was made on Friday. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookies are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday:
    - The first batch of oatmeal cookies must have been made on Monday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Wednesday.
    - The second batch of oatmeal cookies must have been made on Tuesday, and the second batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Thursday.
    - The first batch of sugar cookies must have been made on Tuesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must have been made on Thursday.
    - Thus, on Friday, one batch of each cookie must be made.
    
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - Not necessarily true. Only one batch of cookies need to be made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. - This is true based on the scenario described.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday. - Not necessarily true. At least one batch of cookies need to be made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday. - Not necessarily true. Only one batch of sugar cookies need to be made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday. - Not necessarily true. An equal number of batches of each cookie are made on Monday and Tuesday. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. There are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week.
  3. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  4. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  5. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  6. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

To solve the problem, we can use the process of elimination:
A: It is possible that there are only two batches of cookies made on Tuesday, so this is not necessarily true.
B: If there are no batches of cookies made on Wednesday, and there are exactly three batches of each kind of cookie made each week, then exactly three batches of cookies must be made on Friday. This must be true since there are no other days left in the week to make the remaining batches.
C: If no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, then it is not possible for at least two batches of cookies to be made on Monday.
D: The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so it is not possible for at least two batches of cookies to be made on Thursday.
E: There is no information given to compare the number of batches made on Monday and Tuesday, so this is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then:
- The first two oatmeal and peanut butter batches must be on Monday and Tuesday (in either order).
- The second sugar batch must be on Thursday.
- Therefore, the third oatmeal and peanut butter batches must be on Friday (in either order).
- Thus, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
- Therefore, the answer is B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the only possible days for the third batch of each type of cookie are Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Since all three batches of each kind of cookie must be made by Friday, exactly one of the three batches must be made on Friday. Therefore, exactly two batches of cookies must be made on another day. Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, these two batches must be of different kinds of cookies. The only day on which two different kinds of cookies can be made is Monday, so the two batches must be made on Monday. Therefore, at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday. 

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made either on Tuesday or on Thursday. If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. This means that no batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Thursday, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday. This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Thursday (because it cannot be made on Tuesday). Thus, no batches of oatmeal, peanut butter, or sugar cookies can be made on Wednesday. This leaves Monday, Tuesday, and Friday as the only days on which batches of cookies can be made.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A teacher will assign each of five students—Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga—to exactly one of two research teams, the green team and the red team. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams, one with two members and the other with three members.
  
Analysis:
  We know Lateefah is assigned to the green team, so the team with 2 members is the red team. 
  Olga is assigned to the team with 3 members, which is the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be on the red team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Mei must be the facilitator on the red team.
  From this, we know that Lateefah is not a facilitator, so B cannot be true.
  Since Juana is on the red team, she is not assigned to the green team, so C cannot be true.
  Mei is a facilitator, so D cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Therefore, the only statement that must be true is E. Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are two research teams: green and red.
- One team has 2 members and the other has 3 members.
- One member of each team is a facilitator.
- Lateefah is assigned to the green team and Kelly is not a facilitator.
- Olga is a facilitator and Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.

Analysis:
- Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team must have 3 members and the red team must have 2 members.
- Kelly is not a facilitator, and Olga is a facilitator. Therefore, Kelly must be on the red team, and Olga must be on the green team.
- Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, Juana must be on the red team.
- This leaves Mei to be the only remaining member, and Mei must be on the green team and not a facilitator.
- Therefore, neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator, and Lateefah is the only facilitator on the green team.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are five students- Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.

Analysis:
  From the given information, we know that Lateefah is assigned to the green team and Olga is a facilitator. The green team must have three members. Therefore, Olga is one of the three members of the green team. Since Juana is not on the same team as Olga, Juana must be on the red team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Therefore, Mei must be the facilitator on the red team. Hence, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  - There are two teams: the green team and the red team.
  - One team has two members, and the other team has three members.
  - One member of each team will be designated as the facilitator.
  - The conditions are:
    - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
    - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
    - Kelly is not a facilitator.
    - Olga is a facilitator.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Since Olga is a facilitator, and each team only has one facilitator, she must be on one of the teams. Lateefah is assigned to the green team, which means Olga must be on the green team, and Juana must be on the red team. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are five students - Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  Two teams - green team and red team.
  One team will have two members and the other will have three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  
Using the above conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - The green team has three members (including Lateefah as a non-facilitator).
  - The red team has two members (including Olga as a facilitator).
  - Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  - Mei must be assigned to the green team.
  - Lateefah is not a facilitator.
  - Kelly must be assigned to the red team.

Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("A") Juana is assigned to the red team.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  - One team has two members, and the other team has three members.
  - One member of each team is a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
  A: Juana can be assigned to either the green or red team, so this statement is not necessarily true.
  B: Lateefah is assigned to the green team, but we do not know if she is a facilitator or not, so this statement is not necessarily true.
  C: Olga is assigned to be a facilitator and Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga. Therefore, Olga must be assigned to the green team and Juana must be assigned to the red team. So, this statement is true.
  D: We do not know if Mei is a facilitator or not, so this statement is not necessarily true.
  E: We know that Kelly is not a facilitator, but we do not know about Juana's role, so this statement is not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are two research teams: the green team and the red team, with different numbers of members and facilitators.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: Since Olga is a facilitator, and Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana cannot be a facilitator. Therefore, there are only two facilitators: Olga and one other person. Lateefah is assigned to the green team, but we don't know whether she is a facilitator or not. Kelly is not a facilitator. Thus, Olga must be on the green team, and Juana must be on the red team. So, the answer is C.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams, one with two members and one with three members.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams, then the other team must have three members and Olga must be in that team. This means that Juana must be assigned to the red team, since Juana and Olga cannot be in the same team. Therefore, C is true. Kelly is not a facilitator, so D is true. Mei is not mentioned in the conditions, so it is possible for her to be a facilitator, and therefore D does not have to be true. Lateefah cannot be a facilitator since Olga is already a facilitator, and there are only two teams. Therefore, B is false. Since Juana is assigned to the red team, neither Juana nor Kelly can be assigned as a facilitator, so E is true. Therefore, the answer is C and E. 

Action: Answer("CE")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams: one with two members and the other with three members.
  Therefore, one team will have two members and the other will have three members.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, and there are only two teams, then the red team will have two members, and the green team will have three members.
  Since Olga is a facilitator, and there are only two teams, then Olga must be the facilitator of the green team.
  Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  Since Kelly is not a facilitator, then Mei must be the facilitator of the red team.
  Therefore, Mei and Kelly are not both facilitators.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
- One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
- One member of each team will be a facilitator.
- Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
- Kelly is not a facilitator.
- Olga is a facilitator.
- Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
- Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, and there is only one facilitator per team, Lateefah must be the facilitator for the green team.
- Since Olga is a facilitator, and there is only one facilitator per team, Olga must be the facilitator for the red team.
- Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, and Olga is the facilitator for the red team, Juana must be assigned to the green team.
- Since there are five students, and Lateefah and Olga have been assigned as facilitators, Mei must be assigned to the green team, and Kelly must be assigned to the red team.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses, and all of them will be shown during the day.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Solution:
  According to the given rules, J must be shown in the evening, so options A, B, C, D and E are not correct. 
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so option B is not correct.
  The only option left is E, which says that both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. This option is possible because we know that K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening. Since we already have two houses to be shown in the evening (J and one more), K must be shown in the afternoon. That means that both N and P can be shown in the evening after K. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day, with specific rules on when some of them can be shown.
  J must be shown in the evening, so it cannot be one of the houses shown in the morning or afternoon.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, which means it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K and before M.
  M must be shown in the afternoon.
  N and O can be shown at any time, but they must be shown after the fifth house is shown.
  P can be shown at any time, but it must be shown after the fifth house is shown.
  
Analysis:
  A: If K is shown at some time after J is shown, then J cannot be shown in the evening, which contradicts the rule that J must be shown in the evening. This choice is not possible.
  B: L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Since M must be shown in the afternoon, L can only be shown in the afternoon or evening. If L is shown in the afternoon, then K must be shown in the morning, which contradicts the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, L must be shown in the evening, which means it is shown at some time after J is shown. This choice is possible.
  C: P can be shown at any time, but it must be shown after the fifth house is shown. This choice is possible.
  D: N and O can be shown at any time, but they must be shown after the fifth house is shown. M is the fifth house, so N and O can only be shown in the evening. This choice is possible.
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. If K is shown in the afternoon, then N and P must be shown in the evening, which means they are shown at some time after J is shown. This choice is possible.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses to the buyer: J, K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  The first two houses will be shown in the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon, and the sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Analysis:
  A: If K is shown at some time after J is shown, then J must be shown in the morning and K must be shown in the afternoon or evening, which violates the given rule that K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: If L is shown at some time after J is shown, then J must be shown in the morning, which violates the given rule that J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: Since J must be shown in the evening, and P is the only house left to show after J, P must be shown at some time after J is shown. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: Since M is shown in the afternoon, and N and O are the only houses left to show after M, both N and O must be shown in the evening. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: Since K cannot be shown in the morning, and the only house left to show after K is P, P must be shown in the afternoon or evening. Therefore, N cannot be shown at some time after K is shown. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening. 
  K cannot be shown in the morning. 
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  A: If K is shown at some time after J is shown, it contradicts the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning because J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If L is shown at some time after J is shown, it contradicts the rule that J must be shown in the evening because L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: It is possible for P to be shown at some time after J is shown because there are no restrictions on the order of showing P. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: It is not possible for both N and O to be shown at some time after M is shown because there are only two houses shown in the evening, and J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, D is not true.
  E: It is not possible for both N and P to be shown at some time after K is shown because N, O, and P are shown in the afternoon and evening, and K is shown in the morning. Therefore, E is not true.
  
Action: Answer("C")

Eliminating choices:
  A: If K is shown after J, then J cannot be shown in the evening as J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: L must be shown at some time after K is shown, so L cannot be shown before K is shown. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: J must be shown in the evening, so P cannot be shown after J is shown in the evening. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: The rules do not provide any information about N and O. Therefore, D cannot be determined.
  E: The rules do not provide any information about P and N being shown together. Therefore, E cannot be determined.

  The realtor will show 7 houses (J, K, L, M, N, O, and P) during a single day. 
  The first and second houses will be shown in the morning. 
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon. 
  The sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

A: K cannot be shown in the morning. J must be shown in the evening. It is not possible for K to be shown after J is shown. Therefore, A is not true.
B: J must be shown in the evening. L must be shown at some time after K is shown. Therefore, it is possible that L is shown at some time after J is shown. Therefore, B could be true.
C: J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, it is possible that P is shown at some time after J is shown. Therefore, C could be true.
D: M must be shown at some time after L is shown. Therefore, it is not possible for both N and O to be shown at some time after M is shown. Therefore, D is not true.
E: K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, it is not possible for both N and P to be shown at some time after K is shown. Therefore, E is not true.

Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day.
  The first and second houses will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Since J must be shown in the evening, it cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  According to the rule, K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  Since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, it must be shown in the afternoon.
  Therefore, the morning houses must be some combination of N, O, and P.
  P is the only house that could be shown at some time after J is shown.
  Therefore, it is possible that L is shown at some time after J is shown. 
  So, the answer is B.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show 7 houses during a single day: J, K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

A: K cannot be shown in the morning, and J is shown in the evening. Therefore, K cannot be shown at some time after J is shown.
B: J is shown in the evening, and L must be shown at some time after K is shown, which means that L cannot be shown at some time after J is shown.
C: J is shown in the evening, and there is no restriction on when P can be shown relative to J. Therefore, P could be shown at some time after J is shown.
D: There is no restriction on when N and O can be shown relative to M. Therefore, both N and O could be shown at some time after M is shown.
E: L must be shown at some time after K is shown, and both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. There is no restriction on when K is shown relative to J. Therefore, both N and P could be shown at some time after K is shown.

Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  - The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  - The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  - J must be shown in the evening.
  - K cannot be shown in the morning.
  - L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

A: K is shown at some time after J is shown.
  - J must be shown in the evening, K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K is shown after J only if J and K are shown in the afternoon or evening.
  - However, L must be shown at some time after K is shown, and L must be shown before M is shown. Therefore, if K is shown after J, then L must be shown after K and before M. This means that J, K, and L are all shown in the afternoon or evening, which is not possible since only five houses can be shown in the afternoon.
B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
  - J must be shown in the evening, so L cannot be shown after J.
C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
  - J must be shown in the evening, so P cannot be shown after J.
D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown.
  - There is no information about N or O's showing relative to M's showing, so this could be true.
E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown.
  - There is no information about N or P's showing relative to K's showing, so this could be true.

  1. The realtor will show seven houses during a single day.
  2. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  3. The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  4. The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  5. J must be shown in the evening.
  6. K cannot be shown in the morning.
  7. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is not shown before J is shown. Therefore, K cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. This option is false.
  B: J must be shown in the evening, so L cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. Therefore, this option is false.
  C: J must be shown in the evening, so P can only be shown at some time after J is shown. This option could be true.
  D: N and O are not mentioned in the context, so this option is false.
  E: N and P can be shown at some time after K is shown, but we do not know if both of them will be shown at the same time after K is shown. Therefore, this option is false.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Each trade involves exactly one building of equal value with another building.
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  If Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings, then Southco would have to trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, but Trustcorp would then own a class 3 building. Therefore Trustcorp cannot trade their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades away a class 2 building for a building of equal value, then they will still own a class 2 building after the trade.
  Therefore Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for a class 1 building.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means it has traded all the class 2 buildings it owned.
  Any trade that Trustcorp makes has to be of one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. Thus, Trustcorp cannot own any class 2 building after the trade.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building, which is the Lynch Building. If Trustcorp has made a trade with Southco and got the Lynch Building in return, it would violate the rule that Trustcorp cannot own any class 2 building after the trade. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  
Analysis:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so it cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for one or two class 1 buildings or one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for one or two class 1 buildings, then it would own at least one class 2 building after the trade.
  Thus, Trustcorp must trade one class 2 building for one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Since Trustcorp owns all three class 2 buildings, it must trade one of them to RealProp or Southco.
  Therefore, Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower).
  Southco owns a class 1 building (Flores Tower) and a class 2 building (Lynch Building).
  Thus, Southco does not own only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower (it is owned by RealProp).
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so it cannot own the Zimmer House (which is a class 3 building).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
    - RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1).
    - This information was given in the knowledge.
    - True.
    
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
    - Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
    - Southco can trade the Flores Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings, but then it will own two class 2 buildings and one class 3 building.
    - Thus, Southco cannot own only class 2 buildings.
    - False.
    
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
    - Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
    - Southco cannot trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
    - Thus, Southco cannot make any trade with Trustcorp.
    - False.
    
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
    - RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1).
    - Trustcorp cannot trade one of its class 2 buildings for the Garza Tower (class 1).
    - False.
    
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
    - RealProp owns the Zimmer House (class 3).
    - Trustcorp cannot trade one of its class 2 buildings for the Zimmer House (class 3).
    - False.
    
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  
  We need to find an option that must be true given that Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
Analysis:
  Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, which means it can only trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or a class 2 building for one class 1 building or one class 3 building.

  If Trustcorp trades a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, it will own at least one class 2 building, which contradicts the given information that Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades. Therefore, Trustcorp cannot trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.

  Trustcorp can trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building or one class 3 building. In both cases, Trustcorp will own one less class 2 building. Since Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings, it can make at most two such trades. This means that after some number of trades, Trustcorp will still own at least one class 2 building.

  Therefore, it must be true that Trustcorp has not made any trades with either RealProp or Southco. This means that RealProp and Southco have traded with each other. Since Southco owns only class 1 and class 2 buildings, it must have traded a class 2 building with RealProp for a class 1 or class 3 building.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
- Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only way to trade a class 2 building.
- Trustcorp can only trade one of the three class 2 buildings it owns in exchange for two class 3 buildings.
- Therefore, Trustcorp needs to make at least one trade with another company that has class 3 buildings.
- RealProp has two class 3 buildings, so it is a good candidate for Trustcorp to trade with.

Analysis:
- If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings with RealProp, RealProp will receive a class 2 building.
- If RealProp receives a class 2 building in exchange, then RealProp will have at least one class 2 building.
- However, the question states that Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
- Therefore, Trustcorp cannot trade any of its class 2 buildings with RealProp.
- Trustcorp can only trade its class 2 buildings with Southco.
- If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings with Southco, Southco will receive a class 2 building.
- Southco will then own two class 2 buildings, which means it cannot trade any of its class 2 buildings with Trustcorp anymore.
- Therefore, Southco must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp before Southco owned two class 2 buildings.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns 3 buildings, including a class 1 building.
  Southco owns 2 buildings, including a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns 3 class 2 buildings.
  The trades must be one-for-one trades of same-class buildings, one-for-two trades of class 1 for class 2 buildings, or one-for-two trades of class 2 for class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot own any class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
Analysis: 
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it must mean that it has traded all of its class 2 buildings. Since Trustcorp only owns class 2 buildings, this means that Trustcorp has made at least one trade with either RealProp or Southco to trade away its class 2 building for either a class 1 or class 3 building. 
  
  A: It is possible that RealProp owns a class 1 building, but it is not necessarily true.
  B: Southco owning only class 2 buildings is not possible since it already owns a class 1 building.
  C: This must be true since Trustcorp has to trade away its class 2 building to either RealProp or Southco.
  D: Trustcorp owning the Garza Tower is not possible since it is a class 1 building and Trustcorp only owns class 2 buildings.
  E: Trustcorp owning the Zimmer House is not possible since it is a class 3 building and Trustcorp only owns class 2 buildings.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings will not result in owning a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp needs to trade one of its class 2 buildings for a class 1 building to participate in the other two types of trades.
  After that trade, Trustcorp will have two class 2 buildings and one class 1 building.
  If Southco trades its class 1 building, it will only have class 2 buildings left.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
If Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower, then it can trade the Garza Tower for two of Southco's class 2 buildings. Trustcorp will then own only class 2 and class 3 buildings, and RealProp will own a class 1 building. Therefore, if Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, Trustcorp must own the Garza Tower.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings before any trade.
- Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings means Trustcorp would no longer have any class 2 buildings.
- Trustcorp can trade the King Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building, which are all class 2 buildings.
- If Trustcorp trades one of their class 2 buildings for one of RealProp's class 1 buildings, RealProp would own a class 1 building.
- Southco owns two buildings, one of class 1 and one of class 2, before any trade.
- Southco cannot trade their class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
- If Southco trades their class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, they would still own a class 1 building.
- Southco can only trade with either RealProp or Trustcorp.
- Trustcorp must trade one of their class 2 buildings for either one of RealProp's class 1 buildings or Southco's class 2 building to get rid of all their class 2 buildings.
- If Trustcorp trades one of their class 2 buildings for one of Southco's class 2 buildings, then Southco would own two class 2 buildings.
- If Trustcorp trades one of their class 2 buildings for one of RealProp's class 1 buildings, then RealProp would own a class 1 building.
- Trustcorp cannot trade one of their class 2 buildings for one of RealProp's class 3 buildings because it would violate the trading condition.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are three companies named RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp who are trading buildings with each other.
  Each building is categorized into class 1, class 2, or class 3, and there are specific buildings owned by each company.
  Trustcorp does not own any class 2 building after some number of trades.
  A: There is a class 1 building owned by RealProp, but it does not provide any information regarding Trustcorp's ownership of the class 2 buildings.
  B: Southco owns Lynch Building, which is a class 2 building, so this option is not true.
  C: There is no information about whether Southco has made any trades with Trustcorp, so this option cannot be determined.
  D: Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, so Trustcorp cannot own it.
  E: Zimmer House is owned by RealProp, so Trustcorp cannot own it.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, the order could be either Wellspring, Xpert, Zircon or Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert.
- Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.

Analysis:
- If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Zircon must perform before Wellspring, which means that Zircon must perform in either slot one or two.
- Vegemite must perform before Zircon, which means that Vegemite cannot perform in slot five or six because those slots are after Zircon.
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, which means that Yardsign could perform in slot one, two, or three.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, which means that Uneasy could perform in slot four, five, or six.

Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, Zircon could perform in slot two.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will fill the six slots numbered one to six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
  A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, then slot six will be left for Zircon which contradicts the condition that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. So, this option can't be true.
  B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon will perform in slot six, which contradicts the condition that Zircon performs in a slot earlier than Xpert. So, this option can't be true.
  C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then there are two possibilities for slots four, five, and six: Uneasy, Xpert, and Zircon. If Uneasy and Xpert perform in slots five and six, respectively, then Zircon will perform in slot two, which contradicts the condition that Zircon performs in a slot earlier than Xpert. Therefore, Zircon must perform in slot five, and Uneasy will perform in slot six to meet the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. So, this option could be true.
  D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then either Wellspring or Vegemite will perform in slot one, which contradicts the condition that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Therefore, this option can't be true.
  E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then Xpert will perform in slot six, which contradicts the condition that Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert. Therefore, this option can't be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) are performing in 6 slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
Process of elimination:
  - Option A conflicts with the constraint that Uneasy can perform in only one of the last three slots.
  - Option B conflicts with the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Option C is possible because Wellspring is performing immediately before Xpert.
  - Option D conflicts with the constraint that Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Option E is possible because Zircon can perform in slot four while Wellspring performs in slot three and Xpert performs in slot five.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - There are six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Each band performs in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  We know that Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert. Therefore, the order of the two bands must be Wellspring, Xpert. Based on this fact and the given constraints:
  A: It is not possible because Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  B: It is not possible because Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  C: Wellspring can only perform in slot two if Xpert performs in slot three. This is possible.
  D: It is not possible because Zircon must perform in a later slot than Wellspring.
  E: It is not possible because Zircon must perform in a later slot than Xpert.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six slots numbered from one to six.
  2. There are six bands named Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  3. Each band will perform in just one slot.
  4. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  5. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  6. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  7. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  If we draw a table to visualize the problem, we can see that Wellspring must be in slot two, and Xpert must be in slot four. The possible slots for Uneasy are 4, 5, and 6. The possible slots for Vegemite are 1, 2, and 3. Zircon must be in slot six because it can't be in slot two or four.
  
| Slot 1 | Slot 2 | Slot 3 | Slot 4 | Slot 5 | Slot 6 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Vegemite | Wellspring |  | Xpert |  | Zircon |

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The slots are numbered from one to six and each slot is filled by only one band.
  Vegemite performs earlier than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon perform earlier than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order may be one of the following:
    1) Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, ..., ..., ...
    2) Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Uneasy
    3) Yardsign, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, ..., ...
    4) Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, ..., ...
    
Analysis:
  A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, it means that Xpert and Yardsign will perform in slots four and six, respectively. This violates the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then the order may be Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert and Uneasy. This is a possible order because Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, this option is possible.
  C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Xpert and Zircon will perform in slots four and five, respectively. This violates the constraint that both Wellspring and Zircon perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then the order may be Yardsign, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Vegemite and Uneasy. This is not a possible order because Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then the order may be Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert and Uneasy. This is a possible order because Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, this option is possible.

    * Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    * Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    * Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    * Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order is: [__, __, __, Wellspring, Xpert, __].
  - Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, then the only possible places for Yardsign are slots one, two, or three.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order is: [__, __, __, Wellspring, Xpert, __].
  - Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, then the only possible places for Yardsign are slots one, two, or three.
  - Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, then Zircon cannot perform in slot two. Therefore, D and E are eliminated.
  - If Uneasy performs in slot five, then it leaves only slot four for Zircon, which is impossible since Wellspring must perform in slot four. Therefore, A is eliminated.
  - If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Vegemite must perform in slot two, which satisfies the constraints. Therefore, C is a possible answer.
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot six, which is impossible since Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, B is a possible answer. 
  - Therefore, the answer is B or Vegemite performs in slot three.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
To satisfy condition 5, the possible orders of Wellspring, Xpert, and Zircon are:
  1. Wellspring, Xpert, Zircon (Condition 2 is satisfied)
  2. Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert (Condition 2 is satisfied)
  
If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the three slots for Wellspring, Xpert, and Zircon can be: 
  1. Slot 1, Slot 2, Slot 3
  2. Slot 2, Slot 3, Slot 4
  3. Slot 3, Slot 4, Slot 5
  4. Slot 4, Slot 5, Slot 6
  
A: Uneasy performs in slot five. (Not possible, since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots - Condition 3)
B: Vegemite performs in slot three. (Not possible, since Zircon should perform after Vegemite - Condition 1)
C: Wellspring performs in slot three. (Possible, since Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert - Condition 5)
D: Zircon performs in slot two. (Not possible, since Wellspring should perform before Zircon - Condition 2)
E: Zircon performs in slot four. (Possible, since Zircon can perform after Xpert - Condition 2)

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - Six bands will perform in just one slot each.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring must perform in slot two or slot three.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered one through six, and six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then we know that Wellspring and Zircon perform in slots one and two, in some order, and Xpert performs in slot three.
  
Analysis: 
  - Since Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, it cannot be true that Uneasy performs in slot five. 
  - Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, it cannot be true that Vegemite performs in slot three. 
  - If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot two, which contradicts the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. 
  - If Zircon performs in slot two, then Vegemite must perform in slot one, and Wellspring must perform in slot four. This satisfies all of the constraints, so the answer is D: Zircon performs in slot two.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke
Response 0:
Knowledge:
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela:
- Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

The only country we know for sure which ambassador will be sent is Venezuela, which will be assigned to Ong. However, we can use the given information to deduce some possible assignments for the other two ambassadors. 

If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela:
- Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, either Jaramillo or Novetzke will be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Kayne will be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, if Landon is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke will be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.

Option A is not possible because Landon cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
Option B is not possible because Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
Option C is not possible because Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
Option D is possible because Jaramillo can be assigned as ambassador to Zambia and Novetzke can be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
Option E is not possible because Landon cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, which means that Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one of the countries, then Kayne would also be assigned to one of the countries.
  Landon is assigned only to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  Therefore, the only possible combination of ambassadors is Jaramillo and Landon or Kayne and Novetzke.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  2. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  3. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  4. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  5. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Analysis: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. From constraint 3, if Jaramillo is assigned an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned an ambassadorship. Therefore, if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Jaramillo must not be assigned an ambassadorship. From constraint 5, if Landon is assigned an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia. Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned an ambassadorship to one of the remaining countries. Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, so he must be assigned to the remaining country, which is the one not assigned to Jaramillo or Novetzke. Thus, the other two ambassadors assigned are Novetzke and Landon. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
- Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
- An ambassador cannot be assigned to more than one country.
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
- We need to find two possible ambassadors to be assigned to Yemen and Zambia.

Action: Answer("E") 

If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen, and Landon must be assigned to Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must be assigned to the remaining ambassadorship. Therefore, the two possible ambassadors to be assigned to Yemen and Zambia are Novetzke and Landon. Hence, the answer is E.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  - Only one ambassador can be assigned to each country.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
  Option A is not possible because Jaramillo and Landon cannot both be assigned as ambassadors since Jaramillo and Kayne are always assigned together.
  
  Option B is not possible because either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Novetzke is not assigned, then Kayne must be.

  Option C is not possible because Landon is assigned to Zambia.

  Option D is possible if Novetzke is assigned as the ambassador to Yemen and Kayne is assigned as the ambassador to Zambia.

  Option E is not possible because we have already assigned Ong and it is stated that only one ambassador can be assigned to each country.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  There are three ambassadorships to assign, one to each country, and each ambassadorship will be assigned to one of the five candidates.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must be assigned as well. Therefore, if Jaramillo is not assigned as ambassador, then Kayne cannot be assigned either. This means that either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned to the last remaining country, which is Yemen. Therefore, the answer must be a combination of Landon, Jaramillo, Kayne, and Novetzke that has Landon assigned to Zambia, one of Jaramillo/Kayne assigned to Venezuela, and the other one assigned to either Yemen or the remaining country.

Action: Answer("B") => Jaramillo and Novetzke
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Thus, Kayne can only be assigned as ambassador to Zambia or Venezuela. If Kayne is assigned to Venezuela, then Jaramillo must also be assigned to Venezuela, and Landon must be assigned to Zambia. In this case, Novetzke would not be assigned to any of the ambassadorships. If Kayne is assigned to Zambia, then either Jaramillo or Novetzke must be assigned to Venezuela. In this case, Landon would be assigned to Zambia and the remaining candidate would be assigned to Yemen.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The three countries that need ambassadors are Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia.
- The five candidates for the ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong.
- One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Action: Answer("A") 

If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen, and either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, the only option for the other two ambassadors assigned is Jaramillo and Landon.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
  A: Jaramillo cannot be assigned as an ambassador because if he is assigned as an ambassador, Kayne must also be assigned as an ambassador, which is impossible since only one ambassador can be assigned out of Kayne and Novetzke.
  
  B: Jaramillo cannot be assigned as an ambassador because if he is assigned as an ambassador, Kayne must also be assigned as an ambassador, which is impossible since only one ambassador can be assigned out of Kayne and Novetzke.
  
  C: If Landon is assigned as an ambassador to Zambia, then the only option left is to assign Novetzke as the ambassador to Yemen and Kayne as the ambassador to Venezuela.
  
  D: This is a possible combination because Kayne can be assigned as the ambassador to Venezuela and Novetzke can be assigned as the ambassador to Yemen. Landon can be assigned as the ambassador to Zambia.
  
  E: Jaramillo cannot be assigned as an ambassador because if he is assigned as an ambassador, Kayne must also be assigned as an ambassador, which is impossible since only one ambassador can be assigned out of Kayne and Novetzke. Landon cannot be assigned as an ambassador because he must be assigned as an ambassador to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Ong is assigned to Venezuela, which means Kayne is not assigned to Yemen.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned.
  - If Landon is assigned, then it is to Zambia.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that Ong is assigned to Venezuela, which means Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned. However, we do not know whether Jaramillo is assigned or not.
  - We also know that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  - If Landon is assigned, then it is to Zambia. However, we do not know whether Landon is assigned or not.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  - If Ong is assigned to Venezuela and Jaramillo and Novetzke are assigned to the other two countries, then all the constraints are satisfied. 
  - Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Novetzke.

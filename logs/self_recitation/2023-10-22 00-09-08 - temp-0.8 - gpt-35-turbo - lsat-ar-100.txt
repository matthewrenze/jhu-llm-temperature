Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Five students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian and O'Neill) review three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Only two students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Exactly three students review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  
  A: We know that exactly three students review Undulation, so if Megregian does not review Undulation, then it means Megregian must have reviewed Tamerlane and Sunset. This would imply that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, which contradicts the given condition. Hence, this cannot be true.
  B: We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so if O'Neill does not review Undulation, it means that he must have reviewed Tamerlane and Sunset. This would imply that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, which contradicts the given condition. Hence, this cannot be true.
  C: If exactly three students review Undulation, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, then Jiang must review Undulation. This could be true.
  D: We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so if Lopez reviews Tamerlane, it would mean that exactly three students review Tamerlane (Kramer, O'Neill, and Lopez), which contradicts the given condition that exactly three students review Undulation. Hence, this cannot be true.
  E: We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so if O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer must review Sunset as well. This would imply that exactly three students review Sunset (Kramer, O'Neill, and Megregian), which contradicts the given condition that exactly three students review Undulation. Hence, this cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The students are Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  They review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed the same play or plays as each other.
  A: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and Megregian does not review Undulation, then Megregian must review the play that the other two students reviewed. This is impossible because only Kramer and O'Neill reviewed the same play, Tamerlane.
  B: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and O'Neill does not review Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez must review Undulation along with one other play. This is impossible because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  C: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and Jiang reviews Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed the same play or plays as each other. This is possible.
  D: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian must review Undulation because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This is impossible because only Kramer and O'Neill reviewed the same play, Tamerlane.
  E: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer and Lopez must review Undulation along with one other play. This is impossible because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  5 students - Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill
  3 plays - Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. 
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students cannot review Undulation.
  
  A: We do not know if Megregian reviews Undulation or not.
  B: We do not know if O'Neill reviews Undulation or not.
  C: Jiang cannot review Undulation as neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  D: We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so it is not possible for Lopez to review Tamerlane.
  E: We do not know if O'Neill reviews Sunset or not. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Five students are reviewing three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
- Exactly two of the students review the same play or plays as each other.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.

Analysis:
- If exactly three of the students review Undulation, the possible combinations of students who reviewed Undulation are: 
    i. Jiang, Kramer, Lopez
    ii. Jiang, Kramer, Megregian
    iii. Jiang, Lopez, Megregian
    iv. Kramer, Lopez, Megregian
- From the given conditions, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot be part of any combination that includes Undulation.

A: Megregian does not review Undulation. - If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then Megregian should be one of them. This choice is not possible.
B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. - This choice is possible because O'Neill cannot be one of the students who reviewed Undulation.
C: Jiang reviews Undulation. - This choice is possible as Jiang can be one of the students who reviewed Undulation.
D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. - This is not possible as Lopez is already part of a combination that includes Undulation, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. - This choice is not related to Undulation, and O'Neill cannot review Sunset because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are five students who review the plays Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the two students who reviewed the same play must not have reviewed Undulation. 
  From the given conditions, Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, so they cannot be two of the students who reviewed the same play.
  This means that the two students who reviewed the same play must be among Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian.
  Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, this means that Jiang is one of the students who reviewed Undulation, and the other two students are among Lopez and Megregian.
  This means that O'Neill did not review Undulation.
  
Action: Answer(B)
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- There are three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
- Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
- Kramer and Lopez < Megregian.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Action: Answer("A")
Reasoning: 
If exactly three students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must have reviewed either Sunset or Tamerlane. 
From the rules given, we can conclude that:
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, neither of them can review Undulation. 
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang must have reviewed either Sunset or Tamerlane.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. This means that at least two students reviewed the same play, which could be Undulation or another play.
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. This means that Megregian reviewed at least two plays and either Kramer or Lopez reviewed only one. 
Therefore, if Megregian reviews Undulation along with two other students, those two students could be Jiang and either Kramer or Lopez. In this case, Megregian would have reviewed Undulation, while Kramer or Lopez would have reviewed only one play, making statement (A) true.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Five students are reviewing Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must have reviewed the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the two students that reviewed the same play or plays as each other did not review Undulation. 
  Based on the given information:
  - Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, so they cannot be the two students that reviewed the same play or plays as each other.
  - Megregian reviewed either Undulation or Tamerlane, and since Megregian reviewed more plays than Kramer and Lopez, and neither reviewed any play with Jiang, Megregian must have reviewed Tamerlane with Kramer or O'Neill.
  - If Megregian reviewed Tamerlane with Kramer or O'Neill, then Megregian did not review Undulation. Therefore, A is true and B is false.
  - Jiang did not review any play with Lopez or Megregian, so Jiang cannot be one of the three students that reviewed Undulation. Therefore, C is false.
  - If exactly three of the students reviewed Undulation, and none of the other given conditions are true, then the two students that reviewed the same play or plays as each other must have reviewed Sunset. Therefore, E is also false.
  - Since the two students that reviewed the same play or plays as each other did not review Undulation, and O'Neill reviewed Tamerlane, Lopez must have reviewed Undulation. Therefore, D is true.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Five students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review one or more of exactly three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation), but do not review any other plays.
  Kramer and Lopez both review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, the other two students must have reviewed Tamerlane. Since Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, then neither Kramer nor O'Neill is one of the three students who reviewed Undulation. So, we can eliminate options B and E. 
  Since Megregian reviews fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez, then Megregian must have reviewed either one or two of the three plays. If Megregian reviewed two of the three plays, then Megregian could not have reviewed Undulation since exactly three of the students reviewed Undulation. So, we can eliminate option A.
  We know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So, if exactly three of the students reviewed Undulation, then Jiang couldn't have reviewed Undulation. Therefore, we can eliminate option C.
  That leaves us with option D.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  Three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Each student reviews one or more of the three plays.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  We know from the question that exactly three of the students review Undulation.
  
Solution:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, then the remaining two students (who did not review Undulation) must have reviewed the same play or plays as each other.
  We also know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, if Jiang reviews Undulation, then Megregian must have reviewed Tamerlane or Sunset which contradicts the fact that exactly two of the students review the same play or plays as each other.
  Hence, Jiang does not review Undulation.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, then he must have reviewed Tamerlane or Sunset along with O'Neill or Kramer. But that would mean that there are more than two students who review the same play or plays as each other, which contradicts the given fact.
  Hence, Megregian reviews Undulation.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, and Megregian reviews Undulation, then the remaining two students who did not review Undulation must have reviewed the same play or plays as each other.
  But Kramer and O'Neill have already reviewed Tamerlane, so they cannot review the same play or plays as each other. Hence, one of them must have reviewed Sunset.
  Since Lopez and Megregian cannot review the same play or plays as each other, and Megregian has already reviewed Undulation, Lopez must have reviewed Sunset along with either O'Neill or Kramer.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is option E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Five students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review exactly one or more of three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  - Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  A: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students did not review Undulation. However, since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, it means Megregian, Lopez, and Jiang review Undulation. Hence, this statement is false.
  B: We do not know for sure which play O'Neill reviews. Hence, this statement could be true.
  C: It is given that neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews. Hence, this statement is false.
  D: From the given information, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Hence, this statement is false.
  E: From the given information, we cannot determine which play O'Neill reviews. Hence, this statement could be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest. 
  The targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day for each client's website and voicemail service. 
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. 
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Analysis:
We need to determine which of the targets can only be assigned to one client and not to any other. Since there are six targets in total, and three clients, it is necessary that at least one target be assigned to two or more clients.

A 1-day website target could be assigned to Image and Solide, so this target could be shared by two clients. Therefore, option A cannot be the answer.

A 2-day voicemail target could be assigned to Image and Truvest, so this target could be shared by two clients. Therefore, option B cannot be the answer.

A 2-day website target could be assigned to Solide and Truvest, so this target could be shared by two clients. Therefore, option C cannot be the answer.

A 3-day voicemail target could be assigned to Image, Solide, or Truvest. Therefore, option D is a possible answer.

A 3-day website target could be assigned to Image, Solide, or Truvest. Therefore, option E is a possible answer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The six targets are divided into three levels: 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day.
  Two targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
  A: There's no restriction on setting a 1-day website target for more than one client.
  B: There's no restriction on setting a 2-day voicemail target for more than one client.
  C: There's no restriction on setting a 2-day website target for more than one client.
  D: A 3-day voicemail target can be set for Image, but it cannot be set for Solide or Truvest, because they have a shorter target for voicemail.
  E: A 3-day website target can be set for Solide and Truvest, but it cannot be set for Image, because Image's website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  Two service targets are set for each client.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

A: a 1-day website target: This target can be set for more than one client.
B: a 2-day voicemail target: This target can be set for more than one client.
C: a 2-day website target: This target can be set for more than one client.
D: a 3-day voicemail target: This target can be set for more than one client.
E: a 3-day website target: This target cannot be set for more than one client, because if it were set for more than one client, then one of those clients' voicemail targets would have to be longer than their website target, which is not allowed according to the given conditions.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Six targets will be set for three clients, two targets per client.
  - There are three levels of target: 1-day, 2-day, or 3-day.
  - No client can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
  - Since there are only three clients, and two targets per client, there will be a total of six targets.
  - The targets must be assigned in such a way that all the given conditions are satisfied.
  - If a target is set for one client, it can also be set for another client, as long as the given conditions are met.

Action: Answer("D")  
  - A 3-day voicemail target cannot be set for more than one of the clients because there are only three clients, and if two clients have a 3-day voicemail target, the third client must have a 1-day or 2-day voicemail target, which violates the condition that image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, a 3-day voicemail target cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The company is setting up targets for its service response times. 
  There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest, and two targets (one for web and one for voicemail) need to be set for each client. 
  Targets can be 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. 
  There are certain conditions that must be met for setting these targets. 
  We need to find the target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients.

Analysis:
  The conditions given are:
  1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

  A 1-day website target can be set for multiple clients, as long as it is not longer than their voicemail target. 
  A 2-day voicemail target can also be set for multiple clients, as long as their website targets are not shorter than their voicemail targets. 
  A 2-day website target cannot be set for both Solide and Truvest, because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for multiple clients, as long as their website targets are not shorter than their voicemail targets. 
  A 3-day website target cannot be set for both Image and Solide, because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  
  Therefore, the target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients is a 2-day website target.
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 6:

  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- The clients are Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. 
- The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

For A, a 1-day website target may be set for all three clients.
For B, a 2-day voicemail target may be set for all three clients.
For C, a 2-day website target may be set for either Image or Solide, but not both.
For D, a 3-day voicemail target may be set for either Image or Truvest, but not both.
For E, a 3-day website target may be set for either Truvest or Solide, but not both.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest. 
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. 
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Each client has two targets, one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail, and there are three clients. Therefore, there are a total of six targets.
  Two targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
  There are six targets in total, and each client has two targets. So, if a target is set for more than one client, there will be a total of more than six targets, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to find a target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  The 3-day website target cannot be set for more than one of the clients because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. If Truvest has a 3-day website target, then Solide's website target must be shorter than 3 days, which violates the condition. Therefore, the 3-day website target cannot be set for Truvest and Solide. If Image has a 3-day website target, then the other clients can have 3-day website targets because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, the 3-day website target can be set for Image. Overall, the 3-day website target can be set for only one client, which is Image.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
    
Analysis:
  Since each company can only make one trade, the total number of buildings owned by the three companies will stay the same. 
  There are three class 1 buildings, three class 2 buildings, and three class 3 buildings among the properties of the three companies.
  In any valid trade, the number of buildings in each class that a company owns must stay the same.
  Southco has only class 1 and class 2 buildings, so it cannot trade for a class 3 building.
  The only way for RealProp to trade a class 1 building (Garza Tower) is to trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the possible trades are:
    1. RealProp trades Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings.
    2. Southco trades one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  After the trades, RealProp will own only class 3 buildings, Southco will own only class 1 buildings, and Trustcorp will own only class 2 buildings.
  Based on the above analysis, the only choice that satisfies these conditions is E.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Three types of trades are allowed: (1) trade one building for one other building of the same class, (2) trade one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, and (3) trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  RealProp has two class 3 buildings, but no class 2 buildings, so it needs to trade for class 2 buildings. 
  Southco does not have any class 3 buildings, but has one class 1 and one class 2 building, so it needs to trade for class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings, so it can trade any one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, or it can trade any one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.

Solution:
  Option A is incorrect because RealProp would need to trade one of its class 3 buildings for a class 2 building before it could enter any trades with the other two companies.
  Option B is incorrect because Trustcorp would need to trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings before it could enter any trades with the other two companies.
  Option C is incorrect because Southco would need to trade its class 1 building for two class 3 buildings before it could enter any trades with the other two companies.
  Option D is incorrect because Trustcorp would need to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings before it could enter any trades with the other two companies.
  Option E is the only one that makes sense based on the analysis. RealProp can trade Garza Tower for King Building and Ortiz Building. Southco can trade Flores Tower for Yates House and Zimmer House. Trustcorp can trade King Building for Zimmer House and Yates House. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation:
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) of Trustcorp, and Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3) of RealProp, then the buildings owned by the three companies will be:
  RealProp: the King Building (class 2), the Ortiz Building (class 2), and the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco: the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp: the Garza Tower (class 1).
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns 3 buildings (Garza Tower, Yates House, and Zimmer House)
  Southco owns 2 buildings (Flores Tower and Lynch Building)
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings (King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building)
  The trade should be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  The buildings are categorized into three classes (class 1, class 2, or class 3) based on their value.
  
Analysis:
  The only way to perform a trade with one company owning 3 buildings and the others owning 2 buildings each is to perform trade type 2 (Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings). RealProp owns the only class 1 building, the Garza Tower. Southco does not have a class 1 building for trade type 2. Trustcorp has only class 2 buildings for trade. Therefore, the only trade possible is for RealProp to trade the Garza Tower for two of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings. The two class 2 buildings in Trustcorp's possession are the King Building and the Meyer Building. Therefore, the possible buildings owned by the companies after one trade are:
   - RealProp: the Yates House and the Zimmer House (both class 3)
   - Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building (both class 2)
   - Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Garza Tower (both class 2 and class 1 respectively)
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1) Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    2) Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    3) Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.

Analysis:
  To make only one trade, the companies have to trade one building for one other building of the same class, or trade one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, but Southco only owns one class 1 building, which means RealProp can only trade with Southco if RealProp decides to trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings, which means they can trade one of them for two class 3 buildings.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  RealProp: the Garza Tower traded for two class 2 buildings, the King Building and the Ortiz Building.
  Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns class 1 and class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns class 1 and class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  
Approach:
  We need to select one combination of buildings for each of the three companies that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. After the trade, each company has only buildings of the same class. 
  2. The number of buildings of each class for each company is still the same: 1 class 1, 1 class 2, and 1 class 3. 
  3. The trade should be of only one of the three possible kinds.
 
A: RealProp has no class 2 building to trade for. Trustcorp has no class 1 or class 3 building to trade. Southco has only one of each class of building, so it cannot trade without violating condition 2. A is not a valid option.
B: RealProp has no class 2 building to trade for. Trustcorp has no class 1 or class 3 building to trade. B does not satisfy condition 3, because it involves two different kinds of trades.
C: RealProp can trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) with Southco, and can trade the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3) for two class 3 buildings with Trustcorp. Southco and Trustcorp can swap their class 2 buildings. C satisfies all three conditions and is a valid option.
D: RealProp has no class 2 building to trade for. Trustcorp has no class 1 or class 3 building to trade. D does not satisfy condition 3, because it involves two different kinds of trades.
E: RealProp can trade the Yates House (class 3) for two class 2 buildings with Trustcorp, and can trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 3 buildings with Southco. Southco can trade the Lynch Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings with Trustcorp. E satisfies all three conditions and is a valid option.

Action: Answer("C") or Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - RealProp owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings
  - Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building
  - Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings
  - The three types of trades that can be made involve buildings of specific classes, and the number of buildings being traded must match the type of trade.
Analysis:
  - To make a trade of one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, either RealProp or Southco would need to be involved in the trade, as they are the only owners of class 1 buildings. Trustcorp cannot be involved in this trade, as they do not own any class 1 buildings.
  - To make a trade of one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, Trustcorp would need to be involved in the trade, as they are the only owner of class 2 buildings. RealProp and Southco cannot be involved in this trade, as they do not own any class 2 buildings.
  - This leaves the trade of one building for one other building of the same class. RealProp could trade one of their class 3 buildings for Southco's class 2 building, or Trustcorp could trade one of their class 2 buildings for one of RealProp's class 3 buildings.
  - Therefore, after one trade, RealProp can own one class 1 building, one class 2 building, and one class 3 building; Southco can own one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings; and Trustcorp can own two class 2 buildings and one class 3 building.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Each company has at least one building of each class.
  - Trades can only occur between buildings of the same class.
  - Trades can only occur between two buildings owned by different companies.
 
Elimination Process:
  - Option A: The Flores Tower is class 1, so it cannot be owned by Trustcorp in this scenario. This option is not possible.
  - Option B: The Garza Tower is class 1, so it cannot be traded for two class 2 buildings. This option is not possible.
  - Option C: This option is possible. RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) with Southco. Trustcorp trades the Meyer Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3) with RealProp and Southco.
  - Option D: The Meyer Building is class 2, so it cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings. This option is not possible.
  - Option E: The Yates House and the Zimmer House are both class 3, so they cannot be owned by Southco in this scenario. This option is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns 3 buildings: the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns 2 buildings: the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: the King Building (class 2), the Meyer Building (class 2), and the Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  The buildings after one trade should be consistent with the above rules.
  
Analysis:
  RealProp has one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings. It cannot trade the class 1 building for two class 2 buildings (since there are no class 2 buildings owned by RealProp), and it cannot trade a class 3 building for two class 2 buildings (since there are no class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp or Southco). Therefore, RealProp can only trade one building for one other building of the same class. 
  Southco has one class 1 building and one class 2 building. It cannot trade the class 1 building for two class 2 buildings (since there is only one class 1 building), and it cannot trade the class 2 building for two class 3 buildings (since there are no class 3 buildings owned by RealProp or Southco). Therefore, Southco can only trade one building for one other building of the same class.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings. It can either trade one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. 
  
Based on the above analysis, we can come up with the following potential trades:
  1. RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) with Southco for the Flores Tower (class 1).
  2. Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) with Trustcorp for the King Building (class 2).
  
We can verify that the above trades are consistent with the given rules, and result in the following buildings owned by the three companies:
  RealProp: the Flores Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco: the Garza Tower (class 1) and the King Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp: the Lynch Building (class 2), the Meyer Building (class 2), and the Ortiz Building (class 2).
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns 3 buildings, one in class 1 and the rest are in class 3.
  Southco owns 2 buildings, one in class 1 and the other is in class 2.
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings, all in class 2.
  A trade can only involve a building or buildings of the same class or of one class higher or lower.
  
Elimination:
  Option A: The Flores Tower is not in the possession of RealProp, so this option is not possible.
  Option B: RealProp has a class 1 building which is not traded for two class 2 buildings. This option is not possible.
  Option C: The Lynch Building is not in the possession of RealProp, so this option is not possible.
  Option D: The Meyer Building is not in the possession of RealProp, so this option is not possible.
  Option E: RealProp can trade the Garza Tower for two class 3 buildings, Yates House and Zimmer House. Southco has only one class 2 building, which cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings. Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings. Therefore, RealProp can trade Garza Tower with Trustcorp's three class 2 buildings, and Southco can trade its two buildings with Yates House and Zimmer House.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - The order of the clues must meet the constraints:
    - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
    - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
    - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: 
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then we know the following:
  - Chapters 2 and 4 must mention T and X (in some order).
  - Chapter 5 must mention W.
  - Chapters 1, 6, and 7 can mention any of the remaining clues: R, S, and Z.
  
  We can eliminate choices A, C, and E because they mention R in chapter 1, S in chapter 7, and X in chapter 4, respectively, which are not possible according to the constraints.
  
  We are left with two choices:
  - B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  - D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  
  Both of these choices are possible, but we can eliminate choice D because it violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, the answer is B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The clues that must be mentioned are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

We know that U must be mentioned in chapter 3, and U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or chapter 4. This also means that W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. So, the earliest W can be mentioned is chapter 6. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 7. This leaves us with only one option.

Action: Answer("D")  
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven different clues, R, S, T, U, W, X, Z.
  - Each chapter from 1 to 7 will mention exactly one of the clues.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W.
  - There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3:
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T cannot be mentioned in chapters 1, 2, or 3.
  - U is mentioned in chapter 3, so X must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5, but that violates the rule that T must be mentioned before W. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - Since W is not mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, and there must be exactly two chapters between the mention of T and the mention of W, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and neither can be mentioned in chapters 6 or 7, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5.
  - That leaves only R to be mentioned in chapter 7.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are seven clues to be mentioned exactly once in seven chapters.
  T cannot be in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W.
  There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If U is in chapter 3, then X must be in chapter 2 or 4.
  Therefore, W cannot be in chapter 3 or 5 because otherwise, W and X would be adjacent.
  If W is in chapter 6, then T should be in chapter 4.
  If R is in chapter 1, then S must be in chapter 3 or 5, which is not allowed.
  If R is in chapter 5, then Z must be in chapter 7, which is allowed.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  There are seven chapters: chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, with two chapters separating them.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Solution:
If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be in chapter 4. 
Therefore, W cannot be in chapter 3 or chapter 5 since U and X have to be in adjacent chapters. 
T must be in chapter 2 or chapter 6. If T is in chapter 6, then W must be in chapter 4 which violates the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating T and W. Hence, T must be in chapter 2. This means that R cannot be in chapter 1. 
Therefore, the only valid option is:
Action: Answer("B") R is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  The novel has 7 chapters, and each chapter must mention exactly one clue.
  T cannot be in chapter 1, T must be before W, and there must be exactly 2 chapters between T and W.
  S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be in adjacent chapters.

Analyzing each choice:
  A: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 because every chapter must have a different clue.
  B: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 because every chapter must have a different clue.
  C: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then there are only two possible chapters left to mention S, which are chapters 4 and 6. Both of these violate the constraint that S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be in chapter 2, W must be in chapter 6 (because there must be exactly two chapters between T and W), and X must be in chapter 7 (because U and X must be in adjacent chapters). Therefore, W can be in chapter 6.
  E: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be in chapter 2, W must be in chapter 6, and X must be in chapter 7. Therefore, X can be in chapter 4.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Seven clues, R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z, each mentioned once, one per chapter.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1, and must be separated from W by exactly two chapters.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
We know that U is mentioned in chapter 3, which means chapter 2 and chapter 4 cannot mention U or X. This also means chapter 5 cannot mention U. 

A: If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, violating the constraint that T cannot be in chapter 1 and must be separated from W by exactly two chapters. So, A is not true.

B: If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be either in chapter 2 or 4, violating the constraint that T must be separated from W by exactly two chapters. So, B is not true.

C: S cannot be in chapter 6 or 8 (since Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters). Since we know that U is mentioned in chapter 3 and X must be adjacent to U, X must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4. Therefore, chapter 5 cannot be S. So, C is a possible scenario.

D: If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be in chapter 3 and X must be in chapter 4 (because T must be separated from W by exactly two chapters, and U is mentioned in chapter 3 and X must be adjacent to U). But this violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, D is not true.

E: If X is in chapter 4, then T must be in chapter 3 and W must be in chapter 6 (because T must be separated from W by exactly two chapters, and U is mentioned in chapter 3 and X must be adjacent to U). But this violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, E is not true.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The seven clues, R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z, will be mentioned exactly once, one per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. 
  T must be mentioned before W.
  There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: 
If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then clue X must be mentioned in chapter 4. 
If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 (because T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W). 
Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4. 
Also, S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 5.
So, the only option that could be true is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6. 
Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We are given that there are seven chapters in the novel, and the order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints:
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  We are told that U is mentioned in chapter 3.
  A: We don't know where R is mentioned, so it could be true or false. 
  B: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then either T or W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5. That means R could be mentioned in chapter 1 or 2, but not in chapter 5. So this could be true.
  C: We don't know where S is mentioned, so it could be true or false.
  D: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then either T or W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5. That means X could be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, but not in chapter 6. So this is false.
  E: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4. So this could be true. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - The novel consists of seven chapters.
  - Each of seven different clues is mentioned exactly once.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  Since we know that U is mentioned in chapter 3 and U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, we can deduce that X must be mentioned in chapter 4. Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, we know that W must be mentioned either in chapter 5 or chapter 6. Also, since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, we know that T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3. This means that S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapter 1 and chapter 7, but the order is unknown. Since R has not been assigned to any of the chapters yet, it could be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7. 

Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: Since R has not been assigned to any of the chapters yet, it could be mentioned in chapter 5. All the other answer choices are not possible based on the given constraints.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Let's analyze each option:
  A: Jiang, Kramer - This is not possible as per the given conditions because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  B: Kramer, O'Neill - This is correct as per the given conditions.
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill - This is not possible as per the given conditions because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill - This is not possible as there are only two students who review the same play or plays as each other.
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill - This is not possible as per the given conditions because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill must review Tamerlane. This eliminates options A, C, and E since they do not include O'Neill.

Using condition 3, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. This means that only one of the remaining options can be correct.

Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. There are no restrictions on Kramer and O'Neill.

Option B does not violate any of the conditions and is possible. Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, any accurate list must include Kramer and O'Neill.
- Only three plays are reviewed (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. So, the list must include at least two students.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. There are two possible pairs of students who could have reviewed the same play or plays as each other: {Kramer, O'Neill} and {Kramer, Megregian}.

Analysis:
- If Jiang reviewed Tamerlane, then neither Megregian nor Lopez could have reviewed it. That would mean Kramer and O'Neill are the only two who could have reviewed the same play or plays as each other. The list of students who review Tamerlane would be {Kramer, O'Neill}.
- If Jiang reviewed Sunset or Undulation, then either Kramer and O'Neill or Kramer and Megregian must have reviewed Tamerlane. The list of students who reviewed Tamerlane would be {Kramer, O'Neill} or {Kramer, Megregian}.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane.
  2. Jiang does not review any play that Lopez or Megregian reviewed.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each reviewed fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students reviewed the same play or plays.
  
Analysis:
  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, so they should appear in the answer. 
  We also know that exactly two of the students reviewed a common play.
  Based on the second point, we can eliminate options A and D since they only have one student reviewing Tamerlane.
  We can eliminate option E since it does not contain Kramer, who was confirmed to review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or C.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we can eliminate options A and E because neither of them includes O'Neill who reviews Tamerlane.

Option C violates condition 2 as Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, but Lopez cannot review Tamerlane as per condition 1.

Option D violates condition 3 as Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer, but the option shows Kramer reviewing more plays than Megregian.

Option B satisfies all the given conditions. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and they are the only two who review the same play. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The students who review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  Option A includes only two students while the prompt states "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other." 
  Option B is a possibility because Kramer and O'Neill were mentioned to have reviewed Tamerlane.
  Option C includes three students while the prompt states "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other." 
  Option D includes three students while the prompt states "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other." 
  Option E includes three students while the prompt states "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other." 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Process of elimination:
  - Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they must be two of the students in the group of two that reviews the same play.
  - If Jiang were the other student to review Tamerlane, then Megregian would have to review Sunset and Undulation, and Lopez would have to review only one play, which violates condition 2 and 4.
  - If Megregian were the other student to review Tamerlane, then he would have to review only one other play, which would have to be Sunset or Undulation. This would violate condition 4 because either Kramer or Lopez would have to review fewer plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian cannot be in the group of two students who review the same play.
  - If Lopez were the other student to review Tamerlane, then he would have to review only one other play, which would have to be Sunset or Undulation. This would violate condition 4 because either Kramer or Megregian would have to review fewer plays than Lopez. Therefore, Lopez cannot be in the group of two students who review the same play.
  
Action: Answer("D") - Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using condition 1, we know that Kramer and O'Neill must be in the list. 
Using condition 4, we know that there are exactly two students who review exactly the same play. Therefore, there are only two possible combinations for the students who review Tamerlane: 
   1) Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane; or
   2) Kramer reviews Tamerlane with another student who is not Lopez or Megregian, and O'Neill reviews Tamerlane with Lopez or Megregian.
Using condition 2, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot be the student who reviews Tamerlane with Kramer.
Using condition 3, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Kramer cannot review Tamerlane with Lopez, as it would violate condition 3.
Thus, the only possible combination is that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Using (4), we can conclude that exactly two students review Tamerlane. 
Using (1), we know that Kramer and O'Neill are among those two students. 
Therefore, we need to select one more student that reviews Tamerlane from the remaining students who do not review any play Jiang reviews and reviewed fewer plays than Megregian.

Option (E) is not valid because all three students reviewed more plays than Megregian. 

Option (D) is not valid because Megregian is already reviewing Tamerlane. 

Option (C) is not valid because Lopez reviewed more plays than Megregian. 

Option (A) is not valid because Jiang reviewed Tamerlane. 

Therefore, the only valid option is (B) Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analyzing the answer choices:
  A: Jiang and Kramer cannot both review Tamerlane as per statement 2.
  B: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane as per statement 1. This choice is a possibility.
  C: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane as per statement 1. Lopez cannot review Tamerlane as per statement 2. This choice is not a possibility.
  D: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane as per statement 1. Megregian cannot review Tamerlane as per statement 2. This choice is not a possibility.
  E: Lopez cannot review Tamerlane as per statement 2. Megregian and O'Neill both review Tamerlane as per statement 1. This choice is not a possibility.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Question: The organizer must at least select
Choices:
  A: one French novel and one French play
  B: one French novel and one Russian play
  C: one Russian novel and one French play
  D: two French novels
  E: two Russian novels
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The organizer must select between 5 and 6 works from a group of 9 works.
  The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
  The organizer must select no more than 4 French works.
  The organizer must select at least 3 but no more than 4 novels.
  The organizer must select at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Analysis:
  In order to satisfy the requirement of selecting no more than four French works, the organizer must select at least one Russian work.
  In order to satisfy the requirement of selecting at least 3 but no more than 4 novels, the organizer must select at least one more novel, regardless of the combination of works already selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, which means that the organizer must select at least one French novel instead.

Action: Answer("D")  
The organizer must select at least two French novels to satisfy the requirement of selecting no more than four French works while also selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The organizer must select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works.
  The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
  No more than 4 French works can be selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Solving the problem:
  We need to select at least 5 works from a group of 9 works with certain constraints. Let's analyze each option:
  A: If we select one French novel and one French play, we still need to select at least one more novel. Also, we can select at most one more French work, so we cannot select both French plays. This option does not meet the constraints.
  B: If we select one French novel and one Russian play, we still need to select at least one more novel. Also, we can select at most one more French work, so we cannot select both French plays. This option does not meet the constraints.
  C: If we select one Russian novel and one French play, we still need to select at least one more novel. Also, we can select at most one more French work, so we cannot select both French plays. This option does not meet the constraints.
  D: If we select two French novels, we can select at most one more French work, which can be a French play or a French novel. We also need to select at least one Russian novel and one more novel. This option meets the constraints.
  E: If we select two Russian novels, we can select at most two more Russian works, which can be a Russian novel or the Russian play. We also need to select at least one French novel and one more novel. This option meets the constraints.
  
Therefore, the answer is either D or E. However, we need to select the answer that meets the condition of selecting at least 3 but no more than 4 novels. Option D selects only 2 novels, so the only valid option is E. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The organizer must select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works, consisting of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
  No more than 4 French works can be selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Solving:
- At least 3 novels must be selected. 
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected, so either two French novels and one Russian novel or two Russian novels and one French novel must be selected.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, so at most one French play can be selected.
- No more than 4 French works can be selected, so at most 3 French novels and 1 French play can be selected.

Trying the options:
- Option A: one French novel and one French play: violates the constraint that at least 3 novels must be selected.
- Option B: one French novel and one Russian play: violates the constraint that at least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected.
- Option C: one Russian novel and one French play: violates the constraint that at least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected.
- Option D: two French novels: satisfies all the constraints and selects at least 3 novels, so it is a possible selection.
- Option E: two Russian novels: satisfies all the constraints and selects at least 3 novels, so it is a possible selection.

Conclusion: Both D and E are possible selections, but they do not determine the exact number of works selected. Since the question asks for the minimum number of works that must be selected, we cannot choose between D and E. Therefore, none of the options is correct.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The organizer will select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works, consisting of:
  - 3 French novels
  - 3 Russian novels
  - 2 French plays
  - 1 Russian play
  No more than 4 French works can be selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

To satisfy all the requirements, the organizer must select at least:
- one French novel and one Russian novel (to have at least three novels with at least as many French novels as Russian novels)
- one French play OR one Russian play (to have no more than four French works and to satisfy the French plays condition)
- one additional work, which can be any of the remaining works
  
Since the organizer must select at least one French novel, one Russian novel, and one play, and there are no options with all three, the best choice is the one that satisfies the minimum requirements.

Action: Answer("A") - one French novel and one French play
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The organizer must select at least three but no more than four novels.
  The organizer must select at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
  The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play.
  
Elimination:
  A: The organizer could select one French novel, but there are no other requirements met.
  B: The organizer could select one French novel and one Russian play, but there are no other requirements met.
  C: The organizer could select one Russian novel and one French play, but there are no other requirements met.
  D: The organizer could select two French novels, which satisfies all three requirements.
  E: The organizer could select two Russian novels, but there are no other requirements met.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
The organizer must select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works. 
The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
No more than 4 French works are selected.
At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Analysis:
To satisfy the selection requirements, the organizer has to select at least three novels, with at least as many French novels as Russian novels. Since there are three French and three Russian novels, the organizer must select at least one French novel and one Russian novel, which accounts for two works. The organizer can then select one or two French plays (since no more than four French works can be selected) and one or two other French or Russian novels. 

Action: Answer("A") 
The organizer must at least select one French novel and one French play. This selection satisfies the requirement of at least one French novel and no more than two French plays. However, the organizer must also select at least one Russian novel to satisfy the requirement of at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The organizer will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works.
  - The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play.
  - The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements:
    - No more than four French works are selected.
    - At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
    - At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
    - If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

There are different possible combinations of works that meet the requirements. However, we can determine the minimum number of works that the organizer must select by following the requirements:
- At least three novels are selected.
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
- No more than four French works are selected.

One possible selection that meets these requirements is:
- Three French novels
- Two Russian novels
- One French play

This selection has a total of six works, which is the maximum allowed. Therefore, the minimum number of works that the organizer must select is six.

Option A (one French novel and one French play) does not meet the requirement of having at least three novels.
Option B (one French novel and one Russian play) does not meet the requirement of having at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
Option C (one Russian novel and one French play) does not meet the requirement of having at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
Option D (two French novels) meets the requirements, but is not the minimum number of works that the organizer must select.
Option E (two Russian novels) meets the requirements, but is not the minimum number of works that the organizer must select.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The organizer must select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works.
  The group consists of:
    - 3 French novels
    - 3 Russian novels
    - 2 French plays
    - 1 Russian play
  No more than 4 French works are selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Solution:
  From the given options, D: Two French novels, seems the only one that fits within the given constraints. 
  If we have to select at least 3 novels, and we can have no more than 4 French works, we can select two French novels and two Russian novels, so that we have 4 novels with at least as many French novels as Russian novels. 
  We can select one French play and one Russian play, as we cannot have both French plays selected, and this brings our total to 6 works. 
  Therefore, we must select at least two French novels, one French play, one Russian novel, and one Russian play. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The organizer must select at least 5 works, and at most 6 works, from a group of 9 works.
  - The group consists of:
    - 3 French novels
    - 3 Russian novels
    - 2 French plays
    - 1 Russian play
  - The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements:
    - No more than 4 French works are selected.
    - At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
    - At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
    - If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Analysis:
  - Let's consider the worst-case scenario, where the organizer selects 5 works and the 4 French works are selected.
  - Since at least 3 novels must be selected, and there are only 3 Russian novels available, all 3 Russian novels must be selected.
  - At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected, so at least 3 French novels must be selected.
  - If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, so the organizer can select at most one French play.
  - Therefore, the organizer must select:
    - 3 French novels
    - 2 Russian novels
    - at most 1 French play
    - for a total of 5 works.
  - Note that this satisfies all of the requirements.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The organizer must select at least five but at most six works out of nine works.
  The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play.
  No more than four French works are selected.
  At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Elimination:
- Choice A is incorrect because the organizer is not required to select a French play.
- Choice B is incorrect because the organizer is not required to select a Russian play.
- Choice C is incorrect because the organizer is not required to select a Russian novel.
- Choice D may be correct because the organizer must select at least one and at most three French novels. However, this is not the minimum requirement.
- Choice E may be correct because the organizer must select at least one and at most three Russian novels. However, this is not the minimum requirement.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The hearing takes exactly three days, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on only one day of the hearing.
  Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.
  Iturbe must testify on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday.
  Hong cannot testify on Monday.
  At least one witness must testify on Monday.

Solution:
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Tuesday since two witnesses already testified on that day. 
  Hong must therefore testify on Monday.
  Since Hong cannot testify on Monday, Franco cannot testify on Monday either since they testify on the same day.
  Therefore, Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, so Iturbe is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  Garcia cannot testify on Wednesday since only one witness is scheduled to testify on that day, and iturbe already will testify on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  
Answer: Answer("C") Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  Testimony takes place on three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco testifies on the day different from Garcia.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday. 
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Hong does not testify on Tuesday.
  
  A: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Tuesday. This means that Hong can only testify on Monday or Wednesday. However, Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday. However, Iturbe already testifies on Wednesday, so this option is not possible.
  B: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, and Hong testifies on Wednesday, then Franco can only testify on Monday or Tuesday. However, at least one witness must testify on Monday, which means that Franco cannot testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday, and Garcia cannot testify on Monday because Garcia does not testify on the same day as Franco. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday. This option is possible.
  C: Same as option A, we know that Hong must testify on Wednesday. However, Iturbe already testifies on Wednesday, so this option is not possible.
  D: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong must testify on Wednesday and Franco must testify on Monday. This means that Jackson and Garcia must testify on Tuesday. However, we know that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so this option is not possible.
  E: Same as option A, we know that Hong must testify on Wednesday. However, Iturbe already testifies on Wednesday, so this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is three days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  - If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Jackson must testify on Monday and Garcia and Hong must testify on Wednesday. This would be a valid schedule that meets all of the conditions. Therefore, A, B, C, and D are not necessarily true of the schedule.
  - If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe must testify on Tuesday. We know that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so the other witness on Tuesday would have to be either Garcia, Hong, or Jackson. However, Garcia and Hong cannot testify on the same day, so Jackson would have to testify on Tuesday. This would mean that Garcia testifies on Monday, which would be a valid schedule that meets all of the conditions.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  -There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  -The hearing will take place over 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  -Each witness testifies on exactly 1 day of the hearing.
  -Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  -Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  -Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  -Hong does not testify on Monday.
  -At least 1 witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday. This means that at least two witnesses testify on Monday, and since Hong does not testify on Monday, it must be Garcia and someone else. Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday and Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, this means that Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - Testify on three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on one day only.
  - Franco != Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong != Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday since Hong doesn't testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
Case 1: Franco testifies on Tuesday.
Then, Garcia must testify on Monday because Franco != Garcia. Hong does not testify on Monday, so Hong must testify on Wednesday. Iturbe cannot testify on Tuesday because there are already two witnesses scheduled to testify on Tuesday. Thus, Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. Jackson must testify on Monday since at least one witness should testify on Monday. This schedule satisfies all of the given conditions.
Case 2: Franco testifies on Wednesday.
Then, Iturbe must testify on Tuesday because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Hong must testify on Monday since Hong does not testify on Wednesday. Garcia must testify on Tuesday since Franco != Garcia. Jackson must testify on Monday since at least one witness should testify on Monday. This schedule satisfies all of the given conditions.

Since both cases are possible and satisfy all of the given conditions, none of the choices must be true.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five witnesses, they testify once, and on one of the three days Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Franco and Garcia do not testify on the same day.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong will testify on either Monday or Tuesday.
  
  A: If Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, then Hong cannot testify on Monday or Tuesday because if he did, then Franco and Hong would testify on the same day, which is not allowed. This means that Hong would have to testify on Wednesday, but Iturbe has to testify on Wednesday, so this could not be the case. Therefore, this statement is false.
  
  B: If Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday, then Franco cannot testify on Monday, and since Iturbe has to testify on Wednesday, Franco would have to testify on Tuesday along with Hong. However, we know that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, which means that Garcia would have to testify on Tuesday as well, which is not allowed because Garcia must not testify on the same day as Franco. Therefore, this statement is false.
  
  C: If Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, then Franco cannot testify on Wednesday because Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. This means that Franco would have to testify on Tuesday along with Hong, but we know that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, which means that Garcia would have to testify on Tuesday as well, which is not allowed because Garcia must not testify on the same day as Franco. Therefore, this statement is false.
  
  D: If Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday, then Franco would have to testify on Tuesday as well. This would mean that Garcia would have to testify on Monday, which is allowed. Iturbe would then have to testify on Wednesday, which is also allowed. Therefore, this statement could be true.
  
  E: If Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday, then Franco and Hong must testify on Monday and Tuesday, but we know that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, which means that they both cannot testify on Tuesday. Therefore, this statement is false.
 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Franco is not scheduled to testify on the same day as Garcia.
  2. Iturbe is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong is not scheduled to testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

Reasoning:
  1. If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday (from 4).
  2. Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  3. If Hong testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia must testify on Monday (from 1 and 5), which means that Iturbe cannot testify on Tuesday (from 2 and 3).
  4. Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday, which means Iturbe must testify on Tuesday (from 2 and 3).
  5. This leaves Franco and Garcia to testify on Monday, which satisfies all of the conditions.

Action: Answer("C") 
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 5 witnesses (Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson) scheduled to testify.
  - The hearing is exactly 3 days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day.
  - Franco != Garcia
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco or Hong. Therefore, Garcia must testify either on Monday or on Wednesday. However, if Garcia testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday, which contradicts the given condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday. That means Hong cannot testify on Monday (because Hong does not testify on Monday), so Hong must testify on Tuesday and Franco and Iturbe must testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia must testify on Wednesday, but this is not possible since Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Wednesday, and Garcia must testify on Monday. Iturbe's testimony must occur on Tuesday. Hong's testimony must occur on Tuesday. Therefore, Jackson's testimony must occur on Monday. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing takes place over exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day.
  Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis: 
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then we know that Franco cannot testify on Monday since Hong doesn't testify on Monday. Therefore, Franco and Hong must be testifying on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, we know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday. This also means that Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday since Franco is not scheduled to testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday, and Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. 

Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, if Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Garcia must be scheduled to testify on Wednesday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the auditions, from first to last?
Choices:
  A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida
  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
  C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida
  D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
  E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. 
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. 
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
A: Kammer is before Trillo, and the fifth audition must be recorded so it cannot be Trillo, but Trillo can only come after Kammer. Zinn must come before Yoshida, and the fourth audition cannot be recorded so it cannot be Zinn, but Zinn can only come before Yoshida. Therefore, the order cannot be Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, or Yoshida. Lugo can be before or after Waite, which means that Waite can be 1st or 2nd. Therefore, A is not correct.
B: Waite must be before the two recorded auditions, and
Kammer must be before Trillo, which means that Waite must be 1st or 2nd, Kammer must be 1st or 2nd, but Lugo cannot be before Kammer and Trillo cannot be before Kammer. Therefore, B is not correct.
C: Waite must be before the two recorded auditions, and Kammer must be before Trillo, which means that Waite must be 1st or 2nd, and Kammer must be 1st or 2nd. Yoshida must be last, and Zinn must be before Yoshida. This leaves Trillo to be 4th and Lugo to be 3rd. Therefore, the possible order is Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida. 
D: The order starts with Waite, and Kammer must be before Trillo, but Zinn cannot be before Waite. Therefore, D is not correct.
E: Zinn must be before Yoshida, and the fifth audition must be recorded so it cannot be Yoshida. Therefore, E is not correct.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- There are six singers auditioning in a specific order.
- Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
- The fifth audition must be recorded.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analysis:
- According to the rules, the order of the auditions should be as follows:
    1. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Therefore, either Waite goes first or second.
    2. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, if Kammer goes third, then Trillo must go fourth (which is not possible because the fourth audition cannot be recorded). So, if Kammer goes third, then Trillo must go fifth, which means the fifth audition will be recorded. Therefore, Kammer cannot go third. If Kammer goes fourth, then Trillo must go fifth, which means the fifth audition will be recorded. Therefore, Kammer cannot go fourth. Therefore, Kammer must go first or second.
    3. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, if Zinn goes fourth, then Yoshida must go fifth (which is not possible because the fifth audition must be recorded). So, if Zinn goes fourth, then Yoshida must go sixth, which means either Kammer or Lugo, whose auditions are going to be recorded, must go fifth (which is not possible because the fifth audition must be recorded). Therefore, Zinn cannot go fourth. If Zinn goes fifth or sixth, then Yoshida must go sixth (which is not possible because the fifth audition must be recorded). Therefore, Zinn must go first, second, or third.
    4. The fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, either Waite, Kammer, Lugo, or Zinn must go fourth.

Options Analysis:
A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida
- Kammer cannot go second because Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
- Trillo cannot go fourth because Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- Zinn cannot go third because Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- Waite cannot go fourth because the fourth audition cannot be recorded.
- Therefore, this option is not possible.

B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
- This option satisfies all the rules.
- Action: Answer("B")

C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida
- Kammer cannot go third because Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
- Trillo cannot go fourth because Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- Yoshida cannot go sixth because the fifth audition must be recorded.
- Therefore, this option is not possible.

D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
- Kammer cannot go third because Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
- Trillo cannot go fourth because Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- Lugo cannot go fifth because the fifth audition must be recorded.
- Therefore, this option is not possible.

E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo
- Kammer cannot go second because Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
- Trillo cannot go sixth because the fifth audition must be recorded.
- Therefore, this option is not possible. 

Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Elimination: 
  Option A violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition
  Option B violates the condition that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition
  Option C violates the condition that Kammer's audition must be recorded
  Option D satisfies all the conditions and could be a possible order of the auditions.
  Option E violates the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- There are six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
- Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded.
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
- The fifth audition must be recorded.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analysis:
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth one must be recorded. Therefore, the order of auditions must be either: _ _ _ 4 _ 5 or _ _ _ 5 _ 4.
- The fifth audition is recorded, so it must take place after Waite's audition.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, meaning Kammer's audition must take place before the fourth audition.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida - This order places Kammer's audition after the fourth audition, which violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Also, Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, which is not the case in this order. Therefore, this order is not possible.
B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo - This order satisfies all the conditions given, so it is a possible order.
C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida - This order violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so it is not possible.
D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida - This order violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so it is not possible.
E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo - This order violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so it is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a valid order for the auditions that satisfies all the given conditions.
  Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded. Others will not be recorded.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded. 
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Eliminating Choices:
  A: Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so this order is not valid. Eliminate.
  B: This order satisfies all the given conditions. Keep as a valid choice.
  C: The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so this order is not valid. Eliminate.
  D: Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so this order is not valid. Eliminate.
  E: Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so this order is not valid. Eliminate.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  2. The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  3. The fifth audition must be recorded.
  4. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  5. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  6. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Using the given rules, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
- Choice A: Kammer's audition cannot be the first since her audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded. However, Lugo's audition cannot be the first either due to rule 4. Therefore, this answer choice violates the rules.
- Choice C: This answer choice violates rule 5 since Trillo's audition is before Kammer's audition.
- Choice E: This answer choice violates rule 4 since Waite's audition should take place before the recorded auditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is either B or D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
- The fifth audition must be recorded.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analysis:
- Waite's audition must take place first or second, and the fifth audition must be either Kammer or Lugo.
- Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, the fourth audition must be one of the unrecorded ones, which means that Waite's audition must take place first.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, which means Kammer's audition must be second or third.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, which means Zinn's audition must be first or second.
- Since the fifth audition must be recorded and Waite's audition must be before the recorded ones, Kammer's audition must be the fifth.
- Lugo's audition must be one of the unrecorded ones, which means Lugo's audition must either be first or fourth.

Action: Answer("D") 
- The order that satisfies all the given conditions is Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida. So the answer is D.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.

  - Choice B: This order satisfies all the conditions.
  - Choice C: Lugo's audition is before Kammer's audition, which violates one of the conditions.
  - Choice D: Waite's audition is before Zinn's audition which violates one of the conditions.
  - Choice E: Zinn's audition is before Waite's audition which violates one of the conditions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find the order of the auditions based on a set of conditions.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Elimination:
  A: Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so A is incorrect as Trillo's audition is before Kammer's.
  B: This order satisfies all the conditions, so it could be a possible order.
  C: Waite's audition needs to happen before the two recorded auditions, but this order places his audition after Lugo's, which is recorded. So, C is incorrect.
  D: Zinn's audition needs to happen before Yoshida's audition, but this order places his audition after Lugo's, which is recorded. So, D is incorrect.
  E: There is no condition satisfied by this order. Zinn's audition must happen before Yoshida's audition, but this order places Zinn's audition after Yoshida's. So, E is incorrect.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A corporate manager is selecting employees for a research team. The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. The selection is constrained by the following conditions: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team?
Choices:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt
  B: Ortega and Wong
  C: Paine and Schmidt
  D: Thomson and Yoder
  E: Yoder and Zayre
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees from the eight given employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  
Analysis:
  To identify the pair of employees, we need to combine the constraints given for each employee and see which pair is mandatory. 
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Therefore, Myers and Wong are mandatory employees in the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Therefore, Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson are mandatory employees in the team.
  Therefore, the mandatory pairs of employees on the team are Ortega and Wong OR Schmidt, Paine and Thomson.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find a pair of employees that must be on the team.
  Myers cannot be on the team with Ortega or Paine.
  Schmidt must be on the team with Paine and Thomson.
  Wong must be on the team with Myers and Yoder.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, if Wong is not selected, then Myers and Yoder are not selected. This means that either Myers or Ortega or Paine can be selected. However, we already know that Ortega and Paine cannot be selected if Myers is on the team. Therefore, Myers must be selected. This means that Yoder must also be selected. Therefore, the pair of Wong and Myers (B) must be on the team.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. 
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. 
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Analysis:
  If we select Myers, then we can't select Ortega or Paine. If we select Wong, we must select Myers and Yoder. So, either Myers or Wong must be on the team. 
  If we select Schmidt, then we must select both Paine and Thomson. 
  Therefore, either Myers or Wong is on the team and if Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  So, the possible pairs of employees are: 
    - Ortega and Wong (if Wong is selected, then Myers and Yoder must be on the team)
    - Paine and Thomson (if Schmidt is selected, then both Paine and Thomson must be on the team)
    - Thomson and Yoder (if Wong is selected, then Myers and Yoder must be on the team)

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The team must have at least 4 members out of 8 employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
- If Myers is selected, Ortega and Paine cannot be selected.
- If Schmidt is selected, Paine and Thomson must be selected.
- If Wong is selected, Myers and Yoder must be selected.

Analysis:
- To select a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team, we need to consider the constraints given and verify which pairs cannot be selected.
- Ortega and Schmidt cannot be selected together because if Schmidt is selected, Paine must also be selected, and if Paine is selected, Ortega cannot be selected.
- Wong and Yoder cannot be selected together because if Wong is selected, Myers and Yoder must also be selected, and Yoder cannot be selected again.

Action: Answer("D") 
- Thomson and Yoder is the only pair left that has not been excluded by the constraints and at least one of them must be on the team.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. 
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. 
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Ortega is on the team, Myers cannot be on the team. 
  If Wong is on the team, Myers must be on the team. 
  Therefore, either Ortega or Wong must be on the team. 
  Hence, the answer is (B) Ortega and Wong.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are eight employees available to be selected for the team: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is selected, then either Ortega or Paine (but not both) can be selected.
  If Schmidt is selected, then both Paine and Thomson must also be selected.
  If Wong is selected, then both Myers and Yoder must also be selected.
  
Elimination:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt cannot both be on the team, since if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Thus, Ortega and Schmidt cannot be a pair of employees on the team.
  B: If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Ortega is not included in this condition, so Ortega and Wong could be a pair of employees on the team.
  C: If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Thus, Paine and Schmidt cannot both be a pair of employees on the team.
  D: Thomson can be on the team without Yoder, so Thomson and Yoder do not have to be a pair on the team.
  E: Zayre is not included in any of the conditions for selecting the team. Thus, Yoder and Zayre could be a pair of employees on the team.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The team must have at least four members.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Reasoning:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. This means that if Ortega is not on the team, then Myers must be. Same for Paine. 
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. This means that if Schmidt is not on the team, then Paine and Thomson cannot be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. This means that if Wong is not on the team, then Myers and Yoder cannot be on the team.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Wong must be on the team, which means Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, Ortega and Wong make a pair of employees, at least one of whom must be on the team.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The team will include at least four employees selected from eight employees.
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must be on the team as well. This means there are at least three employees already on the team: Wong, Myers, and Yoder. This leaves only five employees to fill the remaining spot(s): Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, and Zayre. 
  We are looking for a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team. The only pair that fits this condition is Ortega and Wong. They are the only two employees on the list that have not already been included on the team. Therefore, Answer("B") is correct.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  - If Ortega is on the team, Schmidt cannot be on the team, because Ortega and Schmidt cannot be on the team together.
  - If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team, so Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team.
  - Therefore, the only pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Thomson and Yoder because if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team, and if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a total of eight employees.
  Conditions:
    - If Myers is selected, Ortega and Paine cannot be selected.
    - If Schmidt is selected, Paine and Thomson must also be selected.
    - If Wong is selected, Myers and Yoder must also be selected.
    
Analysis:
  To form such a pair, we need to ensure that at least one of the pair is on the team. Let's examine each option:
  A) Ortega and Schmidt - If Schmidt is selected, then Paine and Thomson must also be selected, and Ortega would not be able to be selected. Similarly, if Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine can be selected. Therefore, this pair cannot be guaranteed to have at least one employee on the team.
  B) Ortega and Wong - If Wong is selected, then Myers and Yoder must also be selected, and Ortega would not be able to be selected. Therefore, this pair cannot be guaranteed to have at least one employee on the team.
  C) Paine and Schmidt - If Schmidt is selected, then Paine and Thomson must also be selected. This guarantees the presence of Paine on the team. Therefore, this pair can be guaranteed to have at least one employee on the team.
  D) Thomson and Yoder - There are no conditions on Thomson and Yoder, so either or both could be on the team. Therefore, this pair can be guaranteed to have at least one employee on the team.
  E) Yoder and Zayre - There are no conditions on Yoder and Zayre, so either or both could be on the team. Therefore, this pair can be guaranteed to have at least one employee on the team.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The rules are: 
  - Young > Togowa
  - Xu > Souza
  - Robertson > Young
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
  A: Young > Togowa is violated, Xu > Souza is violated, Robertson > Young is violated, and Robertson can't be assigned parking space #5 or #6. So, A is not possible.
  B: Robertson must be assigned one of the parking spaces #1, #2, #3, or #4 and in option B, Robertson is assigned parking space #5. So, B is not possible.
  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #4 which is valid according to the rules. Young > Togowa is also valid since Togowa is assigned parking space #1. Xu > Souza is also valid since Souza is assigned parking space #5. So, C is possible.
  D: Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and in option D, Robertson is assigned parking space #2. So, D is not possible.
  E: Robertson is assigned parking space #4 which is valid according to the rules. Young > Togowa is also valid since Togowa is assigned parking space #2. Xu > Souza is also valid since Souza is assigned parking space #1. So, E is possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The rules dictate the following order of assignment: 
    Robertson > Young > Togowa
    Xu > Souza
    Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
    Each employee must be assigned a unique parking space. 
Analysis:
  We know from the rules that Robertson must be assigned one of the first four parking spaces. 
  From the answer choices, the only option that satisfies that rule is Option D. 
  We can then check the other rules to ensure that it is a valid assignment:
    - Togowa is assigned #1, which means Young (who must have a higher-numbered parking space) must be assigned #2 or #3. 
    - From the answer choice, Young is assigned #3, which means Togowa is assigned #1.
    - Xu must have a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and they must be assigned #5 and #6 in some order. 
    - From the answer choice, Xu is assigned #6 and Souza is assigned #4, which satisfies the rule. 
    - Vaughn is assigned #5 in the answer choice, which is not in conflict with any of the rules. 
Conclusion: 
  Therefore, the valid assignment of parking spaces is Option D. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The rules state that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4. 
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Young must be assigned parking space #3, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. 
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. 
  All six employees must be assigned different parking spaces.
  
Analysis:
  From the rules, we know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #3. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #5, and Souza must be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Additionally, Xu must be assigned parking space #6. 
  Among the answer choices, only option D has Robertson assigned parking space #4, Young assigned parking space #3, Togowa assigned parking space #5, and Xu assigned parking space #6. Souza is assigned parking space #4, and Vaughn is assigned parking space #2. This arrangement satisfies all of the given conditions. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 

A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
- Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so this is incorrect.
B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
- This could be a possible solution and it satisfies the rules given.
C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
- Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so this is incorrect.
D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so this is incorrect.
E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
- Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so this is incorrect.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
- Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.

A: Young is assigned parking space #1, which violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. 
B: Robertson is assigned parking space #5, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
C: This assignment satisfies all the given rules.

- Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
- Each employee must be assigned one parking space.
- No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.

Analysis:
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so option A cannot be correct.
- In option B, Robertson is assigned parking space #5, which is incorrect. Additionally, Young is assigned parking space #3, which violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- In option C, Robertson's parking space is correct, and the order of Young and Togowa is also correct. However, Xu is assigned parking space #3, which violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- In option D, Robertson's parking space is correct, and the order of Young and Togowa is also correct. Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and each employee is assigned a unique parking space. Thus, option D is the correct answer.
- In option E, Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  
Analysis:
  From the rules given, we know that Robertson must have parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6. So, options A and E are eliminated. Also, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6. So, option B is eliminated. Looking at option C, Togowa has to be assigned parking space #1 or #2, but that would violate the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. So, option C is also eliminated. That leaves us with only option D.
  
Action: Answer("D")

Knowledge: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned, then Louis and Mollie cannot both be assigned since there is only one available spot for each year.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  The remaining student is either Louis or Tiffany.
Analysis:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Onyx must be assigned to 1922. 
  Since Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923, and Louis cannot be assigned to 1922, the only remaining option for Mollie is 1921 and the only remaining option for Louis/Tiffany is 1923. 
  Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to the project. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis and Mollie cannot be assigned to the project. 
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. 
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  A: Louis cannot be assigned to the project if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to it.
  B: Mollie cannot be assigned to the project if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to it.
  C: Onyx could be assigned to 1922 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project. 
  D: Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1924 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project because in this case, Ryan must be assigned to the project and he cannot be assigned to any year after 1923, which means Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1924. 
  E: Yoshio could be assigned to 1922 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  We need to assign four students to four different years from 1921 to 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then one of the following must be true:
  - Ryan is assigned to 1921, and Onyx is assigned to 1920 (the year immediately prior to 1921), leaving the years 1922, 1923, and 1924 for the other four students to be assigned to. Yoshio can be assigned to any of these years.
  - Ryan is assigned to 1922, and Onyx is assigned to 1921, leaving the years 1921, 1923, and 1924 for the other four students to be assigned to. However, we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, leaving Louis to be assigned to either 1921 or 1924. Yoshio can be assigned to the remaining year (either 1921 or 1924).
  - Ryan is assigned to 1924, and Onyx is assigned to 1923. However, we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, leaving Louis to be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Yoshio can be assigned to the remaining year (either 1921 or 1922).
  
  A: Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Ryan and Yoshio are both assigned to the project, so this choice is not true.
  B: This choice is possible. Mollie can be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, leaving the other year for Louis or Tiffany, and leaving the remaining two years for Ryan, Onyx, and Yoshio to be assigned to.
  C: This choice is not possible. If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1921, leaving only Mollie, Louis, Tiffany, and Yoshio to be assigned to the remaining two years. However, we know that Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, so there is no way to assign all four students to the remaining two years.
  D: This choice is not possible. If Tiffany is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's (1923). However, we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so there is no way to assign all four students to the remaining two years.
  E: This choice is possible. If Yoshio is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1921, leaving only Mollie, Louis, Tiffany, and Onyx to be assigned to the remaining two years. We know that Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so there is a way to assign all four students to the remaining two years.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project.
  
Elimination: 
  If Ryan and Yoshio are both assigned to the project, and Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, then Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922 because there is no year immediately prior to those years. So, Yoshio must be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
  With Yoshio assigned to either 1923 or 1924 and Onyx assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, Louis could be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis being assigned to 1923 is a possible scenario.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  
Analysis:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project. According to the condition "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923", Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Tiffany is assigned to the project, which means Tiffany should be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. According to the condition "If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's", Onyx should be assigned to 1922. Then, Mollie must be assigned to 1921. Finally, Yoshio should be assigned to 1924.
  
Solution:
  Louis is not assigned to any year.
  Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
  Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to 1924.
  
Therefore, the answer is (D) None of the above.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project, and Ryan must be assigned to a year. Therefore, the only possible year that Louis can be assigned to is 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she can only be assigned to 1921 or 1922. However, Tiffany must be assigned to the project, which means Ryan must be assigned as well, and there is only one slot available for Ryan. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to the project. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, and Onyx must be assigned to 1922, leaving no more slots for Yoshio. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. The project requires assigning four students to work on the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  2. Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  3. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  4. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  5. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: Answer("C")
Explanation: 
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Thus, Ryan must be assigned either to 1922 or 1923, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921 or 1922 respectively.
- If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then we know that Yoshio can't be assigned to 1921 or 1922 since Mollie must be assigned to one of those years. Therefore, Yoshio must be assigned to either 1923 or 1924.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922. However, this would mean that Yoshio is assigned to 1924, which contradicts the previous conclusion that Yoshio must be assigned to either 1923 or 1924. Therefore, Tiffany can't be assigned to 1923.
- If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany can't be assigned to the project, and Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922. However, this would mean that Yoshio is assigned to 1924, which contradicts the previous conclusion that Yoshio must be assigned to either 1923 or 1924. Therefore, Louis can't be assigned to 1923.
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then we can assign Onyx to 1922, Ryan to 1923, and Yoshio to 1924. This satisfies all of the conditions, so Mollie could be assigned to 1921.
- If Tiffany is assigned to 1924, then we can assign Ryan to 1923, Louis to 1922, and Mollie to 1921. However, this would mean that Yoshio isn't assigned to the project, which contradicts the previous conclusion that Yoshio must be assigned to either 1923 or 1924. Therefore, Tiffany can't be assigned to 1924. 
- Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  We are given six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  We are given four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Each student will be assigned to one year.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then there are only two students left to be assigned to the two remaining years. Also, Ryan is assigned to one of the years. From the rule that if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, we know that Onyx must be assigned to the year prior to the year that Ryan is assigned to. Therefore, the only years that Onyx can be assigned to are 1921 or 1922, depending on which year Mollie is assigned to. If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922, and vice versa. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The assignment of years is as follows: 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany are not assigned to the project.
  Yoshio can be assigned to 1922 or 1924.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  
Analysis:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then there are only two possibilities:
  1) Ryan is assigned to 1922, and Yoshio is assigned to 1923.
  2) Yoshio is assigned to 1921, and Ryan is assigned to 1922.
  
  If Ryan is assigned to 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to 1921. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922. Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. However, if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. In this scenario, Ryan cannot be assigned to the same year as Yoshio. Thus, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923. Since Louis is the only other option for 1923, Louis must be assigned to 1923. Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 because Yoshio is already assigned to 1921. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922. This leaves Onyx to be assigned to 1924, which satisfies the condition that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. 
  Therefore, the only possibility is Louis-1923, Mollie-1922, Yoshio-1921, and Onyx-1924.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six lab sessions: three morning sessions and three afternoon sessions, one for each day of the week.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then: 
    * Kevin and Rebecca must lead their sessions on either Wednesday or Friday. 
    * Lan and Olivia cannot lead their sessions on Thursday.
  
Possible approach:
We can try to assign the lab assistants to the sessions according to the given constraints and see which assignments are possible if Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.

- Wednesday morning: (empty slot)
- Wednesday afternoon: Kevin or Rebecca
- Thursday morning: (empty slot)
- Thursday afternoon: Julio
- Friday morning: Lan or Olivia
- Friday afternoon: Nessa

If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Kevin and Rebecca must lead an afternoon session on Wednesday or Friday. Lan and Olivia cannot lead their session on Friday. There are two possible cases:

Case 1: Kevin and Rebecca lead their session on Wednesday afternoon.
- Wednesday morning: (empty slot)
- Wednesday afternoon: Kevin or Rebecca
- Thursday morning: (empty slot)
- Thursday afternoon: Julio
- Friday morning: Olivia
- Friday afternoon: Nessa

In this case, we know which sessions are led by Kevin, Rebecca, Julio, Olivia, and Nessa, so the answer is 5.

Case 2: Kevin and Rebecca lead their session on Friday afternoon.
- Wednesday morning: (empty slot)
- Wednesday afternoon: Kevin or Rebecca
- Thursday morning: (empty slot)
- Thursday afternoon: Julio
- Friday morning: Lan
- Friday afternoon: Nessa

In this case, we know which sessions are led by Kevin, Rebecca, Julio, Lan, and Nessa, so the answer is 5.

Therefore, the answer is not one, but five. Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days.
  - One session is held each morning and one each afternoon.
  - Each session is led by a different lab assistant.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Rebecca must lead the Thursday morning session, since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session, since Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan must lead one of the two remaining morning sessions and Olivia must lead the other. Therefore, for two of the other lab assistants, one can determine which sessions they lead. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days.
  - Each session will be led by a different lab assistant.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, we can determine which sessions four other lab assistants lead.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. The chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session being held each morning and one each afternoon.
  2. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Solution:
  1. If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then the sessions that remain on Thursday are the Thursday morning session and the Friday morning session.
  2. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, we can determine that Kevin and Rebecca will lead the Wednesday or Friday afternoon session.
  3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Since Olivia's session is on Friday morning, Lan cannot lead the Thursday morning session. Therefore, Lan must lead the Wednesday morning session.
  4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Therefore, Nessa will lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  5. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Since Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon, Olivia's session must be either on Friday morning or Friday afternoon.
  6. All sessions have been assigned to different lab assistants except for the Friday morning session, which can only be led by either Kevin or Rebecca. Therefore, two of the other lab assistants can be determined to lead specific sessions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions.
  3. Each lab session will be led by a different lab assistant.
  4. There are three lab sessions per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  6. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  7. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  8. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Reasoning:
  1. If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  2. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, but it cannot be on Friday, which means she will lead the Wednesday afternoon session.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, which can be either Wednesday or Thursday. Without loss of generality, let's assume they lead sessions on Wednesday.
  4. By elimination, Lan will lead a session on Thursday morning, and Nessa, Kevin, and Rebecca will lead sessions on Thursday afternoon.
  5. Therefore, the only remaining lab assistant is Lan, and we know that he will lead a session on Friday morning, completing the schedule.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon.
  - Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. 
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia’s session cannot be on Thursday, because Julio’s session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Olivia's session must be on Friday. This also means that both Lan and Nessa cannot lead the Friday session because Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day and Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Therefore, Lan’s session must be on Friday, and Nessa’s session must be on Wednesday. 
Now, we know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Kevin's session must be on Wednesday and Rebecca's session must be on Thursday. 

So, we have the following assignments:
- Wednesday morning: Kevin
- Wednesday afternoon: Nessa
- Thursday morning: 1) Julio or 2) Rebecca
- Thursday afternoon: Julio or Rebecca
- Friday morning: Lan
- Friday afternoon: Olivia

We can determine which sessions are led by Lan and Olivia, so the answer is:
Action: Answer("2") - (B)
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days.
  Each session will be led by a different lab assistant: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  We know that Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  We can use the constraints to determine which sessions the other lab assistants lead.
  We can go through each lab assistant and determine which sessions they are eligible to lead based on the constraints.
  If an assistant can only lead one session based on the constraints, we can determine which session they lead.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. The chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days.
  2. One session is held each morning and one each afternoon.
  3. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  6. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  7. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Reasoning:
  1. If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Nessa cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  2. Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and Nessa must lead an afternoon session, then Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on either Wednesday or Thursday afternoon. Therefore, Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on Wednesday or Thursday afternoon since they cannot lead sessions on the same day. This means that Lan and Olivia must lead sessions that meet on Friday (one in the morning and one in the afternoon).
  3. Since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, and Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Julio must lead the Wednesday morning session and Olivia must lead the Friday morning session.
  4. Therefore, the only lab assistant for which we cannot determine the session they lead is the lab assistant that is left, which is Lan.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days.
- Each session will be led by a different lab assistant: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca.
- There are two sessions each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session:
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Wednesday or Friday, since Thursday afternoon is taken.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on Thursday, since Julio has the Thursday afternoon session.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session, which means she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning.

With this information, we can determine the lab session assignments for four of the lab assistants: 
- Julio: Wednesday morning
- Olivia: Thursday morning
- Nessa: Friday afternoon 
- Rebecca: Wednesday or Friday (with Kevin)

The lab session assignments for Lan and Kevin could be either of the remaining two sessions. 

Therefore, the answer is D: four.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. The lab sessions are scheduled over three days, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  2. Each day has one morning and one afternoon session.
  3. Each session is led by one lab assistant, and there are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  6. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  7. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session:
  - Neither Lan nor Olivia can lead the Thursday morning session because they cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday morning session.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, and it cannot be Thursday because Julio is leading the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday or Friday sessions.
  - Julio's session must be earlier than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's must be on Friday afternoon.
  
  Therefore, the only assistant whose session cannot be determined is Lan because she could lead either the Wednesday afternoon or Friday morning session.

Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. There are four walls and each wall has an upper and a lower position for paintings.
  2. Each of the four students displays exactly one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then that wall must also contain Franz's oil, which would violate rule 5. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall cannot contain any of Hidalgo's paintings and it would violate rule 4. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: This is possible, according to rule 6. Therefore, C can be true.
D: This is possible, as long as Hidalgo's oil is displayed in the upper position on a different wall. Therefore, D can be true.
E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall must also contain Isaacs's oil, which would violate rule 5. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Four art students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will display exactly two paintings each, one oil and one watercolor.
  Two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution: 
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be in an upper position, because each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position and no wall has only watercolors displayed on it (eliminating option D).
  If Isaacs's oil is in a lower position, then Isaacs's watercolor must be in an upper position on one of the walls 1, 2, or 3, because no wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it (eliminating option E).
  Now we can try to place the remaining paintings accordingly:
  - If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil (option A), then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 4, but then there would be only watercolors on wall 3, which contradicts the given condition (eliminating option A).
  - If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil (option B), then Greene's oil must be on wall 4, which means that wall 4 would have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Greene displayed on it, which contradicts the given condition (eliminating option B).
  - If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position (option C), then we can place Greene's watercolor in the lower position of wall 1, Franz's oil and watercolor in the upper and lower positions of wall 2 (in some order), Hidalgo's oil in the upper position of wall 4, and Isaacs's watercolor in the upper position of wall 3. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions and does not contradict any of the options. Therefore, the answer is not C.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each of the four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  2. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Logic: 
  From condition 6, we know that Franz's oil painting and Greene's watercolor painting are displayed on the same wall. Therefore, if Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil (option A), or Hidalgo's oil (option B), then that wall would only have paintings from two students, which would violate condition 4. If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position (option C), then this would imply that Franz's oil painting would have to be in the lower position on the same wall, which would violate condition 6. If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position (option D), then this would imply that Hidalgo's oil painting is in the upper position on the same wall, which would violate condition 3. Therefore, the only option that cannot be true is E, where Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. According to condition 5, no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - 4 art students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, Isaacs.
  - Each student displays 2 paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly 2 paintings will be displayed on each of the 4 walls.
  - No wall has only watercolors.
  - No wall has only work of one student.
  - No wall has both paintings by Franz and Isaacs.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed with Franz's oil on a wall.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed on the lower position of wall 4.
Action: 
  - If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil (upper position), then Hidalgo's oil must be on the same wall in the lower position. This does not violate any of the given conditions.
  - If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Greene's oil must be on the same wall in the lower position. This does not violate any of the given conditions.
  - If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall in the lower position. Therefore, no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, which violates one of the given conditions. Hence, this option cannot be true.
  - If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall in the upper position. This does not violate any of the given conditions.
  - If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed on the same wall in the lower position. This does not violate any of the given conditions.
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then if Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil or Hidalgo's oil, then Franz's oil would be on that same wall, violating a condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - If Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, then his watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil because that would violate the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - Therefore, the only statement that CANNOT be true is (D) Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position since that would mean that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, which violates the condition that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has two positions; upper and lower.
  - Four art students- Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs- will each display exactly two paintings- an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls- walls 1, 2, 3, and 4- with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed on some other wall. This is possible according to the given conditions. Therefore A can be true.
B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then neither Hidalgo's watercolor nor oil can be displayed on that wall. This means either Hidalgo will have only one painting on display, or both of Hidalgo's paintings will be displayed on one of the remaining two walls, along with the paintings of two other artists. Both scenarios violate one of the given conditions. Thus, B cannot be true.
C: This is possible. According to the given conditions, Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position, and it is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil, which means Franz's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the upper position of some other wall. Therefore, C can be true.
D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in the lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of the same wall. This means the wall will have only Hidalgo's paintings, which violates one of the given conditions. Thus, D cannot be true.
E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on that wall. Therefore, Isaacs's oil must be displayed on one of the remaining two walls, along with the paintings of two other artists. This means either one of the walls will have only Isaacs's paintings or one of the walls will have the paintings of three different artists. Both scenarios violate one of the given conditions. Hence, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.

  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  - Choice A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed in the upper position of the same wall, which means that both of Franz's paintings are on the same wall. This is a violation of the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, A is not possible.
  - Choice B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the same wall, which means that both of Franz's paintings are on the same wall. This is a violation of the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, B is not possible.
  - Choice C: According to the condition, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. This means that Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position. Therefore, C is possible.
  - Choice D: This is possible because there is no restriction on the positions that Hidalgo's paintings can be displayed in.
  - Choice E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed in the upper position of the same wall, which means that both of Isaacs's paintings are on the same wall. This is a violation of the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, E is not possible.

  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Analysis: 
  Option A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then it means Franz's oil and watercolor have to be displayed on different walls. This is possible, so this cannot be the answer.
  Option B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then it means Franz's oil and watercolor have to be displayed on different walls. This is also possible, so this cannot be the answer.
  Option C: If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then it means his watercolor has to be on a wall different from Franz's oil. This is possible, so this cannot be the answer.
  Option D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then it means Hidalgo's oil has to be on a different wall from Hidalgo's watercolor. This is possible, so this cannot be the answer.
  Option E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Isaacs's oil has to be on a different wall from Isaacs's watercolor. This is possible, so this cannot be the answer.

  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  - Choice A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then that wall must contain the paintings of both Franz and Greene. However, no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this cannot be true. 
  - Choice B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall must contain the paintings of both Franz and Hidalgo, which is possible since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this can be true.
  - Choice C: We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  - Choice D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then that wall must contain Hidalgo's watercolor and another student's oil. This is possible since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this can be true.
  - Choice E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall must contain the paintings of both Isaacs and Hidalgo, which is possible since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. However, Isaacs's oil is already displayed in the lower position of wall 4, which means that Isaacs cannot have a painting in the upper position of any wall. Therefore, this cannot be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert
  D: Kyle and Nina
  E: Olivia and Kyle
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The seminar consists of eight students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Only six of the students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
  Two students will give reports each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  - If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, but they cannot both give their reports with Nina. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, Helen and Irving will both give their reports on Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then there is no requirement for Helen and Irving to give reports on any particular day.
  - If George gives his report on Tuesday, then one of the remaining students (not Olivia or Robert) will give their report with George in the morning, and another one of the remaining students (not Olivia or Robert) will give their report with George in the afternoon.
  - Therefore, the only possibility for a pair of students who *must* give reports on Wednesday is if Nina gives her report on Tuesday and Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Six students will give reports during three consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  4. Olivia and Robert can not give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Process:
  From condition (3) George will give a report on Tuesday.
  From condition (4) Olivia and Robert won't give an afternoon report. So, they will give reports in the morning.
  From condition (5), If Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must give reports. But that's not possible as only George can give a report on Tuesday. So, Nina's report will be on Wednesday.
  From condition (5), if Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving will not give reports together. So, Nina's partner will be either on Monday or Tuesday.
  Thus, the possible pairs of students that will give reports on Wednesday are:
  - George and Helen
  - George and Irving
  - George and Lenore
  - Helen and Nina
  - Irving and Nina
  - Lenore and Nina
  
Action: Answer("B") 
So, the pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday is Helen and Nina.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. George must give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina’s report is given on Wednesday.

Analysis:
  We do not have any information about Kyle giving a report. So, Kyle and Nina cannot give reports on the same day.
  George cannot give reports on Monday or Wednesday. So, George and Lenore cannot give reports on the same day.
  Irving needs to give a report on Tuesday, Wednesday, or both, to comply with the third condition. If Irving gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen also needs to give a report on Tuesday, which is not possible. Hence, Irving cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Irving needs to give reports on Wednesday. Then, Nina cannot give a report on Monday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen must give a report on Wednesday, which means that Lenore cannot give a report on Wednesday. So, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. Thus, Helen must give a report on Tuesday. This means that Lenore and Robert must give reports on Monday and Kyle must give a report on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- There are three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- Only six students will give oral reports.
Action: 
- If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving both need to give reports on the next day, except if Nina's report is on Wednesday. That means that if Helen or Irving give a report on Wednesday, then Nina cannot give a report. 
- George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Wednesday. 
- Olivia and Robert cannot give reports on the afternoon, so they can only give reports on Monday or Tuesday. 
- This means that if Nina gives a report, then the students who must give reports on Wednesday are Kyle, George, and Lenore. Therefore, Nina cannot be part of that pair, as she cannot give a report on Wednesday if Helen and Irving gave reports on the next day after her. 
- The only pair that includes one of these students is (B) Helen and Nina. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly 6 students will give reports over three consecutive days.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day that George can give his report.
  4. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means that George cannot give his report on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, but George cannot give his report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give her report on Monday or Tuesday. This means that Kyle must give his report on Monday or Tuesday.
  Therefore, George can only give his report on Tuesday morning, and Kyle must give his report on Monday or Tuesday.
  
Analysis:
  If Kyle gives his report on Monday, then Olivia and Robert must give their reports on Monday, and Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. This would mean that Lenore and Nina would give their reports on Wednesday. In this scenario, there is no pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  
  If Kyle gives his report on Tuesday, then Olivia and Robert must give their reports on Wednesday, and Helen and Irving must give their reports on Monday. This would mean that Lenore and Nina would give their reports on Tuesday. In this scenario, the only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other is Olivia and Robert.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Six students will give oral reports.
  2. Two students will give oral reports each day.
  3. Reports will be given for three consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  4. One morning and one afternoon report will be given each day.
  5. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  6. Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  7. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Using the given conditions, we can create a table to help us determine which pairs of students must give reports on Wednesday:

| Day       | Morning              | Afternoon            |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Monday    |                      |                        |
| Tuesday   | George               |                        |
| Wednesday | Helen, Irving, Nina* | Olivia, Kyle, Lenore* |

*If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports.
*If Nina's report is on Wednesday, then Lenore must give a report.

We want to find a pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday. In the table above, we see that if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is B: Helen and Nina. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The seminar has 8 students, and exactly 6 will give reports over three days.
  Exactly 2 reports will be given each day.
  Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report:
    - The next day (after Nina's report) Helen and Irving must both give reports.
    - Unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  We know George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot be part of the pair.
  Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give afternoon reports, they cannot be part of the pair.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and the pair would have to be on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give a report on Wednesday, and the pair would have to be on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then there is no requirement for Helen and Irving to give a report on the following day, and the pair could be on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
  Therefore, the only possible pair that must give reports on Wednesday is Kyle and Nina if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Six reports will be given by eight students in three consecutive days.
  2. Two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  4. Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

We need to determine which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other. 
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (which is Wednesday) Helen and Irving must both give reports. Thus, either Nina should NOT give a report OR Helen and Irving will both give reports on Wednesday. 
So, we need to find a pair of students other than Helen and Irving who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
George can only give a report on Tuesday and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, they cannot be part of the pair that must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.

Analysis:
  A: George and Lenore can't be the answer because George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  B: Helen and Nina can't be the answer because they can't give reports on the same day due to the condition that Helen and Irving both must give reports on the day after Nina gives a report, if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  C: Irving and Robert can't be the answer because Robert can't give an afternoon report.
  D: Kyle and Nina can't be the answer because we already eliminated Nina.
  E: Olivia and Kyle can't be the answer because Olivia can't give an afternoon report. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  * There are eight students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  * There are three consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
  * Exactly two reports are given each day.
  * Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  * Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  * If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

To answer the question, we need to determine which pairs of students must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.

Analysis:
  * If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he must be paired with one of the students who can give an afternoon report: Helen, Irving, Kyle, or Lenore. However, we don't know which day George will be paired with any of these students.
  * If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina cannot be paired with Helen or Irving on any day other than Wednesday.
  * Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they cannot be paired with each other or with George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, or Lenore on Wednesday.

Possible pairs for each student:
  * George: Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore
  * Helen: George, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina
  * Irving: George, Helen, Kyle, Lenore, Nina
  * Kyle: George, Helen, Irving, Lenore, Nina
  * Lenore: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Nina
  * Nina: Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore
  * Olivia: George, Irving, Kyle, Lenore
  * Robert: George, Helen, Kyle, Lenore

We need to identify which student pairs only appear on the same day on Wednesday:
  * George and Lenore can appear on Monday or Wednesday.
  * Helen and Nina can appear on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  * Irving and Robert can appear on Monday or Wednesday.
  * Kyle and Nina can appear on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  * Olivia and Kyle cannot appear on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Based on the conditions of the question, George can only give a report on Tuesday. 
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must both give morning reports if they are giving reports on the same day.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  
Analysis:
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday. If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving will not give reports on the same day, unless it is Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. If Helen and Irving are giving reports on Wednesday, then the other pair of reports must be given on Monday or Tuesday. We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so the pair of reports given on Wednesday must be given by Kyle and Lenore because Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  2. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  3. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  5. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  6. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  7. The shoe store is in space 2.

Analysis:
  From constraint 3 we know that the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7 and must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6, which cannot be true because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian (constraint 6). So, the pharmacy must be in space 1. 
  
  From constraint 1, we know that the restaurant must be in space 7. Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 3 and 7. Additionally, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian (constraint 5). Since the pharmacy is in space 1, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2. Therefore, the toy store cannot be in space 3, so it must be in space 4. The veterinarian cannot be in space 3, so it must be in space 6. The optometrist must be in space 5 and a restaurant must be in space 7. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be located in space 1 or space 7. Also, one of the restaurants must be located in space 1 or space 7. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and E as the optometrist is not next to the pharmacy in either case and a restaurant is not at the other end of the row in either case. 

Choice B is compatible with the constraints because the pharmacy can be in space 1 and one of the restaurants can be in space 7. 

Choice C is not compatible with the constraints because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. 

Choice D is not compatible with the constraints because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The shopping center has exactly seven spaces.
  Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy cannot be in space 2.
  
Analysis:
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be at the other end of the row, in space 1 or space 7.
  Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, we can deduce that the optometrist or the veterinarian must be located adjacent to the pharmacy.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, meaning there must be at least one business between the two restaurants.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, but it can be in any other location. Therefore, if the shoe store is in space 2, the toy store could be located in space 6.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy and one restaurant must be in spaces 1 and 7, respectively. 
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the only possible arrangement for the restaurants is R _ _ T _ _ R.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. So, the only possible arrangement is V-P or P-V, where V is veterinarian and P is pharmacy.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the toy store cannot be at space 3 or 4.
  
  A: The optometrist cannot be in space 5 because it is not adjacent to either pharmacy or veterinarian. So this option is not true.
  B: The pharmacy can be in space 1 as V-P arrangement is possible. So this option could be true.
  C: A restaurant cannot be in space 3 because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. So this option is not true.
  D: The toy store cannot be in space 6 because it cannot be next to the veterinarian. So this option is not true.
  E: The veterinarian can be in space 4 as V-P arrangement is possible. So this option could be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then space 1 and space 3 cannot be occupied by the pharmacy or a restaurant.
  
Analysis:
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the only businesses that could be in the two adjacent spaces (spaces 1 and 3) are the optometrist, veterinarian, and toy store. 
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then a restaurant must be in space 7. However, the other restaurant must be separated from the first restaurant by at least two other businesses, which is not possible since there are only two businesses left. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1.
  If a restaurant is in space 3, then the other restaurant must be in either space 5 or space 7. If the other restaurant is in space 7, then the optometrist and veterinarian must be in spaces 1 and 4 (in some order), which means that the toy store would have to be in space 6, violating the constraint that it cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, a restaurant cannot be in space 3.
  This leaves us with three possible options: 
  - The optometrist is in space 5 and the veterinarian is in space 4, which satisfies all of the constraints. 
  - The veterinarian is in space 5 and the optometrist is in space 4, which also satisfies all of the constraints. 
  - The toy store is in space 4 and the optometrist and veterinarian are in spaces 1 and 5 (in some order), which satisfies all of the constraints.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The shopping center has seven spaces, arranged in a straight row.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the optometrist cannot be in space 3 or space 1, as the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the pharmacy cannot be in space 2. 

Analysis:
  A: If the optometrist is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in space 7 and a restaurant in space 1, which means the shoe store cannot be in space 2. Thus, option A is not possible.
  B: If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist must be in space 2 and a restaurant in space 7, which means the toy store cannot be in space 6. Thus, option B is not possible.
  C: If a restaurant is in space 3, then the other restaurant must be in space 7, the pharmacy must be in space 1, and the optometrist and veterinarian must be in space 2 and space 4 in some order. This arrangement is possible, so option C could be true.
  D: If the toy store is in space 6, then the veterinarian must be in space 5, the optometrist or pharmacy must be in space 4, and the other restaurant must be in space 1. This arrangement is not possible, so option D is not possible.
  E: If the veterinarian is in space 4, then the optometrist or pharmacy must be in space 3, the other restaurant must be in space 7, and the toy store must be in space 6. This arrangement is not possible, as the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so option E is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Seven businesses will occupy seven spaces arranged in a straight row in a shopping center.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy cannot be in space 2, nor can it be in space 7. Therefore, the pharmacy can only be in space 1 or space 6.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 to satisfy the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. This would leave spaces 3 to 7 for the remaining businesses, which means that only one of the two restaurants would be able to fit in the remaining spaces between the two restaurants.
  - Therefore, if the pharmacy is in space 1, a restaurant cannot be in space 3, and, in turn, cannot be at the end of the row. This contradicts the constraint that one of the restaurants must be at the end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1, and it must be in space 6.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 6, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 7 to satisfy the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The remaining businesses can be arranged in spaces 3 to 5, which means that the two restaurants can be separated by at least two other businesses, and a restaurant can be in space 3.
  - Therefore, if the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy must be in space 6, a restaurant can be in space 3, and the optometrist can be in space 5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  If the shoe store is in space 2, the businesses in spaces 1 and 3 are determined, and the businesses in spaces 4, 5, 6, and 7 can be any of the remaining businesses.
  A: If the shoe store is in space 2, the optometrist must be in space 3, so the optometrist cannot be in space 5. Incorrect.
  B: If the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy can only be in space 1. Correct.
  C: The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so no restaurant can be in space 3. Incorrect.
  D: If the shoe store is in space 2, the toy store cannot be in space 6 because the veterinarian cannot be in space 5. Incorrect.
  E: If the shoe store is in space 2, the veterinarian must be in space 4. Correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants at the other. 
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. 
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. 
  If the pharmacy is next to the shoe store, then there are only two possible spaces for the pharmacy, space 1 or space 3.
  If the pharmacy is in space 3, then spaces 4 and 5 must be the two restaurants, and the optometrist, toy store, and veterinarian must be in spaces 4, 5, and 6, in some order. 
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then spaces 2 and 3 must be the two restaurants. Then, optometrist, toy store, and veterinarian must be in spaces 4, 5, and 6, in some order. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store cannot be in space 5.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a straight line from space 1 to space 7.
  - There are seven businesses, each one will occupy one space: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.
Action: 
Based on the constraints, we know that the pharmacy must be at either end of the row, and the restaurants must be at the opposite end. We also know that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since there are seven spaces, there are only two possible configurations for the businesses:
Pharmacy - (1 or 6) - Business - Business - Restaurant - Business - Restaurant
Restaurant - Business - Business - Restaurant - (2 or 7) - Business - Pharmacy
If the shoe store is in space 2, then it cannot be next to the pharmacy, which must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the only possible configuration is:
Restaurant - Business - Business - Restaurant - 2 - Business - Pharmacy
This means that the optometrist cannot be in space 5 (A) and the toy store cannot be in space 6 (D), but it is possible for the pharmacy to be in space 1 (B), for a restaurant to be in space 3 (C), and for the veterinarian to be in space 4 (E).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians (Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang) will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, then either the oil paintings lecture or the watercolors lecture is the second one.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
Based on the given constraints, if watercolors is third, then oil paintings must be second. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture must be first. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden's lecture must be either the second or the first lecture. However, since we know Farley's lecture is the first one, Holden's lecture must be the second lecture. Hence, Garcia's lecture must be the fourth, and Jiang's lecture must be the third. Therefore, the option B (Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture) could be true.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The lectures are on 4 topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
- Each art historian gives a lecture on a different topic.
- The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints:
  - Oil paintings and watercolors must both be earlier than lithographs.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.

If watercolors is third, then the schedule must look like this:
1. Either Farley or Holden gives a lecture.
2. The other of Farley and Holden gives a lecture.
3. A lecture on watercolors.
4. Either Garcia or Jiang gives a lecture.

A: Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture because Farley must give a lecture before oil paintings.
B: Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture because oil paintings must be earlier than lithographs, and Garcia is last to give a lecture.
C: Garcia could give the sculptures lecture. This does not contravene any of the constraints.
D: Holden cannot give the sculptures lecture because Holden must give a lecture before Garcia and Jiang.
E: Jiang cannot give the lithographs lecture because Jiang must give a lecture last.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1) There are four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  2) Each of the four historians will give one lecture.
  3) The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  4) Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  5) Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
  If the watercolors lecture is third, it means that the order of the lectures must be one of the following:
  - (1) lithographs, (2) sculptures, (3) watercolors, (4) oil paintings.
  - (1) sculptures, (2) lithographs, (3) watercolors, (4) oil paintings.
  - (1) sculptures, (2) watercolors, (3) lithographs, (4) oil paintings.

A: Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture since it is already determined that the watercolors lecture is third. Therefore, A is false.
B: If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of lectures must be as follows: (1) lithographs, (2) sculptures, (3) watercolors, (4) oil paintings. Therefore, B is false.
C: If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of lectures must be as follows: (1) sculptures, (2) lithographs, (3) watercolors, (4) oil paintings. Therefore, C could be true.
D: If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of lectures must be as follows: (1) sculptures, (2) lithographs, (3) watercolors, (4) oil paintings. Holden cannot give the sculptures lecture since it is already determined that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lectures. Therefore, D is false.
E: If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of lectures must be as follows: (1) sculptures, (2) lithographs, (3) watercolors, (4) oil paintings. Therefore, E could be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians (Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang) will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic
  - The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture
  - If the watercolors lecture is third, this means that it is not the first or the second lecture

A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, this means that Farley's lecture is either the first or the second lecture. This would mean that the oil paintings lecture would have to be later than the watercolors lecture, which violates the constraint that oil paintings must be earlier than lithographs. Therefore, A is false.
B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, this means that either Farley or Holden will give the watercolors lecture. Based on the constraints, Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Holden will give the watercolors lecture. This satisfies the constraint of watercolors and oil paintings being earlier than lithographs, so B is true.
C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden and Jiang must give the watercolors and oil paintings lectures. However, Farley must give his lecture earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so this would be a contradiction. Therefore, C is false.
D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia and Jiang must give the watercolors and oil paintings lectures. However, this would be a contradiction because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, D is false.
E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then Farley and Holden must give the watercolors and oil paintings lectures. However, this would violate the constraint that watercolors and oil paintings must be earlier than lithographs. Therefore, E is false.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are four public lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives one lecture on one topic.
  - Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang are four art historians.
  - There are constraints governing the order of the lectures:
    1. The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    2. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    3. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - The watercolors lecture is third.
  
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture, which can't be true because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture is already the third lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, which can be true because oil paintings must be after watercolors, and Garcia's lecture can be either sculptures or oil paintings.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, which can't be true because the watercolors lecture is already the third lecture and there can't be any lecture after the watercolor lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture, which can't be true because Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. If Holden gives the sculpture lecture, then Garcia or Jiang must give the watercolor lecture which is already the third lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, which can be true because Jiang's lecture can be either lithographs or sculptures, and Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures on lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
- Each historian will give a lecture on a different topic, one at a time.
- The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints:
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
- If the watercolors lecture is third, that means the lithographs lecture is last.
- Farley must go before the oil paintings lecture, so that means Farley will give the watercolors or the sculptures lecture.
- Holden's lecture goes before Garcia's and Jiang's lectures, so that means Holden will give the sculptures lecture.
- Garcia can't give the sculptures lecture because Holden already is, so that means Garcia will give the oil paintings lecture.
- That leaves Jiang to give the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("B") - Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. 
- The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
- The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
- If the watercolors lecture is third, one can infer that the lectures on oil paintings and sculptures must be the first two, but it is not clear which one goes first.
  
Analysis:
If the watercolors lecture is third, then the lectures on oil paintings and sculptures must be the first and second lectures, but the order is not specified. 
A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden must give the first lecture and Garcia the second lecture. This means that Jiang must give the last lecture on lithographs, but this contradicts the given constraint that the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must precede the lithographs lecture. So, this option is not possible.
B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Holden must give the first lecture and Farley the second lecture. Jiang would then give the last lecture on lithographs, which satisfies the given constraint that the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must precede the lithographs lecture. This option is possible.
C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden must give the first lecture and Farley the second lecture. Jiang would give the last lecture on lithographs, but this violates the constraint that the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must precede the lithographs lecture. So, this option is not possible.
D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia must give the first lecture and Farley the second lecture. Jiang would then give the last lecture on lithographs, which satisfies the given constraint that the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must precede the lithographs lecture. This option is possible.
E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then Holden must give the first lecture and Farley the second lecture. This means that Garcia must give the third lecture, which contradicts the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. So, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- We know that there are four lectures, each on one of the following topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
- We know that the lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different topic.
- We know that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
- We know that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
- We know that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

Analysis:
If the watercolors lecture is third, then:
- The lectures that must come before it are oil paintings (because it and watercolors must both be earlier than lithographs) and Farley's lecture (because that must come before the oil paintings lecture).
- That means that the order of the first three lectures is: Farley, oil paintings, watercolors.
- Holden's lecture must come before Garcia's and Jiang's lectures, so it must be the first one.
- That leaves Garcia to give the sculptures lecture, and Jiang to give the lithographs lecture.

Action: Answer("D") - Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures on different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
- Each historian will give a lecture on a different topic, and one lecture at a time.
- Schedule constraints:
  - Oil paintings lecture and watercolors lecture before the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lecture.

If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures must be one of the following:
1. Oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs
2. Sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs
3. Oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures, lithographs

A. If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then they must be first, which contradicts the given information that watercolors lecture is third.
B. If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then oil paintings lecture must be first or second, which contradicts the given information that watercolors lecture is third.
C. If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the order must be: Oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures, lithographs. This is a valid schedule that satisfies all constraints.
D. If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then the order must be: Oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures, lithographs. This is a valid schedule that satisfies all constraints.
E. If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the order must be: Oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures, lithographs. This is a valid schedule that satisfies all constraints.

Action: Answer("C") - Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  If the watercolors lecture is third, it means that either the oil paintings lecture or the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture are before the watercolors lecture.
  
Analysis: 
  Since the watercolors lecture is third, either the oil paintings lecture or the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture are before the watercolors lecture. Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the watercolors lecture because Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's and Jiang's lecture. The only option that works is if Holden gives the sculptures lecture. Then Garcia and Jiang must give the oil paintings lecture and the lithographs lecture, but it is not known in which order.

  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. 
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. 
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. 
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. 
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. 
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Solution:
  From the constraints, we know that Frost and Heideck must work together. So, Frost, Heideck, and 4 other photographers will be assigned to the two ceremonies. 
  If Gonzalez assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. 
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. Therefore, either Lai or Mays can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  A: Frost and Heideck cannot be separated. This option is not valid.
  B: Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, but he is not assigned in this option. This option is not valid.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The panel must include at least one botanist, at least one chemist, and at least one zoologist.
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("E")

If exactly two chemists are selected, and P is the only zoologist selected, there must be one botanist on the panel. From the given options, the only one that satisfies this condition is E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. If G is selected as one of the two chemists, then the other scientist must be a botanist (either F or H). However, if F is selected, then at least two zoologists (P and either Q or R) would have to be selected to satisfy the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. This contradicts the given information that only P is selected as the zoologist. Therefore, if two chemists are selected, G cannot be one of them.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("B")

If L is selected, F cannot be selected. 
This is because if L is selected, the other two chemists must be K and M. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. This leaves only one spot left for a botanist, and since G and H cannot be with each other, if L is selected, the only botanist that can be selected is F. Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G and either K or L or M must be selected.

Analysis:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then exactly two botanists and exactly two chemists must be selected.
  If K is selected, then F and either L or M must be selected.
  If L is selected instead of K, then G and M must be selected.
  If M is selected, then F, P and R must be selected.
  
A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - Not necessarily true. G can be selected if L is selected instead of K.
B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - Not necessarily true. F can be selected if K is selected instead of L.
C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - Not necessarily true. L can be selected instead of K.
D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. - Not necessarily true. F can be selected if K and L are selected.
E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. - Not necessarily true. G can be selected if L and M are selected.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
To be true:
- If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two types of scientists selected must be one botanist and one chemist.
- If K is selected, then F cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected. Hence, A is not true.
- If L is selected, then F can still be selected because there is no restriction on selecting L and F. Hence, B is not true.
- If exactly one chemist is selected, then K cannot be the only chemist selected because there must be at least one botanist and one zoologist selected. Hence, C is not true.
- If exactly two chemists are selected, then F can still be selected because there is no restriction on selecting F with two chemists. Hence, D is not true.
- If exactly two chemists are selected, then G cannot be selected because if K is selected, then G cannot be selected (as shown in option A), and if L and M are selected, then at most one botanist can be selected. Hence, E is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must have at least one scientist from each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  - If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected. 
  - We know that only one zoologist, P, is selected. 

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
  - Since only one zoologist is selected, there must be two botanists and two chemists on the panel.
  - If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K, because L and M cannot be selected together. 
  - Therefore, (C) If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K, must be true.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, F could be selected along with either G or H, so this statement is not necessarily true. 
  B: If L is selected, then K and M must not be selected because both of them can't be together. This means that we would have to select at least two botanists. But if we select two botanists then we can select at most one zoologist and one chemist, which means that we cannot select L. Therefore this statement must be true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, then it can be any of the three chemists. There is no specific requirement for this selection, so this statement is not necessarily true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then the panel must include exactly one botanist and one zoologist. Since P is the only zoologist selected, we must select one botanist and one chemist from either F, G, H and L, M. So, this statement is not necessarily true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, the panel must include exactly one botanist and one zoologist. Since P is the only zoologist selected, we must select one botanist and one chemist from either F, G, H and L, M. So, this statement is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then no more than one botanist can be selected.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If P is the only zoologist selected, then no more than one botanist can be selected. This means that either F, G, or H is selected. Also, since we need at least one scientist from each type, we must select at least one chemist. Let's consider the options:

A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  - This is not necessarily true. We could select K, L, and P, which satisfies all the conditions.

B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  - This is not necessarily true. We could select L, G, and P, which satisfies all the conditions.

C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  - This is true. We must select at least one chemist, and if we select exactly one, it cannot be L or M (because of the other conditions). Therefore, the only option is K.

D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  - This is not necessarily true. We could select K, L, and P, which satisfies all the conditions.

E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
  - This is not necessarily true. We could select K, L, and P, which satisfies all the conditions.

Therefore, the answer is (C) If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. The panel must have at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  2. If more than one botanist is selected, at most one zoologist is selected.
  3. F and K cannot both be selected.
  4. K and M cannot both be selected.
  5. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

If P is the only zoologist selected, then at least one botanist and at least one chemist must be selected. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. So, either one botanist and one chemist are selected along with P, or two botanists and one chemist are selected along with P.

Scenario 1: One botanist and one chemist are selected along with P.
In this scenario, there are two possible combinations of scientists, depending on whether F, G, or H is selected as the botanist, and whether K, L, or M is selected as the chemist:

  FKP or GKP or HKP or FLQ or FML or GLM

Of these six possibilities, only the first one violates the condition that F and K cannot both be selected. So, if K is selected, G cannot be selected. This leads to:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected, but not both.
  
  Analysis of options:
  A: If K is selected, and G is selected, then F cannot be selected because only one botanist can be selected, but F and G are both botanists. This statement is true. 
  B: If L is selected, then there are no restrictions on which botanist can be selected. This statement is not true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be any one of the three chemists - K, L or M. This statement is not true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then botanist G must be selected because F cannot be selected if two chemists are already selected. This statement is true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, and K is one of the selected chemists, then F cannot be selected because F and K cannot be selected together. This statement is true.
Action: Answer("AE")  
The correct options are A and E.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("D")

If P is the only zoologist selected, then F and G must be the two botanists selected, as there can't be more than one zoologist selected. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. But since only P is selected, we can conclude that M is not selected. Therefore, we can't have both K and L selected, as that would leave only M as an available chemist. This means that if exactly two chemists are selected, neither F nor L can be selected. So, if exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find the person that Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  Also, we know that there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, at least three of them should work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 2, and Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  Now, we have two remaining sales representatives that can work in any of the three sales zones: Parra and Quinn.
  We are asked to find the person that Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone. 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so the only person left is Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, then if we find where Parra is located then we will also find Quinn. 
  There are two possibilities for Parra: Zone 1 or a zone other than Zone 1.
  * If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot be in that zone due to the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must be in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. However, Udall cannot be in the same zone as Tiao. Therefore, Udall must be in the other zone (either Zone 2 or Zone 3). Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, then Stuckey must be in the same zone as Udall, which means that they are both in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then we conclude that Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3, and there are three sales representatives in Zone 3.
  * If Parra is not in Zone 1, then Tiao must be in Zone 1, and Udall must be in Zone 3. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, then Stuckey must be in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then we conclude that there are four sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  In both cases, we conclude that Quinn can be in the same sales zone as A, B, or C. The only two remaining sales representatives are Kim and Mahr, which means that Quinn cannot be in the same sales zone as Tiao or Udall.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so if Quinn works in Zone 1 or Zone 2, then Parra must work in the same sales zone as well, violating the condition that only one of them can work in Zone 1 and only one of them can work in Zone 2. 
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao or Udall, who are the only two sales representatives that can work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  2. Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  5. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Process of elimination:
  - From condition 3, Parra and Quinn work in the same zone. If Quinn cannot work in the same zone as Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao, or Udall, then Parra must work with one of those four. 
  - From condition 1, either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Since Parra works with either Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao or Udall, then Tiao must work with the four that Parra doesn't work with. This means Tiao works in Zone 3, with one of Kim, Mahr, Stuckey or Udall.
  - From condition 2, either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Since Tiao already works in Zone 3, that means Udall works in Zone 2.
  - From condition 4, Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. Since Udall works in Zone 2, that means Stuckey also works in Zone 2 with Udall.
  - From condition 5, there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. We already have 3 representatives in Zone 2 (Parra, Quinn, and Stuckey), so the remaining 4 representatives must be in Zone 3.
  
Answer: Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as D: Tiao.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  We need to find which sales representative cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn based on the given conditions.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, they must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 3. 
  If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao must be in Zone 2 and Udall must be in Zone 3.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall must be in Zone 3 and Parra must be in Zone 1.
  Either way, Quinn is in the same sales zone as Parra and Udall, which means Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("C")  

Explanation: 
  Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey because it is stated that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and we know that Quinn is already working in the same sales zone as Parra. Therefore, Quinn can only work in Zone 2 or Zone 3, and since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it is more likely that Quinn works in Zone 3, which means Stuckey and Udall must also work in Zone 3.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The sales representatives are: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao would have to work in the same zone, but this is not possible because only one of them can be in Zone 1. 
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then either Tiao or Udall would have to work in the same zone, but this is not possible because only one of them can be in Zone 2. 
  Therefore, Quinn must work in Zone 3. This means that Stuckey and Udall must also work in Zone 3. 
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, they cannot be in Zone 1 or Zone 2. 
  So, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3, which means that there are exactly three sales representatives in Zone 3. 
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao are in Zone 1 or Zone 2. 
  Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and since Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 2. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, because Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than Zone 2.
- There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
- Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone with Parra.
- Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone with Stuckey.

Eliminating Parra and Stuckey as possible sales representatives Quinn can work with, we can look at the remaining options:
- Kim, Mahr, Tiao, and Udall are not the sales representatives that are mentioned in the given conditions as not being able to work in the same sales zone with Quinn.

Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, Tiao is the sales representative that Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone with.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To answer the question, we need to find which sales representative cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn. We know that Quinn and Parra work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall also work in the same sales zone. Therefore, the remaining representatives who are not yet assigned a sales zone are Kim, Mahr, and Tiao. We also know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. 

If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3 and Quinn must work in Zone 3. However, this would mean that Zone 3 has at least three sales representatives (Quinn, Parra, and either Stuckey or Udall), which contradicts the given information that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, and Parra must work in Zone 1. 

If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 3 and Quinn must work in Zone 3. Therefore, Stuckey must work in Zone 1 to satisfy the condition that he and Udall work in the same sales zone. This leaves Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 2, which means that either one of them can work in the same sales zone as Quinn. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives to be allocated in 3 zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  More representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We need to find the person that Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  
Elimination:
  If Kim, Mahr, or Stuckey work in the same sales zone as Quinn, then Stuckey and Udall will also be in the same zone which violates the condition that "More representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2."
  If Tiao works in the same sales zone as Quinn, then Parra will be in Zone 1 and Udall will be in Zone 2. This would mean that Stuckey will be in Zone 3, which violates the condition that "More representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2."
  If Udall works in the same sales zone as Quinn, then Parra will be in Zone 1 and Tiao will be in Zone 2. This would mean that Stuckey will be in Zone 3, which violates the condition that "More representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2."

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
Choices:
  A: Julio, Nessa
  B: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  E: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - There are only two lab sessions per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, so there can't be more than two lab assistants assigned to the same day.
  
  We know that Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's. So, Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon and Kevin's session on Thursday morning.
  Thursday afternoon lab session can be assigned to either Julio, Kevin, Rebecca, or Lan. However, as Kevin has already been assigned to Thursday morning, he cannot be assigned to another session on the same day. Rebecca should lead a session on the same day as Kevin, so she cannot be assigned to Thursday afternoon session. Lan cannot lead an afternoon session, so she is also not an option. Therefore, Julio is the only lab assistant who has not been assigned to any session that conflicts with Thursday afternoon. Hence, Julio can lead the Thursday afternoon session.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - The chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon.
Action: 
  - If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, the only possible day for Kevin and Rebecca's sessions is on Thursday or Friday.
  - If Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on Thursday or Friday, Nessa must lead an afternoon session, therefore Nessa's session will be on Friday.
  - Julio's session must take place on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Thus, Julio's session will take place on either Wednesday or Thursday, and Olivia's will take place on Thursday or Friday.
  - Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, Lan's session must take place on Wednesday, and thus Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  - Therefore, the lab assistant that could lead the Thursday afternoon session is Julio.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - The lab has six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
  - Each assistant can only lead one morning session and one afternoon session.
  
Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, this means that Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon. 
According to the constraint, Julio's session must be held earlier in the week than Olivia's. This means Julio's session is on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session is on Thursday afternoon.

We need to find a list of lab assistants that could lead the Thursday afternoon session. The options are:
  A: Julio, Nessa
  B: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  E: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca
  
We know that Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session, and therefore, Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session either (because Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day). Therefore, the only possible lab assistants that could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1) Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2) Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3) Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4) Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5) There are six lab assistants available: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  6) Lab sessions will be held on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of the same week, one session each morning and afternoon.
  
Analysis:
  1) Kevin and Rebecca are paired and must lead sessions on the same day. Therefore, Kevin's session is either on Thursday or Friday, and Rebecca's session is on the same day.
  2) Nessa must lead an afternoon session, which means she is paired with one of the assistants having a morning session on the same day.
  3) If Kevin's session is on Thursday, then Nessa's session is on Friday. Then, Lan's session must be on Wednesday and Olivia's session on Thursday. Julio could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, A is a possible answer.
  4) If Kevin's session is on Friday, then Nessa's session must be on Friday as well. Then, Lan's session must be on Wednesday and Olivia's session on Thursday. Julio could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, A is a possible answer.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - There are six lab assistants available: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six sessions in total, one each morning and afternoon, scheduled over three days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's (which is the Friday afternoon session), then Rebecca must also lead a Friday session since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday since he must lead a session on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Olivia's session would then be on Thursday morning, leaving Lan to lead Thursday afternoon. Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, she can only lead on Friday afternoon. Therefore, the only lab assistants available to lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Lan.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Thursday must meet after Friday.
  Only one morning and one afternoon session can be held per day.
  
Working through the constraints:
  From Kevin and Rebecca, we know they are either both on Wednesday or both on Thursday since there is only one afternoon session per day.
  From Lan and Olivia, we know they cannot both be on Thursday, so they must be on Wednesday or Friday.
  From Nessa, we know she must be in an afternoon session, leaving only Thursday or Friday.
  From Julio, we know his session must be before Olivia's, meaning he is either on Wednesday or Thursday.
  
  Using the given information, we can determine that Kevin and Rebecca must be on Thursday. Therefore, Nessa's session must be on Friday and Julio's must be on Wednesday.
  
  Therefore, we are looking for an assistant who can lead a Thursday afternoon session. From the constraints we know that only Julio, Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca are available to lead Thursday afternoon sessions and they are as follows:
    Julio - Wednesday AM
    Kevin - Thursday AM, Thursday PM with Rebecca
    Nessa - Friday PM
    Rebecca - Thursday AM, Thursday PM with Kevin
    
  Action: Answer("C") as Kevin, Nessa and Rebecca can all lead a Thursday afternoon session.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  The lab sessions are scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session being held each morning and one each afternoon.

Since Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, we know that Kevin and Rebecca's sessions are on Wednesday and Nessa's session is on Thursday. Therefore, we can deduce that:

  - Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning (since it must be on an earlier day than Olivia's)
  - Olivia's session cannot be on Thursday (since Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia)
  
This leaves the lab assistants that could lead the Thursday afternoon session, which are Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
- There are 6 lab assistants in total: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
- The lab sessions will be held over 3 days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
- There will be 1 session per lab assistant per day, 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon.

We know that Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, so Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's must be on Friday afternoon. 

That means:
- Julio's session must be on Wednesday (since his session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's)
- Lan and Olivia must lead sessions on Wednesday and Friday (but we don't know which is which yet)
- Rebecca cannot lead a Thursday session because she must lead a session on the same day as Kevin, and Kevin's session is Thursday afternoon

Therefore, the possible lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are: Julio, Nessa, Lan, and Olivia.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then it is not on Friday since there are no sessions after Nessa's.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  We need to find a list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session.
 
Analysis: 
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then it must be either Wednesday morning or Thursday morning since there are no sessions after Nessa's. If Kevin's session is on Wednesday morning, then Nessa's session is on Wednesday afternoon, which is not possible since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Hence, Kevin's session is on Thursday morning and Nessa's session is on Thursday afternoon. Therefore, Julio cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must be on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia must be on different days
  3. Nessa has to lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  6. There are six lab sessions: 3 in the morning and 3 in the afternoon.
  
To start, we know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session. We also know that Kevin and Rebecca are on the same day. This means that Kevin and Rebecca must either both be morning lab sessions or both be afternoon lab sessions. 

If Nessa leads the Friday afternoon session, then Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Thursday afternoon session. So, if Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday, which means Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Thursday. 

Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they cannot be on Thursday. And since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Julio cannot be on Friday. 

Therefore, the lab assistants who could lead Thursday afternoon session are Kevin and Rebecca.

The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which one of the following is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform in six slots. 
  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs earlier than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform earlier than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, Wellspring could perform in slot 4 or later.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.

If Zircon performs before Yardsign, then the order of the bands must be one of the following: 

   1    2    3    4    5    6
[____][Zirc][Yard][____][____][____]
[____][Zirc][Yard][____][____][_____]
[____][Zirc][Yard][____][____][_____]
[____][Zirc][____][Yard][____][_____]
[____][Zirc][____][Yard][____][_____]

Wellspring can perform in slots 2, 3, or 4 according to constraints 2. and 5. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - Six bands will perform in just one slot each.
  - The order must meet the following constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  - Based on the constraints, we know that Yardsign will perform in slot 3. 
  - Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Xpert, which means that both Wellspring and Zircon perform in either slot 1 or 2.
  - If Zircon performs in slot 1, then the earliest slot for Wellspring is 2. If Zircon performs in slot 2, then the earliest slot for Wellspring is 1. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered 1 through 6.
  - Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—will fill the slots.
  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which is only possible if Yardsign performs in slot 3, then slots 1, 2, and 3 will be occupied, leaving slots 4, 5, and 6 for the remaining bands.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
- Vegemite must perform before Zircon.
- Wellspring and Zircon must perform before Xpert.
- Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
- Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
- If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon has to play in one of slots 1, 2 or 3, and Yardsign has to play in one of slots 4, 5 or 6.
- There are 2 bands, Uneasy and Xpert, that have to play after Zircon.

Reasoning:
- If Zircon is playing in slot 1 or slot 2, then Wellspring has to play in slot 2 or slot 3. Because Wellspring needs to play before Xpert, so it can't be slot 1.
- If Zircon is playing in slot 3, then Wellspring has to play in slot 2. (Zircon and Wellspring before Xpert)
- If Zircon is playing in slot 4, then Yardsign has to play in slot 6, which leaves slot 5 for Wellspring. (Yardsign in slot 6 to satisfy condition, Uneasy and Xpert in 4, 5)
- If Zircon is playing in slot 5, then Yardsign has to play in slot 6, which leaves slot 4 for Wellspring. (Yardsign in slot 6 to satisfy condition, Uneasy in 4, Xpert in 6)
- If Zircon is playing in slot 6, then Yardsign has to play in slot 4 or slot 5, which means Wellspring has to play in slot 3. (Zircon in 6, Yardsign in 4 or 5, Uneasy in 3, Xpert in 5 or 4)

Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 3.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform in six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot three.
  
Process:
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign performs in slot three. 
  - Therefore, we have the following order for the first three slots: Yardsign, Vegemite, and Zircon. 
  - According to the second constraint, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Since Zircon has already performed in slot two, the next slot where Wellspring can perform is slot four, after Xpert.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
 - Vegemite must perform before Zircon.
 - Wellspring and Zircon each perform before Xpert.
 - Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
 - Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
- If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then the slots 1 and 2 are already occupied by Yardsign and Vegemite respectively.
- Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot 3, 4, or 5, since both it and Zircon must perform before Xpert.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Vegemite has to perform before Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  4. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  5. Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  
Process:
  1. Yardsign has to perform in one of the first three slots.
  2. Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  3. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot 3. So, it has to perform in slot 1 or slot 2.
  4. If Zircon performs in slot 1 or slot 2, then Wellspring and Xpert will perform in slot 3 or slot 4. Wellspring cannot perform in slot 1 or slot 2. So, Wellspring will perform in slot 4 or later.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is 4.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform.
  Vegemite has to perform before Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon have to perform before Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
Logic:
  Yardsign has to perform in one of the first three slots.
  If Zircon performs before Yardsign, then Zircon will perform in slot 2.
  Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon will perform in slot 1 and slot 2, respectively.
  Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, which means that Uneasy will perform in slot 4, slot 5, or slot 6.
  There are no constraints on Vegemite, so Vegemite could perform in slot 3, slot 4, slot 5, or slot 6.
  Xpert must perform in slot 6.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 1.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
- Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
- If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon cannot be in slot 3 since Yardsign must be in one of the first three slots.
- Therefore, Zircon can only be in slot 2 or slot 1 if Yardsign performs in a later slot than Zircon.

Analysis: 
- If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Wellspring must perform in either slot 2 or slot 3 since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. 
- If Wellspring performs in slot 2, then Zircon must be in slot 1 and Vegemite must be in slot 3. 
- If Wellspring performs in slot 3, then Vegemite must be in slot 2 and Zircon must be in slot 1. 
- Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, which means it can only be in slot 4, 5, or 6. 
- Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, which means it can only be in slot 1, 2, or 3.

Action: Answer("B") 
- Wellspring must perform in either slot 2 or slot 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited third or fourth.
  If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then Villas must have been recruited either fifth or sixth.
  Since there are only seven accomplices, it follows that Tao must have been recruited either first, second, fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton must have been recruited third, fourth, or seventh. 
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero and Quinn was third, then Rovero must have been fourth.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
If Stanton was recruited first, then Tao must have been recruited either second or seventh, but neither is possible given the information we have. If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao must have been recruited first or seventh, but again neither is possible. However, if Stanton was recruited third, then Tao could have been recruited either first or second, which is consistent with the initial information that the criminal recruited the accomplices one at a time. Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited first.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited third and Rovero must have been recruited fourth, right after Peters. Then, Villas must have been recruited fifth and White sixth. This leaves only Stanton and Tao to be recruited first and seventh, and we cannot determine which one was recruited first. Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, Stanton could have been recruited first, second, or seventh.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero: 
    Quinn should be recruited earlier than Rovero.
    Thus, the order could be Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White or Peters, Tao, Stanton, Rovero, Quinn, Villas, White.
    In both orders, Stanton was recruited third.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Peters must have been the first to be recruited, followed by Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, and Tao or Stanton.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then Tao must have been recruited second and the order of Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, and Rovero can be determined.
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then Tao must have been recruited sixth and the order of Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, and Rovero can be determined.
  
Analysis: 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices must be Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao or Stanton. 
  
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of the accomplices must be Stanton, Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, and Tao, which is not possible. 
  
  If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of the accomplices must be Peters, Stanton, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, and Tao, which is possible. 
  
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of the accomplices must be Peters, Villas, Stanton, White, Quinn, Rovero, and Tao, which is not possible because Stanton was not recruited immediately after Tao. 
  
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of the accomplices must be Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Stanton, Rovero, and Tao, which is not possible because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of the accomplices must be Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, and Stanton, which is possible.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.

If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is: Peters, [unknown], [unknown], Quinn, Rovero, [unknown], White. Because Peters was recruited fourth, the order is: [unknown], [unknown], Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White. We know that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao, so the order is not: Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White. This means that Stanton must have been recruited either first, second, fifth, or seventh.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn and Rovero have to be recruited consecutively. 
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero and Peters was recruited fourth, then the order of the recruits could be Quinn, Peters, Rovero, and then four other recruits.
  As Villas was recruited immediately before White and Peters was recruited fourth, then Villas must be one of the first three recruits, and White must be one of the last four recruits.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must be one of the four recruits between Peters and Villas.
  Therefore, the order of the recruits could be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White or Peters, Rovero, Quinn, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. 
  
  If Quinn was indeed recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order must be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, and it would be impossible for Stanton to be the third recruit. If Stanton was the third recruit, then the order would be Peters, Quinn, Stanton, Rovero, and this is inconsistent with Quinn being immediately before Rovero. Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is:
  (1) Quinn
  (2) Rovero
  Thus, we can infer that Stanton was recruited neither second nor fifth, because Stanton was not immediately before or after Tao.
  
Choices:
  A: first - It is possible that Stanton was recruited first, because there is no information that contradicts this possibility.
  B: second - If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited second. This is the correct answer.
  C: third - It is possible that Stanton was recruited third, because there is no information that contradicts this possibility.
  D: fifth - If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited fifth. 
  E: seventh - It is possible that Stanton was recruited seventh, because there is no information that contradicts this possibility.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn cannot be the first person to be recruited, and Rovero cannot be the first person to be recruited.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order in which the first three people were recruited must be one of the following three:
  1. Peters, Villas, White
  2. Villas, Peters, White
  3. Villas, White, Peters
  
  In any of the above cases, Stanton can only be recruited as the fifth person or later, because he cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Stanton can't be the first, second, or third person to be recruited.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero and Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Rovero must be recruited sixth.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Rovero must be recruited sixth and Quinn must be recruited fifth.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Tao must be recruited third and Stanton must be recruited second or seventh.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White must be recruited seventh. 
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order would be Peters, Tao, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Stanton, which would satisfy all the conditions.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CAN be recruited either second or seventh.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  2. Peters was recruited fourth.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, the order of the accomplices would be:
  1. ???
  2. ???
  3. ???
  4. Peters
  5. Quinn
  6. Rovero
  7. ???
  
  From (1) and (3), we know that Villas was not recruited after White, so the order of the accomplices must be:
  1. Stanton
  2. Tao
  3. Villas
  4. Peters
  5. Quinn
  6. Rovero
  7. White
  
  From (2), we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. This means that Quinn must have been recruited either third or fourth. 
  
  Action: Answer("A") 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn would be the fifth accomplice recruited, and Stanton could not have been recruited first. Therefore, Stanton CANNOT have been recruited first.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. The six-member band perform exactly one solo each.
  2. Restrictions:
    a. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    b. The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
    c. The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
    d. The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does (but not both).
  3. We need to determine what must be true if the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  
Analysis: 
  We know that the percussionist performs before the saxophonist. There are two possibilities:
    1. The percussionist performs before the trumpeter, and the saxophonist performs after the trumpeter
    2. The percussionist performs before the saxophonist and the saxophonist performs after the trumpeter.
  We know that the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the saxophonist cannot perform after the keyboard player. We also know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. We know from the restrictions that the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist. Therefore, the violinist performs before the guitarist. 
  
Answer: Answer("D") - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Six members of the band each perform exactly one solo.
  - Restrictions:
    - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
    - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
    - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
    
Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, it means that the saxophonist should perform a solo after the percussionist does. According to the restrictions, the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, and the keyboard player performs before the guitarist. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, hence the guitarist performs the last solo. Therefore, the order of the solos will be:
Percussionist, Keyboard player, Violinist, Saxophonist, Trumpeter, Guitarist.
Now, the percussionist performed before the trumpeter and the saxophonist performed after the percussionist. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform after the trumpeter does. Therefore, the only option that is guaranteed to be true is that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. Hence, the answer is D.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band and each one performs exactly one solo. 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. 
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Analysis: 
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform the solo after the percussionist has performed but it is not necessary that the percussionist be the first one to perform. 
  Therefore, we can eliminate option A.
  As the percussionist performs the solo before the keyboard player, and the keyboard player performs the solo before the guitarist, we can eliminate option B.
  Option C could be true if the violinist performs the solo before the saxophonist but it is not necessarily true, so we cannot select this option.
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist, then we can eliminate option D because it states that the percussionist performs the solo before the trumpeter.
  If the saxophonist performs the solo after the percussionist, then we know that the saxophonist performs the solo after the percussionist but it is not necessary that the saxophonist performs the solo after the keyboard player. Therefore, we can eliminate option E.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are six band members.
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.

Solution:
  - If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then we can conclude that the percussionist performs either the first or second solo.
  - From the given information, we know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - Also, the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist must perform after either the trumpeter or the keyboard player, which is not possible as we do not know the position of the keyboard player.
  - Therefore, the percussionist must perform the second solo.
  - This means that the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  - Hence, we cannot determine if the violinist performs before or after the saxophonist.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. The band has 6 members: guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, and violinist.
  2. Each member performs exactly one solo.
  3. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  4. The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  5. The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  6. The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does but not both.

Analysis:
  Based on the given information, we can conclude that the saxophonist performs the 5th or 6th solo. If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, it means the percussionist performs the first, second, or third solo. Then:
  - From (4), we know that the keyboard player performs a solo after the percussionist does, so the keyboard player performs the fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  - From (5), we know that the violinist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, so the violinist performs the first, second, or third solo.
  - From (6), we know that the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does but not both.

Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the percussionist performs a solo before the fourth solo, which means the percussionist performs the first, second, or third solo. Then, from the given options, the only one that must be true is that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does (D).
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Each band member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, it means that the saxophonist's solo is the last one.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the order of the solos must be one of the following: 
      1- Percussionist, Trumpeter, Violinist, Keyboard, Saxophonist, Guitarist
      2- Percussionist, Trumpeter, Violinist, Saxophonist, Keyboard, Guitarist
      3- Trumpeter, Percussionist, Violinist, Keyboard, Saxophonist, Guitarist
      4- Trumpeter, Percussionist, Violinist, Saxophonist, Keyboard, Guitarist
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, and the keyboard player performs a solo before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, the saxophonist must be the last one to perform, so the violinist must perform before the saxophonist. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Each member of the six-member band performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, it means the saxophonist solo can be either the fifth or the sixth. Since the percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, and the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, we can infer that the percussionist must perform before the violinist as well. Therefore, the percussionist can perform either the first or the second solo. However, we know from the restrictions that the guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, and that the saxophonist performs after the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. So, if the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist must perform the fifth solo. If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist must perform the sixth solo. In both cases, the percussionist performs a solo before the trumpet player does. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 solos, one for each member of the band.
  The guitarist doesn't perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player, but after the saxophonist or the trumpeter.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then there are two possible scenarios:
  1) The percussionist performs before the trumpeter, and the saxophonist performs after the percussionist.
  2) The saxophonist performs after the trumpeter, and the percussionist performs before the saxophonist and therefore before the trumpeter.
  In both scenarios, the percussionist must perform before the fourth solo, which means that the percussionist must perform either the first or the second solo. So, options (A) and (B) are possible. 
  Option (C) says that the violinist performs a solo before the saxophonist, but we don't know that for sure. It only says that the saxophonist performs after the violinist.
  Option (D) says that the percussionist performs before the trumpeter, but we don't know that for sure either. It only says that the percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  Option (E) says that the saxophonist performs before the keyboard player, but we don't know that for sure either. It only says that the saxophonist performs after the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the six members performs exactly one solo.
  - One of the restrictions is that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - Another restriction is that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  We are given that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  
  A: We cannot determine whether the percussionist performs the first solo or not.
  B: Since we know that the percussionist performs before the saxophonist and the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both, we can't determine whether the percussionist performs the second solo or not.
  C: We know that the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does. Therefore, we can't say that the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist.
  D: Since we are given that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist, we can't say that the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: Since we are given that the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist or the trumpeter does, but not both, we can't say that the saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  
  Therefore, none of the choices are true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band and each performs exactly one solo.
  - The restrictions are:
    - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player does.
    - The keyboard player performs after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
    - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Explanation: Since the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, there are two cases:
  1. The percussionist performs the first solo.
  2. The percussionist performs the second solo.
In both cases, the violinist performs before the saxophonist and the guitarist performs after the saxophonist. Therefore, we can rule out choices C, D, and E. The only remaining options are A and B.

Context: A naturalist will give five lectures, each on a different type of bird: oystercatchers, petrels, rails, sandpipers, or terns. The lectures must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium, in an order that meets the following conditions: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - First lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - Fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  - Sandpipers lecture is in Howard Auditorium and given earlier than the Oystercatchers lecture.
  - Terns lecture is given earlier than the Petrels lecture, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
Action: 
  We start by drawing a table of the different lectures and possible locations, and filling in the conditions we have:
  
|       | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4               | 5          |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|------------|
| Hall  | Gladwyn|        |        | Howard         |            |
| Bird  |        |        |        |                |            |
  
  - First lecture is in Gladwyn Hall
|       | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4               | 5          |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|------------|
| Hall  | Gladwyn|        |        | Howard         |            |
| Bird  |        |        |        |                |            |
  
  - Fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium
|       | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4               | 5          |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|------------|
| Hall  | Gladwyn|        |        | Howard         |            |
| Bird  |        |        |        |                |            |
  
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall  
    - First lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, so two more lectures need to be in Gladwyn Hall.
|       | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4               | 5          |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|------------|

| Bird  |        |        |        |                |            |
  
  - Sandpipers lecture is in Howard Auditorium and given earlier than the Oystercatchers lecture
    - Sandpipers lecture is already set to be in Howard Auditorium, so the Oystercatchers cannot be in Howard Auditorium.
|       | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4               | 5          |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|------------|
| Hall  | Gladwyn|        | Gladwyn| Howard         |            |
| Bird  |        |        |        | Sandpipers      |            |
  
  - Terns lecture is given earlier than the Petrels lecture, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
    - The Petrels lecture must be after the Terns lecture, and in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the Terns lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall.
|       | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4               | 5          |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|------------|
| Hall  | Gladwyn| Howard | Gladwyn| Howard         |            |
| Bird  |        | Rails  |        | Sandpipers      | Petrels    |
  
  From here, we can eliminate some of the options:
  - A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. (Could be true)
  - B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. (Could be false)
  - C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. (Could be false)
  - D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. (Could be true)
  - E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. (Must be false)

- The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

A: If the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, the second lecture cannot also be in Gladwyn Hall because exactly three of the lectures must be in Gladwyn Hall. This could be true if the second lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
B: It is possible that both the second and third lectures are in Howard Auditorium. This satisfies all the given conditions.
C: The second lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall if the lecture on petrels (which is in Gladwyn Hall) is after the lecture on terns (which is given earlier than the lecture on petrels). Therefore, this must be false.
D: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so the third lecture cannot also be in Howard Auditorium. This must be false.
E: The third lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall if the lecture on sandpipers (which is in Howard Auditorium) is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. Therefore, this must be false.

Action: Answer("C")

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - First lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - Fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  - Exactly three lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  - Sandpiper lecture is in Howard Auditorium and is earlier than Oystercatchers lecture.
  - Terns lecture is earlier than Petrels lecture, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  Based on these conditions, we can try to eliminate the options that must be true.
  - A: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and the second lecture can't be in Gladwyn Hall because at least one of Petrels or Oystercatchers is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, A must be false.
  - B: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so the second and third lectures can't both be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, B must be false.
  - C: Both Petrels and Oystercatchers can't be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, C must be false.
  - D: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so the third lecture can't be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, D must be false.
  - E: The third lecture is either Petrels or Oystercatchers, both of which can't be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, E must be false.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The first lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium.
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  - The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
A: If the first lecture is in Gladwyn, it is not possible for the second lecture to also be in Gladwyn since only three lectures can be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, this statement could be true.
B: The fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium, so the second and third lectures cannot both be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, this statement must be false.
C: The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers, so the lecture on oystercatchers must be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the second and fifth lectures cannot both be in Gladwyn Hall. This statement could be true.
D: The fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium, so the third lecture cannot also be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, this statement could be true.
E: The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the third lecture must be in Howard Auditorium. This means the fifth lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, this statement must be false.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: There are five lectures that must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium. The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
 
A: If the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, the second lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall since exactly three of the lectures must be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the first and second lectures cannot be both in Gladwyn Hall. This option could be true.
 
B: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium and the second lecture cannot be in Howard Auditorium since that would mean that the third lecture, which is also in Howard Auditorium, is the last lecture and not the fourth one. Therefore, the second and third lectures cannot be both in Howard Auditorium. This option could be true.
 
C: If the lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels and the lecture on petrels is in Gladwyn Hall, then the lecture on terns cannot be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the second and fifth lectures cannot be both in Gladwyn Hall. This option could be true.
 
D: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium and the third lecture cannot also be in Howard Auditorium since there are only two lectures in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, the third and fourth lectures cannot be both in Howard Auditorium. This option could be true.
 
E: The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. Since the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, the oystercatchers lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall as it cannot be the first lecture and it must be after the sandpipers lecture. Therefore, the third and fifth lectures cannot be both in Gladwyn Hall. This option is false.
 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Solution:
  If the second lecture is in Howard Auditorium, then the third lecture cannot be in Howard Auditorium; it would have to be in Gladwyn Hall, which would mean that four lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, which is not allowed. Thus, B must be false.
  If the third lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, then the fifth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium, violating the condition that three lectures must be in Gladwyn Hall. Thus, C must be false.
  If the third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium, then the lecture on sandpipers (which must be earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers) would have to be the first lecture, which is not allowed. Thus, D must be false.
  If the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, the second lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall, as only three lectures can be in Gladwyn Hall. Thus, A must be false.
  That leaves E as the only option that has not been eliminated, but it does not violate any of the given conditions, so it is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The lectures must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium.
  - The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.

  - The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  - The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Let's analyze the answer choices:
A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This is possible since the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and there are five lectures in total. So, this must not be the false statement. 
B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. This is possible if the second lecture is on sandpipers, which is in Howard Auditorium, and the third lecture is on oystercatchers, which is in Gladwyn Hall. So, this must not be the false statement.
C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This is not possible since exactly three of the lectures must be in Gladwyn Hall. So, this must be the false statement.
D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. This is possible since the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, and there are five lectures in total. So, this must not be the false statement.
E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This is not possible since the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium, and it is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers, which must be in Gladwyn Hall. So, this must be the false statement.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  Sandpipers lecture is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

To determine which statement is false, we need to use the given conditions to create a schedule of the lectures:
1. Gladwyn Hall - oystercatchers

D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. - False, the third lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. - True, they are both in Gladwyn Hall.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - First lecture is in Gladwyn Hall
  - Fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall
  - Sandpipers lecture is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the oystercatchers lecture
  - Terns lecture is given earlier than the petrels lecture, which is in Gladwyn Hall
  
  A: If the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, then the second lecture must be in Howard Auditorium.
  B: If the second lecture is in Howard Auditorium, then the third lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall. This is possible since the terns lecture could be the third lecture and it is given earlier than the petrels lecture.
  C: If the second and fifth lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, then the third lecture must be in Howard Auditorium, but this is not possible since the lecture on sandpipers, which is required to be in Howard Auditorium, is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  D: If the third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium, then the fifth lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall. However, this is not possible since the lecture on terns, which is required to be given earlier than the lecture on petrels, is not the fourth lecture.
  E: If the third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall, then the second lecture must be in Howard Auditorium. This is possible since the petrels lecture, which is required to be in Gladwyn Hall, could be the first lecture, followed by the sandpipers lecture in Howard Auditorium, then the terns lecture in Gladwyn Hall, and finally the oystercatchers and rails lectures in Gladwyn Hall and Howard Auditorium, respectively.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students display 2 paintings each, one oil and one watercolor.
  - Two paintings are displayed on each of the four walls, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then:
  - No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, neither Franz's oil or Isaacs's watercolor may be displayed on wall 2.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, at least one oil painting must be displayed on wall 2.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, the second painting on wall 2 must be painted by one of the two remaining students: Greene or Hidalgo.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's watercolor cannot also be on wall 2.
  Therefore, the only possibility for the second painting on wall 2, is Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The exhibition has four walls, each with an upper and a lower position, displaying a total of eight paintings.
  Each student displays exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Analysis: 
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we know that:
  1. One of Hidalgo's painting is on wall 2.
  2. Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2, because no wall can have only watercolors.
  3. No wall can have only one student's work. Therefore, Hidalgo's second painting, which is a watercolor, must be on another wall. 
  4. Neither Franz nor Isaacs can have a painting on wall 2, because there cannot be a wall with both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
  5. By contrapositive, if wall 2 has a painting by Franz or Isaacs, then it cannot have a painting by Hidalgo. 

Action: Answer("E") 
  Since Hidalgo's paintings occupy wall 2 and another wall, and Franz and Isaacs cannot have paintings on wall 2, then the only option that is left is Isaacs's watercolor, which can be on wall 2 along with Hidalgo's oil.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on Wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors on it.
  No wall has only one student's work on it.
  No wall has both Franz's and Isaacs's works on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed on the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Possible answers:
  A: Franz's oil cannot be displayed on Wall 2 because no wall can have both Franz's and Isaacs's works on it.
  B: Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on Wall 2 because it is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  C: Greene's oil cannot be displayed on Wall 2 because no wall can have only one student's work on it.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on Wall 2 because no wall can have only watercolors on it.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor could be displayed on Wall 2 because there is no restriction that prevents it from being displayed on that wall.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Action: Answer("E") 

If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then one of the paintings displayed on wall 2 is by Hidalgo. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, the other painting on wall 2 must be an oil painting.  The other student that has an oil painting left is Isaacs, whose oil painting is displayed on the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor could be displayed on wall 2. Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
First, let's determine which paintings are already on wall 2. Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, the other painting on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's watercolor. Also, since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, the other painting on wall 2 must be painted by a different student. 

A: Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2, since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
B: Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2, since it is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
C: Greene's oil could be displayed on wall 2, since it is painted by a different student than Hidalgo and it is not in conflict with any of the given conditions.
D: Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2, since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
E: Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2, since it is not painted by a different student than Hidalgo.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students displaying two paintings each (oil and watercolor).
  - Each of the four walls will display exactly two paintings (upper and lower) and no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - Wall 4 has Isaacs' oil in the lower position.
  - Wall 1 has neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs' painting in it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall where Franz's oil is displayed.
  - If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, there cannot be Isaacs' oil or watercolor, nor Franz's oil.
  
Analysis: 
  - If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, there cannot be Isaacs' oil or watercolor, nor Franz's oil.
  - Based on the condition that "No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it", we can eliminate Isaacs' watercolor as an option for wall 2.
  - Wall 2 must have one oil and one watercolor painting, and it cannot be a painting by Hidalgo, so we can eliminate Hidalgo's watercolor as an option for wall 2.
  - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall where Franz's oil is displayed, we can eliminate Greene's watercolor as an option for wall 2.
  - This leaves us with two options for wall 2: Franz's oil and Greene's oil.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  Since Hidalgo's oil is already displayed in the lower position of wall 2, it is not possible for Hidalgo's watercolor to also be displayed on wall 2, as no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Also, no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither of Isaacs's paintings can be displayed on wall 2. This leaves only Franz's oil as a possible option, as both Greene's oil and watercolor are already displayed on other walls.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The art students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs will display exactly two paintings each - an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room - walls 1, 2, 3, and 4 - with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of the wall 4.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting that will be displayed on wall 2 must satisfy all the given conditions.
  
Analysis:
  If Hidalgo's oil is on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2. Thus, we can rule out option D.
  Also, the wall that has Franz's oil cannot have Isaacs's painting. Thus, we can rule out option A.
  From the given conditions, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Thus, Option B is not correct because it would mean that Franz's watercolor is displayed on Wall 2.
  Now we are left with two options: Greene's oil and Isaacs's watercolor. Since the wall that has Franz's oil cannot have Isaacs's painting on it, the only option we are left with is Greene's oil. Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We know that exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position, so there are 8 paintings in total being displayed.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we know that there cannot be any more paintings by Hidalgo on wall 2, and there cannot be any paintings by Franz or Isaacs on wall 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the only painting by one of the other two students that can be on the same wall is Greene's oil, since we already know that Franz and Isaacs cannot have their paintings on wall 2.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We know the positions of some of the paintings, as Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, which means Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 3. 
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, we can deduce that Greene's watercolor is displayed on either wall 1 or wall 2.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, it means that Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 3.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, which means that the other painting displayed on wall 2 must be an oil painting of a different student than Hidalgo.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, which means that neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on wall 2.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
We can conclude that Greene's oil could be displayed on wall 2, as it satisfies all the given conditions.

- The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
- The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
- The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then:
- Produce is in bay 5 and livestock is in bay 4, or
- Produce is in bay 4 and livestock is in bay 5.

Analysis:
- If bay 2 is holding fuel, then bay 1 is holding grain, which violates the condition that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, A is not possible.
- If bay 4 is holding produce, then bay 3 is holding textiles, which means bay 2 is holding livestock, which violates the condition that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, B is not possible.
- If bay 4 is holding textiles, then bay 3 is holding produce, which means bay 2 is holding livestock, which violates the condition that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, C is not possible.
- If bay 5 is holding grain, then bay 4 is holding livestock and bay 6 is holding produce, which is consistent with all the conditions. Therefore, D is possible.
- If bay 5 is holding machinery, then bay 4 is holding livestock and bay 3 is holding produce, which violates the condition that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, E is not possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 6 bays numbered from 1 to 6.
  - There are 6 types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - Grain > Livestock

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Western begins before Horror.
  - Sci-fi is not on screen 3.
  - Romance is not on screen 2.
  - Horror and Mystery are on different screens.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show movies starting at 7 pm and 9 pm.
  - Screen 3 shows a movie starting at 8 pm.
  
  A: We do not know where the horror film is, so we cannot determine if it will be on screen 2.
  B: If the western and sci-fi are on the same screen, then neither of them can be shown on screen 2. Thus, the mystery can only be shown on screen 2 at 9 pm since it cannot be shown with horror. So, this option is true as it is possible.
  C: Romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1. Hence, it cannot be shown on screen 3. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  D: If the sci-fi film begins at 7 pm, then it must be on screen 1. This means the western must be on screen 2, and horror should be on screen 3. However, this contradicts the condition that the western begins before the horror. Hence, this option is not possible.
  E: If the western begins at 8 pm, then it will be on screen 3, and sci-fi will be on one of the screens 1 or 2. This satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, this option is true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western. 
  - They are shown exactly once on one of the three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M. 
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the horror film must be on a different screen from the mystery. The romance cannot be on screen 2, and the sci-fi cannot be on screen 3.

  A: The horror film cannot be on screen 2 because the mystery is on a different screen.
  B: The mystery can be on screen 2 at 9 P.M. since it is not on the same screen as the horror film.
  C: The romance cannot be on screen 3 because the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M. since all screen 3 shows start at 8 P.M.
  E: If the western begins at the 7 P.M. showing on screen 1, then the sci-fi film would need to be on screen 2 and start at 9 P.M.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  There are three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each at 7 P.M. and 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows one movie at 8 P.M.
  The western starts before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror and mystery movies are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, it cannot be shown on screen 3 since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. Therefore, the western and the sci-fi movie must be shown on screen 1 or 2. Since the Western starts before the horror film, the horror movie cannot be shown on the same screen as the Western and sci-fi movie. Therefore, the horror movie must be shown on screen 3. The mystery movie cannot be shown on the same screen as the horror movie, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2. The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1. Finally, the remaining movie, the mystery, must be shown on screen 2.

Answer: 
  Based on the analysis, choice B is possible, so the answer is Answer("B").
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening. 
  - Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. 
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. 
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does. 
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. 
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2. 
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the horror film could be shown on screen 1 or 2, and the mystery could be shown on the other screen of 1 or 2. The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 if the horror film is on screen 2, or it must be shown on screen 2 if the mystery is on screen 1.

A: The horror film could be shown on screen 2, but it cannot be shown on the same screen as the western and the sci-fi film. Therefore, this is not necessarily true.
B: The mystery could begin at 9 P.M., but it cannot be shown on the same screen as the horror film, which must be shown before the western. Therefore, this is not necessarily true.
C: The romance cannot be shown on screen 3, which is reserved for the sci-fi film. Therefore, this is not true.
D: The sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M., as screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M. Therefore, this is not true.
E: The western must begin before the horror film does. It cannot begin at 8 P.M., as screen 3 is reserved for the sci-fi film. Therefore, this is not true.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  There are three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  Western begins before horror.
  Sci-fi is not shown on screen 3.
  Romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Horror and mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  If the western and sci-fi are scheduled on the same screen, that means one of them starts at 7 P.M. and the other one starts at 9 P.M.
  The only movie that could possibly start at 8 P.M. is romance, so it goes on screen 3.
  If horror is not on the same screen with the mystery, then either horror or mystery is shown on screen 3, and the other one is shown on one of the screens that show two movies.
  The western starts before horror, so it cannot start at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the western begins at 7 P.M., and sci-fi begins at 9 P.M.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.

Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, they will be shown on screen 1 or 2, because screen 3 cannot show the sci-fi film. 
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1 or 2, there will be two possible schedules for this evening, because we don't know which screen the horror and mystery films will be shown on. 
  Here are the two possible schedules:
    Schedule 1:
      Screen 1: Western (7 P.M.), Sci-Fi (9 P.M.)
      Screen 2: Horror (7 P.M.), Mystery (9 P.M.)
      Screen 3: Romance (8 P.M.)
    Schedule 2:
      Screen 1: Horror (7 P.M.), Western (9 P.M.)
      Screen 2: Sci-Fi (7 P.M.), Mystery (9 P.M.)
      Screen 3: Romance (8 P.M.)

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one at 7 P.M and one at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  Western starts before the horror film.
  Sci-fi is not shown on screen 3.
  Romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Horror and Mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the horror film cannot be shown on the same screen as the western. So the horror film and western must be shown on screens 1 and 2. Since western starts before the horror film, the western must start at 7 P.M. on either screen 1 or 2. Sci-fi cannot be shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on the remaining slot on screen 1 or 2. That means the horror film and mystery must be shown on the remaining screen. Romance cannot be shown on screen 2, therefore romance must be shown on screen 3. This leaves mystery to be shown at 9 P.M. and the horror film at 7 P.M on either screen 1 or 2. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The schedule includes five movies: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  The movies are shown on three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on different screens. This means that one of the horror film or the mystery must be shown on screen 3. However, we know that the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so the western and the sci-fi film cannot be scheduled to be shown on the same screen.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show 2 movies each, one at 7 P.M. and one at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows 1 movie at 8 P.M.
  - Western starts before horror.
  - Sci-fi is not shown on screen 3.
  - Romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - Horror and mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  - If the western and the sci-fi film are on the same screen, then the western starts before sci-fi.
  - Also, sci-fi is not shown on screen 3.
  - Therefore, western and sci-fi must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  - Romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1.
  - Horror and mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot be both on screen 1 or both on screen 2.
  - Since the romantic movie is on screen 1, mystery must be on screen 2 and horror must be on screen 3.
  - Western starts before horror, so western must be on screen 1 and horror must be on screen 3.
  - Therefore, sci-fi must be on screen 2.
  - Based on this analysis, the only statement that could be true is that the mystery begins at 9 P.M.
   
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Western starts before the horror film.
  2. Sci-Fi is not shown on Screen 3.
  3. Romance is not shown on Screen 2.
  4. Horror and Mystery are shown on different screens.
  5. Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 PM.
  6. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  
We are given that the Western and the Sci-Fi movie are scheduled on the same screen. That means they both should be playing on either screen 1 or 2. This also means that the Horror and Mystery movies are playing on the other screen between screens 1 and 2. Since the Western starts before the Horror movie, it means the Western must be playing on the screen that starts at 7 P.M., and the Horror movie will be playing on the screen that starts at 9 P.M. 

A: The horror movie cannot be shown on screen 2 because the Romance is not shown on screen 2. 
B: The mystery movie cannot begin at 9 P.M. since the Horror movie is already scheduled for that time slot.
C: The Romance cannot be shown on screen 3, because screen 3 only shows one movie at 8 P.M., and the Romance is not shown on screen 2.
D: The Sci-Fi movie cannot begin at 7 P.M. because the Western is scheduled for that time slot.
E: The Western cannot begin at 8 P.M. because Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
 
Therefore, the answer is none of the above.

Knowledge:
  We are looking for a band that could perform in slot one.
  We know that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  We also know that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  This means that the possible bands that could perform in slot one are the ones that could perform in the first three slots, which includes Yardsign, Vegemite, and Wellspring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find a list of bands that could perform in slot one.
  The constraints are: 
  - Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon must each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
  
Analysis: 
  We need to find a list of bands that could perform in slot one. 
  According to the constraints, Yardsign can perform in slot one. 
  Vegemite and Wellspring can also perform in slot one, as long as they perform before Zircon. 
  So, the answer should include Yardsign and either Vegemite or Wellspring. 
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and Zircon should perform after Vegemite and Wellspring. 
  This leaves us with answer choices C, D, and E.
  Answer C is incorrect because it only includes Vegemite and Yardsign, but Wellspring is also a valid option. 
  Answer D is correct because it includes all the possible bands that can perform in slot one: Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign. 
  Answer E is incorrect because it includes Zircon, which cannot perform in slot one. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  We are looking for a list of bands that could perform in slot one.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  There are six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  The order of the slots is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
  
Analysis:
  Based on the given conditions, Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots. Vegemite and Wellspring may perform in slot one, and Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, the possible bands that could perform in slot one are Vegemite and Wellspring.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The bands must be scheduled in a specific order to meet the constraints given:
  1. Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
  2. Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  3. Wellspring and Zircon must each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  4. Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.

Analysis:
  Since Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, then Yardsign must perform in slot one, slot two, or slot three. Therefore, any of the bands that do not conflict with any of the other constraints can perform on slot one. Vegemite can perform on a slot earlier than Zircon, so Vegemite can perform on slot one. Wellspring can perform in a slot earlier than Xpert, so Wellspring can perform on slot one. Therefore, the bands that could perform on slot one are Yardsign, Vegemite, and Wellspring.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  We need to find the list of bands that could perform in slot one.
  Vegemite performs earlier than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon perform earlier than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  A: Yardsign can perform in slot one, but it is not the only option.
  B: Vegemite and Wellspring can perform in slot one, but it is not the only option.
  C: Vegemite and Yardsign cannot perform in slot one as Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
  D: This is a possible list of bands for slot one. Either Vegemite, Wellspring, or Yardsign could perform in slot one.
  E: This is not a valid option as Zircon must perform in one of the later slots.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Slot one has the earliest starting time.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. 
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.

Elimination:
  A: Yardsign could perform in slot one, but it does not meet the condition that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Thus, A is not correct.
  B: Vegemite and Wellspring could each perform in slot one, but this does not meet the condition that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Thus, B is not correct.
  C: Vegemite could perform in slot one, but this does not meet the condition that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Thus, C is not correct.
  D: Vegemite and Wellspring could each perform in slot one, and Yardsign could perform in one of the other slots, but this does not meet the condition that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Thus, D is not correct.
  E: Vegemite and Wellspring could each perform in slot one, and Yardsign could perform in the other slot, meeting all the conditions. Thus, E is correct.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The band that performs in slot one has to be one of the bands that perform in the first three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, Wellspring, and Xpert. 
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  
Elimination:
  Choice A: Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, but it doesn't mean it has to be at slot one. Eliminated.
  Choice B: Vegemite and Wellspring can be at slot one, but it doesn't include Yardsign. Eliminated.
  Choice C: Vegemite and Yardsign can be at slot one, but it doesn't include other possible bands. Eliminated.
  Choice D: Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign can be at slot one, and they don't violate any constraints. Possible answer.
  Choice E: Includes Zircon, but Zircon performs in a later slot than Wellspring and Vegemite. Eliminated.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The band performing in slot one must be one that can perform in one of the first three slots.
  A: Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, therefore it could perform in slot one.
  B: Vegemite and Wellspring could perform in slots one or two, but not necessarily in slot one.
  C: Vegemite and Yardsign could perform in slots one or two, but not necessarily in slot one.
  D: Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign could perform in slots one, two, or three, therefore any one of them could perform in slot one.
  E: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, and Zircon could perform in slots one, two, three, or four, therefore any one of them could perform in slot one.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The band that performs in slot one must be one of the bands that can perform in one of the first three slots.
  A: Yardsign is the only band that can perform in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign could perform in slot one.
  B: Vegemite and Wellspring can perform in slot two or three, but they cannot perform in slot one because there are other bands that can perform in the first slot.
  C: Vegemite and Yardsign can perform in slot one or two, but there are other bands that can perform in slot one, so this list is not complete.
  D: This list is complete and accurate because each of these three bands can perform in one of the first three slots.
  E: Zircon cannot perform in one of the first three slots, so this list is not accurate.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three shelves: top, middle, and bottom. At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, it is possible that L is on the middle shelf and H is on the top shelf. In this scenario, F and M must also be on the middle shelf, leaving G, H, I, K, and O on the bottom shelf. None of the answer choices are true based on this information, so the answer is "None of the Above". 
  Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - We don't know whether H is placed on the top, middle, or bottom shelf.
  
  A: We cannot determine whether F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other or not based on the given conditions.
  B: We cannot determine whether G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other or not based on the given conditions.
  C: We cannot determine whether H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other or not based on the given conditions.
  D: We cannot determine whether I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other or not based on the given conditions.
  E: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf, and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O must be placed on the top shelf, and K must be placed on the middle shelf. Thus, K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf
  - I is on the middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M
  
If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, K and M must be on the top shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, O must be on the bottom shelf. This leaves G and H to be placed on the middle or bottom shelf. Therefore, 
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - 8 books are placed on a bookcase with 3 shelves.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - If L is placed on a higher shelf than the shelf H is placed on, then we have the following possible scenarios:
    1. L and H are on different shelves, and H is on the top shelf. 
    2. L and H are on different shelves, and H is on the middle shelf.
    3. L is on the bottom shelf, and H is on the middle or top shelf.
    4. L and H are on the same shelf, and it's not the top shelf.
    
Analysis:
  - We know that I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the same shelf as G or H, which rules out choices A and B.
  - We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so it cannot be on the same shelf as G or H, which rules out choice D.
  - If L is on the bottom shelf and H is on the middle or top shelf, then K and O must be on the bottom shelf, which rules out choice E.
  - Therefore, the only possible scenario is that L and H are on the same shelf, and it's not the top shelf, which means that H is on the middle shelf with I, and L is either on the middle or bottom shelf. This scenario does not tell us anything about the placement of G, M, K, or O, so we cannot determine which of the remaining choices must be true. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books on it.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is higher than F.
  - O is higher than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

If L is placed on a higher shelf than the shelf H is placed on, then:
  - H is not on the top shelf, because then L would have to be on the top shelf which would contradict the fact that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - H is not on the middle shelf, because then L would have to be on the top shelf which would contradict the fact that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Therefore, H is on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F and M are on the same shelf, and K is higher than F, then K and M are either on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - Since O is higher than L, and H is on the bottom shelf, then O is either on the middle or bottom shelf.
  
Choices:
  A: F and G could be on any shelf, so this is not necessarily true. 
  B: G and H are both on the bottom shelf, according to our deductions, so this must be true.
  C: We don't know where M is located, so this is not necessarily true.
  D: We don't know where G or I is located, so this is not necessarily true.
  E: K is either on the middle or bottom shelf, and O is either on the middle or bottom shelf, so this is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then it follows that H must be on the top shelf. Thus, G must also be on the top shelf since each shelf has at least two books. This means F and M must be on the same shelf as H and G, and this shelf is the top shelf. That leaves I, K, L, and O to be placed on the two remaining shelves, the middle and bottom shelves.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Each shelf has at least two books.

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, it means that L cannot be on the bottom shelf. From the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, it means that L is on the middle shelf and H is on the top shelf. Therefore, we can infer that G must be on the same shelf as H. 

Choice A is incorrect because there is no information that suggests that F and G must be placed on the same shelf as each other.
Choice B is correct based on the explanation above.
Choice C is incorrect because there is no information that suggests that H and M must be placed on the same shelf as each other.
Choice D is incorrect because there is no information that suggests that I and G must be placed on the same shelf as each other.
Choice E is incorrect because there is no information that suggests that K and O must be placed on the same shelf as each other.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - We are assuming that L and H are not on the same shelf.
  
Analysis:
- If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf, and L must be on the top or middle shelf.
- Since F is not on the top shelf, and K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf. Therefore, O must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
- Since I is placed on the middle shelf and F is placed on the same shelf as M, then G and H must be placed on the bottom shelf. 
- Therefore, the only option that must be true is that G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  8 books are placed on a bookcase, on exactly 3 shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  If L is placed on a higher shelf than H, it means that H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be either on the top or the middle shelf. If L is on the top shelf, then O, which is placed on a higher shelf than L, must be on the middle or bottom shelf, which contradicts the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf, and O must be on the bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and there are at least two books on each shelf, F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If they are on the bottom shelf, then K must also be on the bottom shelf, which contradicts the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf, and K must be on the top shelf. G and H can be on any of the remaining shelves, but they cannot be on the same shelf as each other, because each shelf must have at least two books.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf. Thus, G must also be on the top shelf, according to the condition that no shelf has only one book. This means that F and G must be on the same shelf. Therefore, the answer is A.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: The assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  E: Xu is assigned parking space #5.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The six employees are Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  If Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and he must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, then we can conclude that Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. If Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Therefore, Souza must be assigned parking space #4 or lower. This leaves Vaughn and Togowa to be assigned parking spaces #1, #2, and #3. However, we do not know the order in which they are assigned those parking spaces. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees and six parking spaces.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young > Togowa
  Xu > Souza
  Robertson > Young
  Robertson gets #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
  If Robertson gets parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, then Robertson > Young. Thus, Young cannot get #2, #3, #4, or #5. Therefore, Young must get parking space #6. Since Togowa gets a lower-numbered parking space than Young, Togowa must get #5. Since Xu must get a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Young and Togowa have already been assigned the higher-numbered parking spaces, Xu must get #3. Souza must get #1, and Vaughn must get #2.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Solution:
- According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young and he must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- So, Young can only be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
- According to the rules, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- So, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
- According to the rules, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- So, Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3 and Xu must be assigned parking space #4, #5, or #6.
- We are left with Vaughn who must be assigned one of the remaining parking spaces.
- It is clear that the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
- This is because no other employee can be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Robertson and at the same time, Robertson can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- Therefore, the answer is D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are six parking spaces (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6) and six employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young).
  Each employee must be assigned to a unique parking space.
  Young's parking space must be higher than Togowa's parking space.
  Xu's parking space must be higher than Souza's parking space.
  Robertson's parking space must be one of parking spaces #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Robertson's parking space must be higher than Young's parking space.
  
Analysis:
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young's parking space must be #5. Therefore, Xu must be assigned parking space #6 and Souza must be assigned parking space #3. Togowa will then be assigned parking space #1 and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #2. Therefore, choice D is correct. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The rules for parking space assignment are as follow:
    1. Young > Togowa
    2. Xu > Souza
    3. Robertson > Young
    4. Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    
Solution:
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 (rule 3). Then, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, and Robertson, Souza, Vaughn, and Xu must be assigned parking spaces #2, #3, #6, and #4, respectively. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - 6 employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young
  - 6 parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6
  - Each employee must be assigned one parking space only
  - No two employees can have the same parking space
  - Rules:
    1. Young must have a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    2. Xu must have a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    3. Robertson must have a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
  - If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 based on Rule 3. The only parking spaces left for Xu and Souza are #6 and #3, respectively. Therefore, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #2 based on the "no two employees can have the same parking space" rule, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #1. So, the assignment of parking spaces to each employee is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, then he must be assigned the highest parking space among all the employees because he must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Thus, the only parking spaces available for Xu, Vaughn, Souza, and Togowa are #5 and #6, but Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #5. Finally, the only parking space available for Vaughn and Togowa are #3 and #2, respectively, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Thus, Young must be assigned parking space #4, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #2. Then, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #3.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- There are six employees, and each employee must be assigned a unique parking space.
- Rules:
  - Young > Togowa
  - Xu > Souza
  - Robertson > Young
  - Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4

A: If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Xu must be assigned parking space #2, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4. This does not uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces, as Vaughn and Togowa could be assigned either #5 or #6. Therefore, A is not the answer.
B: If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4. This does not uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces, as Souza, Vaughn, and Xu could be assigned any of the remaining parking spaces. Therefore, B is not the answer.
C: If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, Robertson must be assigned parking space #2, Young must be assigned parking space #4 or #5, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. This uniquely determines the assignment of parking spaces. Therefore, C is the answer.
D: If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, Robertson must be assigned parking space #2 or #3, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6 or #1. This does not uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces, as Souza and Vaughn could be assigned either #3 or #4. Therefore, D is not the answer.
E: If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, Xu must be assigned parking space #5, Robertson must be assigned parking space #2, Young must be assigned parking space #4, and Togowa and Vaughn could be assigned either #3 or #6. This does not uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces. Therefore, E is not the answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4, which means that Young must be assigned parking space #5. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #6 and Souza must be assigned parking space #2. Now, the only available parking spaces are #1 and #3, and Vaughn must be assigned one of these spaces. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Six new employees must be assigned one of six parking spaces.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young's parking space > Togowa's parking space.
  - Xu's parking space > Souza's parking space.
  - Robertson's parking space > Young's parking space.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Eliminating choices:
  - Choice A conflicts with the given rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - Choice B conflicts with the given rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Choice C has no impact on the assignment of parking spaces to the employees.
  - Choice E has no impact on the assignment of parking spaces to the employees.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each type.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, P and R must both be selected.
  If both G and H are selected, then we know that the panel will include at least one botanist, at least one chemist, and at least one zoologist. This means that we can rule out choice A and choice B since they each only include one type of scientist. Choice E is also incorrect because it only includes zoologists as options, which we know can't be the case from the given conditions. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanist, chemist, and zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Context: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The panel is formed by selecting five scientists from three different areas (botany, chemistry, and zoology)
  - At least one scientist from each area must be selected.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, at most one zoologist can be selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected
  - K and M cannot both be selected
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, it means that there will be at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist in the panel. This also means that F will not be selected. 
  If we can determine which chemist is selected, we can determine the other two scientists as well.
  If K is selected, then M cannot be selected. This means that the third scientist must be a zoologist, either P or R. This satisfies all the conditions. 
  If M is selected, then we must select both P and R. This satisfies all the conditions. 
  Therefore, the answer must be either K or M.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each type: botanist, chemist, and zoologist.
  2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  3. F and K cannot both be selected.
  4. K and M cannot both be selected.
  5. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  G and H are among the scientists selected.
  Therefore, neither F nor G can be required to fulfill the condition of having at least one botanist.
  If G and H are both selected, then either F or K must be selected, or the condition of having at least one chemist will not be fulfilled.
  Since both K and M cannot be selected, if K is not selected, then M must be selected to fulfill the condition of having at least one chemist.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected, to fulfill the condition of having at least one zoologist.
  Therefore, if G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or else K.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected
  F and K cannot both be selected
  K and M cannot both be selected
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected
  G and H are both botanists
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  G and H must be selected, so we need to select at least one more scientist to satisfy the condition of having at least one scientist of each type. 
  If we select F, we will have two botanists and, according to the rule "If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected," we will have at most one zoologist. So, we can select K as the third scientist. 
  Therefore, the panel will include F or else K. Answer A ("F or else K") is the best answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then there are two botanists left: F and either G or H. 
  From the rule that more than one botanist cannot be selected with more than one zoologist, we know that if F is selected, then only one zoologist can be selected from P, Q, and R. 
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected, and if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Based on these rules, we can eliminate choices A, B, and E.
  Choice D is not correct because Q is a zoologist and the question says "or else Q."
  Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so if G and H are selected, then one more scientist of a different type must be selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected, so if G and H are selected, then at most one botanist can be selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected, so if F is not selected, then K can be selected and vice versa.
  K and M cannot both be selected, so if K is not selected, then M can be selected and vice versa.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected, so if M is not selected, then either P or R can be selected, but not both.
Action: Answer("A")  
If G and H are among the scientists selected, then at most one botanist can be selected. Therefore, F should be selected if no botanist has been selected. If one botanist has been selected, then K can be selected. Finally, if two botanists have been selected, then no zoologists can be selected. Since K cannot be selected if F is selected, and vice versa, the answer must be "F or else K". Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

If G and H are among the selected scientists, then the panel must include either F or K, or both if they are of different types. In addition, the panel can include one of the other botanist, one of the other chemist, and both of the other zoologists.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Approach:
  - If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we only need to worry about the remaining four spots in the panel.
  - Based on the given information, we know that the panel must include at least one of each type of scientist. Thus, we must select at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  - If we select F, then we cannot select K. Thus, we must select L or M. If we select M, then we must also select both P and R.
  - If we select K, then we cannot select F. Thus, we must select either L or M. If we select M, then we must also select both P and R.
  - If we select L, then we must select at least one botanist and one zoologist. We can select either F or G as the botanist, and either P or Q as the zoologist.
  - If we select neither F nor K, then we must select both G and H. In this case, we can select either L or M as the chemist, and either P or Q as the zoologist.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either... 
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, there must be at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist on the panel. 
  There are two possibilities: 
  (1) G and H are both selected from botanists, and one zoologist is also selected. In this case, F or K could be selected as the third scientist to satisfy the condition of at least one scientist from each type. 
  (2) G or H is selected from botanists, and the other is selected from either chemists or zoologists. In this case, at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist will be on the panel, and the remaining two spots could be filled by any of the remaining scientists, except for F and K or K and M. If M is selected, then both P and R must also be selected. Therefore, D is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The total number of sales representatives is seven, and they work in three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall are grouped in pairs and work in the same sales zone.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Elimination:
  A: Kim and Mahr are not paired with any of the other sales representatives, so they could both be working in either Zone 1 or Zone 2, but not in Zone 3. Eliminate.
  B: Tiao is already assigned to Zone 1 or Zone 2, so he cannot be assigned again to Zone 3. Eliminate.
  C: Parra and Quinn are paired with each other, so they must be working in the same sales zone. They cannot both be working in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Eliminate.
  D: Tiao and Udall are paired with each other. Stuckey and Udall are also paired with each other, so they must be working in the same sales zone. Therefore, Tiao and Udall are both assigned to Zone 2, leaving Stuckey as the only one assigned to Zone 3. This leaves four sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Parra, and Quinn) to be assigned to Zone 1. Therefore, this choice is possible. Keep.
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall are all paired with each other, so they must be working in the same sales zone. There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so this choice is possible. Keep.

Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are exactly seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
- Each representative works in exactly one of the three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
- From the given information, we know that Parra and Tiao cannot work in Zone 3 as one of them must work in Zone 1 and the other in Zone 2.
- Kim, Mahr, and Quinn are not assigned to any zone, so they may be assigned to any of the three zones including Zone 3.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, and they are not assigned to Zone 1, so they must work in Zone 2 or Zone 3.
- If Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 2, then there are not more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The company has exactly 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zones 1, 2, and 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  The options need to have at least 3 sales representatives since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn should be together since they work in the same Zone.
  Stuckey and Udall should also be together since they work in the same Zone.
  Tiao works either in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  Parra works either in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  Udall works either in Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  
Solution:
  Option A: Kim and Mahr are not included in the Zone 3, so this option is not possible.
  Option B: Tiao is included, but none of the other sales representatives work in Zone 3, so this option is not possible.
  Option C: Parra and Quinn are together in the same zone, but neither of them is in Zone 3, so this option is not possible.
  Option D: Tiao and Udall are included, and at least one more sales representative needs to be included to fulfill the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Stuckey is the only sales representative left that is not included in the options, so this option is possible.
  Option E: Parra and Quinn are together in the same Zone, and Stuckey and Udall are together in the same Zone, which leaves only one spot for another sales representative in Zone 3. Kim and Mahr are not included in the options, so this option is not possible.
  
Therefore, the answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives - Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones - Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we can deduce that at least three sales representatives work in Zone 3. 
  Parra cannot work in Zone 3, because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  Tiao cannot work in Zone 3, because then there would be more sales representatives working in Zone 2 than in Zone 3. 
  Udall cannot work in Zone 3, because then Stuckey would also have to work in Zone 3, which would leave only two sales representatives to work in the other two zones. 
  Kim cannot work in Zone 3, because then there would be only two sales representatives left to work in the other two zones. 
  Mahr could work in Zone 3, leaving Quinn and Stuckey to work in the other two zones. 
  Therefore, the answer is (A) Kim, Mahr.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives who work in 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we can conclude that Parra and Quinn cannot work in Zone 3 together because more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than Zone 2. And, Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. So, among the remaining sales representatives, at most two can work in Zone 2. Therefore, at least three sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  Choice A and B cannot be correct because Mahr and Tiao must work in different zones. 
  Choice C cannot be correct because Parra and Quinn cannot work in Zone 3 together.
  Choice D cannot be correct because only two sales representatives can work in Zone 2 and all three of them are assigned to it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  2. Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  3. Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  4. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  5. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  6. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Processing:
  - From conditions 2 and 6, we can infer that there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  - From condition 5, we know that Udall is working in the same sales zone as Stuckey, so both of them must be in the same sales zone. 
  - From condition 4, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, but we don't know which one.
  - From conditions 2 and 3, we know that Tiao is either in Zone 2 or Zone 1. But we don't know the location of Udall.
  - From condition 1, we know that either Parra or Tiao is working in Zone 1.
  - From condition 6, we know that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, we can eliminate choices (A) and (B) that have only one sales representative working in Zone 3. 
  - Choice (C) has only two sales representatives, and we need at least three for Zone 3. So, we can eliminate (C) also.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
  - Choice (E) has all four sales representatives Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall, and satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, it could be a complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives.
  - The sales representatives work in three sales zones.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Elimination:
  - A: Kim and Mahr cannot both work in Zone 3 because there would not be any sales representatives left to work in Zone 2.
  - B: Tiao already works in Zone 2, so Tiao cannot also work in Zone 3.
  - C: Parra and Quinn cannot both work in Zone 3 because there would not be any sales representatives left to work in Zone 1.
  - D: This could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3, as there would be two sales representatives working in Zone 1 and only one in Zone 2, satisfying the given conditions.
  - E: This list includes all seven sales representatives, which is not possible as there are only three sales zones.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  From the conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, only one of Parra and Tiao can work in Zone 3. Additionally, Stuckey and Udall must work in the same zone, so if Tiao is in Zone 2, then Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 2, leaving no one left to work in Zone 3. Therefore, Udall must be in Zone 3, and Tiao must be in Zone 1. Parra cannot be in Zone 2, so he must be in Zone 3 with Udall. The remaining representatives are Kim, Mahr, and Quinn/Stuckey. We know that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so either two or three of these representatives are in Zone 3. Therefore, the only possible list of representatives working in Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn/Stuckey, and Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We need to find a list of sales representatives that can work in Zone 3, which satisfies the above conditions.
  
Analysis:
  The number of sales representatives working in Zone 2 is limited to 1 by the condition that Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, we can have at most 6 sales representatives working in Zone 3. However, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 2 sales representatives working in Zone 3. The only options that satisfy this condition are D and E. We need to check if the other conditions are satisfied by each option.
  
Option A: Kim, Mahr - This option only has 2 sales representatives, therefore it does not satisfy the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This option is not valid.

Option B: Kim, Tiao - Tiao cannot work in Zone 3 because Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. This option is not valid.

Option C: Parra, Quinn - Quinn cannot work in Zone 3 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. This option is not valid.

Option D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This option satisfies all of the conditions.
  
Option E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - This option also satisfies all of the conditions.

Conclusion:
  Both options D and E could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("D or E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we can conclude that:
    - At least one of Parra or Tiao, and one of Tiao or Udall work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively.
    - Since more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, this means that at least three sales representatives work in Zone 3.
    - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, but we don't know which zone(s) they work in.

Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  From the analysis above, we can see that it is possible for Tiao and Udall to work in different zones and for Parra and Quinn to work in Zone 3. This would mean that Kim, Mahr, and Parra work in different zones, leaving only Stuckey and Tiao to work in Zone 3 with Udall. Therefore, a complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 could be Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall. Choice D is the only option that includes all three of these sales representatives.

Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Each week, three batches of three kinds of cookies (oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar) are made.
  - Each batch is made on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  
Action: 
  If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on the same day as the third batch of another kind of cookie, then either:
  1. The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday (to be the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies on Wednesday) and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday (to be the same day as the third batch of oatmeal cookies on Thursday), OR
  2. The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday (to be the same day as the third batch of oatmeal cookies on Tuesday) and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday (to be the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies on Thursday).
  In either case, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, so it is impossible for exactly two batches of cookies to be made on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is B. At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. Thus, Answer("B").
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  3. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  4. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  5. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  6. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Analysis:
Let's consider the first batch of cookies made as A, the second batch as B, and the third batch as C. Then according to the given conditions, we can write down the following table:

| Day       | oatmeal | peanut butter | sugar |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Monday    | A       | B             | B     |
| Tuesday   | B       | C             | A     |
| Wednesday | C       | A             | C     |
| Thursday  | A       | C             | B     |
| Friday    | C       | B             | A     |

If oatmeal's first batch is made on the same day as sugar's third batch, then oatmeal's first batch is made on Friday, and sugar's third batch is made on Wednesday. So the false statement could be one that contradicts either of these facts.

A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - This statement could be true or false and is not related to the information from the given conditions. Hence, this is not the answer.

B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - If sugar’s third batch is made on Wednesday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday. Thus, this statement could be false, making it a potential answer.

C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - The given conditions do not contradict this statement. Hence, this statement is true and not the answer.

D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - The given conditions do not contradict this statement. Hence, this statement is true and not the answer.

E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - If oatmeal’s first batch is made on Friday, then exactly two batches of cookies are made on Friday. Thus, this statement could be false, making it a potential answer.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  According to the conditions, there are only a few batches that can be made on the same day. 
  Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, we can deduce that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. 
  Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, we can deduce that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday as well. 
  We can create a schedule based on this information to answer the question.

Schedule:
Monday: oatmeal(1), peanut butter(1), sugar(1)
Tuesday: oatmeal(2), peanut butter(2), sugar(3)
Wednesday: oatmeal(3), peanut butter(3), sugar(2)
Thursday: oatmeal(1), peanut butter(3), sugar(2)
Friday: oatmeal(2), peanut butter(1), sugar(3)

Action: Answer("E") - According to the schedule, two batches of cookies are made each day except for Friday, where only one batch of each kind of cookie is made. Therefore, exactly one batch of cookies is not made on Friday, making choice E a false statement.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- There are exactly three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
- Exactly three batches of each type of cookie are made each week.
- Each batch of cookies, regardless of the type, is made on a single day.
- No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day.
- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
- At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

Action: 
- If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the earliest that the third batch can be made is on Wednesday (since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday). 
- If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Wednesday (since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies). 
- In this case, exactly two batches of cookies (the first batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies) are made on Wednesday, so the statement that "exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday" (choice D) could be false. 

Answer: D
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, it must be either that oatmeal's first batch is made on Thursday or that sugar's third batch is made on Monday. In the first case, peanut butter's first batch is made on Thursday which means that the second batch of peanut butter must be on Monday, and the third batch of that flavor must be on Tuesday. This means that no flavors are made on Wednesday, so (B) is false. In the second case, the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday and the second batch of sugar cookies must be on Tuesday. This means that there is only one batch made on Wednesday, so (A) is false. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

For this question, we can use the process of elimination. We have to check which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.

Eliminating A: "At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days" could still be true. We know that at least one batch is made on Monday, and we still need to make six more batches for the rest of the week.

Eliminating B: "At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday" could still be true. We know that there are three batches of one kind of cookie that haven't been made yet, and it is possible to make two of them on Wednesday.

Eliminating D: "Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday" cannot be true if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch. This statement implies that there are only two batches of cookies made on Tuesday, which cannot be true if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.

Eliminating E: "Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday" could still be true. We already know that two batches of sugar cookies are made on Thursday. It is possible to make one batch of the remaining kind of cookie on Friday.

So the only statement that could be false is C: "Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday." If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it is possible that no batch of cookies is made on Monday for that kind of cookie.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The bakery makes exactly 9 batches of cookies every week (3 kinds x 3 batches each).
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then there are only two possibilities:
    1. Oatmeal first and Sugar third on Wednesday. 
    2. Sugar first and Oatmeal third on Wednesday.
    
Analysis: 
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then there are only two possibilities, and both of them make statements A, B, C, D and E true. Therefore, none of the choices could be false. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  We are given that one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch. Thus, either oatmeal cookies' first batch is made on the same day as sugar cookies' third batch or peanut butter cookies' first batch is made on the same day as sugar cookies' third batch.

  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. This statement is not affected by the given condition. It can still be true.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. This statement is also not affected by the given condition. It can still be true.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. This statement is not true since we are given that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and that one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch. Thus, either two or three batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. This statement is not true since we know that oatmeal cookies' second batch is made on the same day as peanut butter cookies' first batch. Thus, oatmeal cookies' second batch and peanut butter cookies' first batch are made on the same day, which means that only one batch of each kind of cookie can be made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. This statement is not affected by the given condition. It can still be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - A bakery makes three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("B") 

If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, it means that the possible combinations are either the oatmeal cookies' first batch made on Wednesday (along with sugar cookies' third batch) or sugar cookies' third batch made on Wednesday (along with oatmeal cookies' first batch). 

Let's consider each option:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
      This statement is true because 3 batches of 3 types of cookies are made each week, so at least one batch is made on each of the five days.
  
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
      This statement could be false if the oatmeal cookies' first batch is made on Wednesday and the sugar cookies' third batch is made on Friday. In that case, only one batch of cookie is made on Wednesday.
  
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
      This statement is false because we know from the conditions that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, but not exactly one batch.

  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
      This statement is false because we know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, exactly two batches of cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.

  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
      This statement is false because we know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, and each kind of cookie has three batches. Therefore, there must be at least one batch of cookies made on Friday.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - A bakery makes three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind are made each week.
  - Each batch is made in one day, from Monday to Friday.
  - No two batches of the same kind are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: 
If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. Therefore, one of the batches of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the other is made on Wednesday. Here are the implications of these conditions:
  - Two batches of cookies are made on Monday (the third batch of sugar cookies and one of the batches of peanut butter).
  - Two batches of cookies are made on Thursday (the first batch of oatmeal cookies and the second batch of sugar cookies).
  - The other batches of oatmeal and sugar cookies are made on Tuesday and Wednesday (in some order).
  
To check which option could be false, we need to go through each one:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (This is true, as we know that batches are made every weekday.)
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (This is also true, since we know that the other two batches not made on Tuesday are made on Wednesday and Tuesday.)
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (This is false, since we know that two batches are made on Monday.)
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (This is false, since we know that only one batch is made on Tuesday.)
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (This is true, since we know that all three batches of each kind of cookie have already been made by Thursday.)

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
Choices:
  A: Quinn
  B: Ruiz
  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Three workers will be selected for a project - one of them being the leader.
  Constraints:
    - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
    - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
    - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. 
  Therefore, if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, which means that we need to select the project members from the group {Quinn, Smith, Wells, Xue}.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members and one of them will be selected as the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they lead the project.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
To find the answer, we need to find a candidate who will be selected as a project member given that Taylor is not selected. We know that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be, so we can eliminate Smith as a candidate. We also know that if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, so we can eliminate Wells as a candidate. So, we are left with the following candidates who can be project members: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, and Xue.

If we assume that Quinn or Ruiz will be the project leader, then the only way Taylor will not be a project member is if both Quinn and Ruiz are selected as project members. But we know that Ruiz can only be a project member if he is the leader, so we can eliminate Quinn and choose Ruiz as the answer.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of the project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be project members only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
  1. Choose the project leader: 7 choices
  2. Choose 2 members of the project from the remaining 6 people: 6 choose 2 = 15
  
  To apply the constraints: 
  - If Quinn or Ruiz are selected, one of them must be the leader.
  - If Smith is selected, Taylor must be selected.
  - If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  
  Since only one person can be a project leader, we can assume that the leader will be selected first and then the other two members will follow.
  
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member either because of the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. 

Action: Answer("D")  
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Wells must be a project member to ensure that neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The project has three members, one of whom is the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Since the question states that Taylor is not a project member, it means Smith is not a project member either, because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. This means we have two spots left to fill, and we know that neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is a project member. Therefore, we have two possible scenarios to consider.
  Scenario 1: Wells is not a project member. In this case, Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member, since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. This means we have two spots remaining, and we need to choose one more person to be a project member and the leader. Since Taylor is not a project member, we must choose between Verma and Xue. However, we cannot choose Verma, because if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, we must choose Xue to be the third project member and the leader.
  Scenario 2: Wells is a project member. In this case, we cannot choose Ruiz or Verma to be a project member, since neither can be a project member if Wells is a project member. Therefore, we must choose Quinn to be the third project member and the leader.
  
Action: Answer("A") since Quinn is a project member in Scenario 1.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member and Smith is a project member, it means that Taylor must also be a project member. This is contradictory, so Smith cannot be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
  It follows that Wells cannot be a project member if Ruiz or Verma must be excluded from the project as a result. 
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, at least one of Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly three workers will be selected for the project.
  2. Exactly one of the three selected workers will be the project leader.
  3. Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if that worker is the project leader.
  4. If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  5. If Wells is a project member, then Ruiz and Verma cannot be project members.
  
Since Taylor is not a project member, Smith cannot be a project member, because if Smith was a project member, then Taylor would have to be a project member as well. Therefore, we know that the three project members must be chosen from the following four workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, and Wells.  

If Wells is chosen as a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be chosen as a project member. Therefore, Quinn must be chosen as a project member, and Quinn must be the project leader since either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader.

Action: Answer("A") - Quinn must be a project member.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The team must consist of exactly three workers.
  Exactly one worker must be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  Thus, only one of the following three can be a project member: Quinn, Ruiz, or Wells.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Taylor is not a project member, Smith cannot be a project member, so we can eliminate Smith from consideration. Then, we must choose three members from the remaining six: Quinn, Ruiz (only if leading), Taylor (not possible), Verma (if Wells is not selected), Wells (if Ruix is not selected), and Xue. If Wells is selected, Ruiz and Verma cannot be selected. Therefore, Quinn, Wells, and Xue must be the project members.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. 
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. 
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member as well.
  Thus, the possible project members are among Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Wells, Verma, and Xue.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then either Quinn or Xue must be a project member.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Three workers will be selected, and one of them will be the project leader.
  - If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, they must be the project leader.
  - If Smith is selected, Taylor must be selected.
  - If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  - We are asked to find a worker who must be selected if Taylor is not a project member.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member either. 
  If Ruiz is selected, then Ruiz must be the project leader, but Quinn cannot be selected, which means that only one worker (excluding Ruiz) will be remaining. 
  Similarly, if Quinn is selected, then Quinn must be the project leader, but Ruiz cannot be selected, which means that only one worker (excluding Quinn) will be remaining. 
  Therefore, neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be the answer.
  If Verma is selected, then Wells cannot be selected, which means that there will be only one worker (excluding Verma) remaining, but this cannot happen since exactly three workers need to be selected.
  Therefore, Verma cannot be the answer.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected, which means that only Smith, Taylor, and Xue will be remaining. The project leader can either be Wells or Xue. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Wells must be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The special project will have 3 workers and one of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member to lead the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, Smith cannot be a project member as well.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member because if he is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  To satisfy the condition that Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member to lead the project, we must choose one of them as a project member. 
  We have only one position left, so we must choose Xue to be the third project member.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Quinn since Ruiz cannot be a project member.

  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. 
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. 
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that Yardsign must perform in slot 1 or 2 because Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. 

Action: Answer("D")

  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

If Vegemite performs in slot three, then the order of the slots must be:
  1. Yardsign
  2. Wellspring
  3. Vegemite
  4. Zircon
  5. Xpert
  6. Uneasy

A: Uneasy performs in a later slot than Xpert, not true.
B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, true.
C: Xpert performs in a later slot than Uneasy, not true.
D: Yardsign performs in the first slot, not true.
E: Zircon performs in a later slot than Uneasy, not true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite is in a slot before Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon are both before Xpert.
  Uneasy is in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign is in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite is in slot three.
 
Analysis:
  We know that Vegemite is in slot three, which means that only two bands could be before it: Yardsign or Wellspring. However, since we know that Yardsign has to perform in one of the first three slots, it cannot be in slot three. Therefore, Wellspring must be in slot one or two. This means that Zircon has to be in one of the first two slots. Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, it must be in slot five or six. This leaves Xpert to be in slot four.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Uneasy must perform in either slot five or slot six.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, the order will be: 1) Yardsign, 2) Wellspring, 3) Vegemite, 4) Zircon, 5) Xpert, 6) Uneasy.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
- Vegemite performs in slot three.

Reasoning:
- Since Vegemite performs in slot three, Yardsign must perform in either slot one or two to meet the constraint that it performs in one of the first three slots.
- Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two, but it is unknown which performs in which slot.
- Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, it cannot perform before Xpert.

Action: Answer("D") 
Since Wellspring and Zircon performs in slots one and two, respectively, and Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, it follows that Yardsign performs in slot one or two. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Six bands-- Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon, will perform in six slots numbered one through six.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.

Analysis:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that Zircon must perform in a later slot. Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot five or six, since it must perform in one of the last three slots. Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Zircon must perform after Vegemite, Wellspring must perform in slot one or two. Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, and Wellspring performs in slot one or two, Yardsign must perform in slot one. This leaves only slot four for Xpert to perform.

Action: Answer("B") Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - A benefit concert has 6 slots that will be filled by 6 different bands.
  - The slots are numbered from 1 to 6.
  - The order must meet the following constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Vegemite performs in slot 3.
  
  A: It is possible, but not necessarily true. We can't determine if Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert from the given information.
  B: This is true, since Zircon must perform in a later slot than Vegemite, and both Wellspring and Zircon must perform in earlier slots than Xpert. Therefore, Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  C: This is not true, since Xpert must perform in a later slot than Wellspring and Zircon, and it is not known whether Uneasy performs before or after Xpert.
  D: This is not true, since Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, and it is not known whether Wellspring performs before or after Yardsign.
  E: This is not true since Zircon must perform in a later slot than Vegemite, but it is not known whether Uneasy performs before or after Zircon.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The criminal recruited seven accomplices, one at a time. 

Using the given information, we can create a timeline of the order in which the criminal recruited their accomplices:

1. Quinn
2. ??? (Stanton cannot be second because he was not recruited immediately before or after Tao)
3. Rovero
4. Peters
5. Villas
6. White
7. Tao

If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must be last in the order. We also know that Villas was recruited before White, so Villas must be fifth in the order. 

This leaves us with the following possibilities:

1. Quinn, Stanton, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White, Tao
2. Quinn, Stanton, Rovero, Peters, Villas, Tao, White

Option A is not possible because if Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero could not have been recruited after him. Option B is possible, as Rovero could have been recruited third. Option C is not possible because if Stanton was recruited second, then Tao could not have been recruited last. Option D is not possible because Tao must be last. Option E is also not possible because Villas must be fifth.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
- Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
- Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White.
- Peters was recruited fourth.

Action: 
If White was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then we know that Tao was recruited last, Rovero was recruited sixth, and White was recruited fifth because only the last two people recruited are mentioned. We also know that Peters was recruited fourth, which means that Quinn must have been recruited first because Quinn had to be recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, one possible order of recruitment could be: Quinn, Villas, Stanton, Peters, White, Rovero, Tao. 

The question asks for which of the following could be true, so we need to check which answer choice is consistent with this possible order of recruitment:
A) Quinn was recruited first: True, according to the possible order of recruitment provided above.
B) Rovero was recruited third: False, according to the possible order of recruitment provided above.
C) Stanton was recruited second: False, according to the possible order of recruitment provided above.
D) Tao was recruited sixth: True, according to the possible order of recruitment provided above.
E) Villas was recruited sixth: False, according to the possible order of recruitment provided above.

Therefore, the answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The criminal recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, we can conclude that the order of recruitment for these three accomplices is White, Rovero, Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth and Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, the order of recruitment is Peters, (unknown), (unknown), Villas, White, Rovero, Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, Quinn cannot be the first to be recruited. Moreover, since Rovero came after White, he cannot be the third to be recruited. Therefore, the only possible option is Tao was recruited sixth.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. Tao and Stanton were not recruited immediately before or immediately after each other.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Peters was recruited fourth.
  5. There are a total of seven accomplices including Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  
Using statements (3) and (5), we can infer that Villas and White must be recruited last and second to last, but we don't know which order they are in. Statement (4) tells us that Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn must be recruited first, second, or third. 

If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then we can infer that Tao was recruited last. Rovero cannot be third or later since that would mean Tao was not recruited last. White must be recruited sixth if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, which means that Villas was recruited fifth. With this information we can now answer the question.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time. 
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Analysis:
  White was recruited before Rovero, and Rovero was recruited before Tao, so White was recruited before Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Peters, Stanton and Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be the last or the second to the last person to be recruited. 
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton cannot be the second person to be recruited.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.

If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order in which they were recruited must be: White, Rovero, Tao. Therefore, we can deduce the following:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth and thus cannot be recruited before Rovero and Tao.
  2. Villas was recruited immediately before White and thus cannot be recruited after White.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero and thus cannot be recruited first.
  
A: Quinn cannot be recruited first.
B: If Rovero was recruited third, the order would be White, Villas, Rovero, Peters, Quinn, Stanton, Tao. This order satisfies all conditions.
C: If Stanton was recruited second, the order would be White, Villas, Rovero, Tao, Peters, Stanton, Quinn. This order does not satisfy the condition that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
D: If Tao was recruited sixth, the order would be White, Villas, Rovero, Peters, Stanton, Tao, Quinn. This order does not satisfy the condition that Tao was recruited immediately after Rovero.
E: If Villas was recruited sixth, the order would be White, Villas, Rovero, Tao, Peters, Quinn, Stanton. This order does not satisfy the condition that Villas was recruited immediately before White.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.

Action: Answer("D")
Reasoning: 
  - Since Peters was recruited fourth, then the order of the recruits is as follows: (1) one of {Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, White} was recruited first; (2) a second person was recruited; (3) a third person was recruited; (4) Peters was recruited; (5) a fifth person was recruited; (6) White was recruited; (7) Rovero was recruited; (8) Tao was recruited.
  - Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, then Villas was recruited in step (5) and White was recruited in step (6).
  - Since White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then White was recruited in step (6), Rovero was recruited in step (7), and Tao was recruited in step (8).
  - Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton must have been recruited in step (1) or (2). But if Stanton was recruited in step (1), then Quinn must have been recruited in step (2), which is impossible because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, Stanton was recruited in step (2).
  - Thus, the possible order of recruits is: (1) Quinn; (2) Stanton; (3) Villas; (4) Peters; (5) one of {Rovero, Tao}; (6) White; (7) one of {Rovero, Tao}.
  - Therefore, Tao could have been recruited sixth. Thus, the answer is D.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are seven accomplices in total, and they were recruited one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then we can deduce the following order: White, Rovero, Tao. Now, we need to determine which answer choice is consistent with this order.
  A: If Quinn was recruited first, then the order would be Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, and Stanton. This doesn't match the order we deduced earlier.
  B: If Rovero was recruited third, then the order would be Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, White, Tao, and Stanton. This matches the order we deduced earlier, so it could be true.
  C: If Stanton was recruited second, then the order would be Quinn, Stanton, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, and Tao. This doesn't match the order we deduced earlier.
  D: If Tao was recruited sixth, then the order would be Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, and Stanton. This matches the order we deduced earlier, so it could be true.
  E: If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order would be Quinn, Peters, White, Rovero, Tao, Villas, and Stanton. This doesn't match the order we deduced earlier.
  
Action: 
Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  White was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, we can deduce that the order of recruitment must be Peters, Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, and finally Tao. 
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then we know that Tao must be recruited last, and Rovero must be recruited fifth. This means that Quinn, Villas, White, and Rovero are recruited in the first four steps. 
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of first four recruitments is Quinn, Villas, White, and Peters. We also know that Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must be recruited third, and White is recruited fourth. 
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  Therefore, Rovero must be recruited fifth, which means that the only option that could be true is that Rovero was recruited third. So the answer is B.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth. 
  2. Stanton was not recruited right before or after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited right before White.
  5. All accomplices were recruited one at a time.
  
Analysis:
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao:
    - Then we have the following order for White, Rovero, and Tao: W-R-T.
    - We know that Peters was recruited fourth, so the order up to Peters is: _ _ _ P _ _ _.
    - Villas was recruited right before White, so Villas must have been recruited fifth: _ _ _ P V W.
    - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited before Rovero, but after Peters: _ Q _ P V W.
    - Also, Stanton was not recruited right before or after Tao. So, the possible order for Tao and Stanton are: 
      - _ Q S P V W T
      - _ Q P V W S T
      - _ Q P V S W T
      - _ Q P V S T W

Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, it is possible that Tao was recruited sixth.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
- Eight books F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O are arranged on three shelves.
- The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.
- At least two books are placed on each shelf.

Working through the given conditions, we can deduce that:
- I must be placed on the middle shelf, so the top shelf contains some combination of F, G, H, and L
- K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top or middle shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
- O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the bottom or middle shelf.
- F is on the same shelf as M, which must be either the top or bottom shelf.

From these deductions, we know that the bottom shelf contains at least 3 books (since the top and middle shelves have a combined max of 5 books), including both F and M. As such, only one of the answer choices has a combination that meets these requirements.

Action: Answer("B") 
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A cannot be true because it only has two books, and the prompt states that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - Choice B is not possible because it has F and M, but the prompt states that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Choice C cannot be true because it has G and K, but the prompt states that K is on a higher shelf than F, and F is not on the bottom shelf.
  - Choice D is possible, as it includes F, G, M, and O. However, we need to check if it violates any of the given conditions. Since F and M must be on the same shelf, and K is not included, this could be a correct answer.
  - Choice E cannot be true because it has L, which is on a higher shelf than O, but L is not on the top shelf.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed in the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: F, M are on the same shelf and only two books are allowed per shelf, so this option is not possible.
  B: H cannot be placed on the same shelf as F and M, so this option is not possible.
  C: K is not on the same shelf as G and H, so this option is not possible.
  D: This option is possible because F and M are on the same shelf, and G and O are on different shelves.
  E: L is not on the same shelf as M, so this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The list of books is F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  There are exactly three shelves, and at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So, option A cannot be correct because it only has two books on the bottom shelf.
  We also know that I is placed on the middle shelf. So, options C, D, and E cannot be correct because they do not have I on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F. So, option B cannot be correct because K and F are on the same shelf.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
- More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. 
- I is placed on the middle shelf. 
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F. 
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L. 
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis: 
- Since more books are on the bottom shelf, we can exclude options A and C since they only have 2 books.
- Option B has F, H, and M. However, it violates the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- Option D has F, G, M, and O. It satisfies all conditions.
- Option E has G, H, L, and M. It violates the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed higher than F.
  - O is placed higher than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - Since there are 8 books, and at least 2 books are on each shelf, there cannot be more than 6 books on the bottom shelf.
  - Since more books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf, the top shelf can have at most 2 books.
  - Since I is on the middle shelf, H cannot be on the same shelf as I.
  - Since K is placed higher than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since O is placed higher than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, they must both be either on the top, middle, or bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - Since F and M are on the same shelf, and F cannot be on the top or bottom shelf, both must be on the middle shelf.
  - Since I is also on the middle shelf, there can only be one more book on the middle shelf, which must be G or H.
  - Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books: K, L, O.
  - The remaining book, which must be on the top shelf, is either G or H.
  - Thus, the only complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf is F, H, and M, which is choice (B).
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Applying the given conditions, we can deduce that:
  - The books on the middle shelf are I, and one of either F or M (since F and M are on the same shelf).
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, therefore K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L, therefore O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and at least two books are placed on each shelf, we can deduce that there are either 3 or 4 books placed on the bottom shelf.
  
Checking the options against these conditions, we find that the only option that meets the given criteria is:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- At least two books are placed on each shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Reasoning:
- We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf, so any answer choice that does not have at least two books on the bottom shelf can be eliminated.
- We know that F and M are on the same shelf, so any answer choice that separates F and M cannot be correct.
- We do not know where L is, but we know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so any answer choice that has L on the bottom shelf cannot be correct.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
- F and M are on the same shelf, so they must be on either the top or middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the same shelf as F and M, which means F and M must be on the top shelf and K must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf, so the remaining books (G, H, and O) must be on the bottom shelf.
- This leaves us with F, H, and M on the top/middle shelf, and G, O, and H on the bottom shelf, which is exactly what answer choice B lists.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Analysis:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf and that more books are placed on the bottom shelf, therefore there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf. Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, we know that F and M must be on the same shelf, which could be the bottom shelf. H and L are not placed on a higher shelf than K and O, respectively, so we can eliminate choices C and E. G is not placed on the same shelf as F or M, so we can eliminate choice D. Therefore, the answer must be A or B. Since there must be at least two books on each shelf, we can eliminate choice A. Therefore, the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M. 

Elimination:
  A: F and M cannot be the only books placed on the bottom shelf.
  B: Possible, but inconsistent with the condition that the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf. 
  C: G, H, and K are not placed on the same shelf as F, which is a contradiction with K being placed on a higher shelf than F.
  D: Possible. F, G, and M can be placed on the same shelf, and O can be placed on a higher shelf than L.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring has no relation to the conditions given in the context.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall has no relation to the conditions given in the context.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall does not have the same effect as the given condition because it does not mention N.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring has the opposite effect of the given condition.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring has no relation to the conditions given in the context.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are six cookbooks, K, L, M, N, O, and P, that will be published in either fall or spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D") 
Substituting the condition that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring has the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks as the original condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  - K and N must be published in the same season.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D") 
Substituting "If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring" for "If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring" would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks because both conditions state that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year.
  - Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  
Action: 
  To have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, we need to find an option that creates a similar condition. The only option that creates a similar condition is Option E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. Therefore, the answer is Answer("E").
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The given conditions for publishing the cookbooks:
    - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
    - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
    - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
    - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  - We need to find the condition that would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks as the given condition.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  - We need to find a condition that would have the same effect as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that if N is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  - Option A talks about L and M, so it is not relevant to the given condition.
  - Option B talks about N and P, so it is not relevant to the given condition.
  - Option C talks about M and P, so it is not relevant to the given condition.
  - Option E talks about O and N, so it is not relevant to the given condition.
  - Therefore, the only option that talks about N and M is option D, which states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This condition is equivalent to the given condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring can be restated as: If N is published in the fall, M must be published in the fall.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring is not equivalent to the given condition.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall is not equivalent to the given condition.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall is not equivalent to the given condition.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring is not equivalent to the given condition.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring is not equivalent to the given condition.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are 6 cookbooks to be published: K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: 
  Choice A does not have the same effect as the original condition because it does not involve M and N.
  Choice B is incorrect because N and P are not related in this way in the original conditions.
  Choice C is incorrect because it only involves M and P, and does not mention N at all.
  Choice D has the same effect as the original condition because it involves M and N in the same way.
  Choice E does not have the same effect as the original condition because it only involves O and N.
  Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year.
  - Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation:
  Among the given choices, option D is the only one that talks about N having a fixed season based on the season of another cookbook. The original statement says that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Option D says that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This is equivalent to the original statement because if N is in spring, and M cannot be in the same season as N, then M must be in the fall. Therefore, option D has the same effect as the original statement.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
The original condition is related to the publication of M and N. It states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This implies that M and N cannot be published in the same season. Option D is the only one that is related to the publication of M and N. It states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This condition has the same effect as the original condition in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are six cookbooks: K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
  
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This condition only affects L and M, and has no effect on N, O, or P. Therefore, A does not have the same effect as the given condition.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This condition does not affect M, and has no effect on whether N is published in the spring or fall. Therefore, B does not have the same effect as the given condition.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This condition does not affect N, and has no effect on whether N is published in the spring or fall. Therefore, C does not have the same effect as the given condition.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This condition is the same as the given condition, but with "spring" and "fall" reversed. Therefore, D has the same effect as the given condition.
  E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This condition only affects O and N, and has no effect on M, K, or P. Therefore, E does not have the same effect as the given condition.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs
  Each of the four walls will have exactly two paintings - one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall can have only one student's work displayed on it.
  No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, this means that none of their paintings can be on wall 1 because wall 1 cannot have both of their paintings. 
  This means that two paintings by the other two students, Hidalgo and Greene, must be on wall 1.
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, Hidalgo's oil painting must be displayed on wall 1.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The exhibition room has 4 walls and each wall will display exactly 2 paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then the combination of paintings by Hidalgo and Greene must be displayed on wall 1.
  A: Franz's watercolor is not necessarily displayed on wall 1.
  B: Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1, because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. 
  C: Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1, because it is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  D: Hidalgo's oil might be displayed on wall 1, but it is not a must.
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor might be displayed on wall 1, but it is not a must.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly 2 paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly 2 paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room - walls 1, 2, 3, and 4 - with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  The question states that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  
Logic: 
  Since Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, we know that neither Isaacs's oil nor watercolor can be displayed on walls 1 or 3 since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, Isaacs's oil must be displayed in the upper position on either wall 1 or 3. And since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position on wall 3. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 1. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are 4 walls, each displaying 2 paintings (one oil and one watercolor).
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene must have one painting displayed on wall 1.
  There are only two paintings left to be displayed by Greene and Hidalgo.
  Those two paintings must be displayed on walls 2 and 4, but it is not known which painting is displayed where.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  We know that Franz's oil is displayed with Greene's watercolor, and that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. 
  Since each wall has exactly two paintings, if Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, we can deduce that Greene and Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 1 and wall 4. 
  We also know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  A: We cannot display Franz's watercolor on wall 1 since it will have only one student's work displayed. 
  B: We cannot display Greene's oil on wall 1 since the Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  C: We know that Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  D: We cannot display Hidalgo's oil on wall 1 since it will have only one student's work displayed.
  E: We cannot display Hidalgo's watercolor on wall 1 since it will have only one student's work displayed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  We need to determine which painting must be displayed on Wall 1 given that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on Wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on Wall 3.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
Action: Answer("D")  
If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of Wall 3. Therefore, Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on Wall 3. According to the first condition, Wall 1 cannot have only watercolors displayed on it. Also, since Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on Wall 2, Wall 1 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. This means that the only possible painting that can be displayed on Wall 1 is Hidalgo's oil. Therefore, the answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Each wall of the exhibition room has two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - Each painting is either an oil or a watercolor.
  - Two paintings by the same student cannot be displayed on the same wall.
  - No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.

Action: Answer("D") 
Since Isaacs's watercolor and oil paintings are already displayed on walls 2 and 4 respectively, and no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, we know that Franz's paintings cannot be on walls 2 or 4. Therefore, Franz's paintings must be on walls 1 and 3. We also know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil must be in the lower position on wall 3. This means that the two paintings left to display on wall 1 are Hidalgo's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor, and since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, we know that Hidalgo's oil must be on wall 1. Therefore, the answer is (D) Hidalgo's oil.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four art students displays two paintings — an oil and a watercolor, so there are a total of 8 paintings.
  - Exactly two paintings are displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: 
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we know that neither of these paintings can be displayed on wall 1. We also know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so we need to have at least one oil painting on wall 1. We can deduce that Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 3 because it would mean that Franz's oil would be displayed in the upper position, which is not allowed. Therefore, the only option left for wall 1 is Hidalgo's watercolor.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Franz's oil painting is displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor.
  Isaacs's oil painting is displayed on the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor painting is displayed on wall 2.
  We know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. 
  Therefore, we can conclude that:
  - The upper position on wall 2 can have either Hidalgo's oil and Greene's watercolor or Hidalgo's watercolor and Greene's oil.
  - Wall 1 can have either Franz's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil or Hidalgo's watercolor and Franz's oil. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- There are four students who will each display an oil painting and a watercolor painting, so there are 8 paintings in total.
- There are four walls, and each of them can display two paintings.
- There are specific rules that govern which paintings can be displayed on each wall:
  - No wall can have only watercolors.
  - No wall can have the works of only one student.
  - Wall 1 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs on it.
  - Greene’s watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz’s oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs’s oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, it means:
- Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4 (according to the rule that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4).
- Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1 (according to the rule that wall 1 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs on it).
- Therefore, Franz's watercolor must be displayed on wall 2 or wall 3.
- Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, it means that Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 2.
- Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 1 and wall 4 (according to the rules that no wall can have only watercolors and no wall can have the works of only one student).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

Since George, Nina, and Robert all give different-day morning reports, we know that George must give his report on Tuesday morning. We also know that Olivia and Robert must give their reports on different days from each other because they can only give morning reports. Lastly, if Nina gives a report, then either Nina's report must be on Wednesday, or Helen and Irving must both give reports on the day after Nina's report.

Reasoning:
  - If Helen gives a report on Wednesday (which is the last day), then Nina's report must be given on Monday. But if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible because George is already giving a report on that day. So this option is not possible.
  
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Olivia and Robert must give their reports on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Then on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports because Nina gave her report on Monday. But this is not possible because George is already giving a report on Tuesday. So this option is not possible.

  - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Olivia and Robert must give their reports on Monday and Wednesday, respectively. Then on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports because Nina gave her report on Tuesday. This option is possible.

  - If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Robert must give a report on Wednesday. Then on Tuesday, George and Nina must both give reports because no one else can give a report on that day. Then on Wednesday, either Helen and Irving must both give reports (if Nina didn't give a report), or no one else can give a report (if Nina gave a report on Wednesday). So this option is possible.

  - If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Olivia must give a report on Monday. Then on Tuesday, George and Nina must both give reports because no one else can give a report on that day. Then on Wednesday, either Helen and Irving must both give reports (if Nina didn't give a report), or no one else can give a report (if Nina gave a report on Wednesday). So this option is possible.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six reports will be given over three consecutive days.
  
Reasoning:
  1. George can only give a report on Tuesday, which means the other two students who give reports with George must be scheduled on Monday and Wednesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, which means they must give the morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Monday or else Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible.
  4. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday and Monday, respectively. This leaves Robert to give a report on Monday and Olivia to give a report on Wednesday.
  5. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports the next day. This means they must give reports on Monday along with Robert and Olivia. George would then give a report on Tuesday and Nina on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. George gives a report on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
  4. Exactly six out of eight students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  5. Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday. [If George gives a report on Tuesday, then it would be impossible for Helen to give a report on Wednesday because all the spots are already taken. This choice is not possible.]
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday. [If Nina gives a report on Monday, then it would be impossible for Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day since Nina has not given her report yet. This choice is not possible.]
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday. [This is possible. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. The remaining students Kyle, Lenore, Olivia, and Robert will give their reports on Monday.]
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday. [This is not possible because Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.]
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday. [This is not possible because Robert cannot give an afternoon report.]
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day: one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports, and they do so on different days from one another:
  - George must give his report on Tuesday (according to the first condition).
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so Robert must give his report in the morning.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give her report on Monday. She must give her report on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday (according to the third condition). However, this would mean that there are three reports on Wednesday (George, Robert, and Nina), which is not possible. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday.
  - This means that on Monday, there are two reports, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The only students who have not given a report yet are Helen, Irving, and Olivia. Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, both Helen and Irving must give their reports on Monday. Therefore, it is possible that Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can only give his report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, therefore they must give their reports in the morning.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  1. George, Nina, and Robert can give their reports only on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  2. George must give his report on Tuesday.
  3. Robert cannot give his report on Tuesday because George is already giving his report.
  4. Nina can give her report on any day except Tuesday because if she gives her report on Tuesday, then on the next day (i.e., Wednesday), Helen and Irving must both give reports.
  5. If Nina gives her report on Monday, then on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports.
  6. If Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then on Monday, Helen and Irving must both give reports.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: 
  If George, Nina, and Robert give their reports on different days from one another, then the only combination that allows for Helen to give her report on Wednesday is if Nina gives her report on Monday, George gives his report on Tuesday, and Robert gives his report on Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 students in total: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  - Exactly 6 students will give individual oral reports during 3 consecutive days, with 2 reports each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they give them on different days from one another, then the only way for Helen and Irving to give reports on consecutive days is if Nina gives her report on Monday or if she gives it on Wednesday together with another student. 

A: It is not possible for Helen to give a report on Wednesday because that would mean she would give a report on consecutive days with either Nina, Robert, or George, which is not allowed.
B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, Helen and Irving can give reports on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively without any issues. This is a possible scenario.
C: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, but this is not possible because George is the only one who can give a report on Tuesday.
D: Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so this is not possible.
E: If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then either George or Nina must give a report on Monday, which means that Helen and Irving cannot give reports on consecutive days. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are eight students in a seminar: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another:
    - George gives his report on Tuesday.
    - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give their reports in the morning.
    - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday. This could be true, as it is not dependent on any of the conditions above.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday. This cannot be true, as George gives his report on Tuesday and Nina cannot give her report on Wednesday since she would be required to give it in the morning and George is already scheduled to give his report that morning.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday. This cannot be true, as George gives his report on Tuesday and Nina cannot give her report on Wednesday since she would be required to give it in the morning and George is already scheduled to give his report that morning.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday. This cannot be true, since Olivia cannot give an afternoon report and both Robert and Nina need to give their reports in the morning in order to honor the conditions.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday. This could be true, as Robert did not give his report on Monday or Tuesday, so he must give his report on Wednesday. Also, he cannot give an afternoon report, so he needs to give his report in the morning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports.
  - Each day has one morning and one afternoon report.
  - George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
 
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday. Not possible, because if George gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday. Not possible, because if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday according to the given condition.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday. This is possible because if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving can give their reports on Wednesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday. Not possible, because neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so there wouldn't be a morning report available for Olivia on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday. Not possible, because Robert cannot give an afternoon report, and there is no morning report available on Wednesday.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The seminar has 8 students, and exactly 6 will give individual oral reports during 3 consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. 
  Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  We need to determine which of the answer choices could be true if George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days from one another.
  
Analysis:
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days from one another, then one of them must give a report on Monday, one on Tuesday, and one on Wednesday. 
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then neither Olivia nor Robert can give a report on Tuesday. So, at least one of them must give a report on Monday or Wednesday. 
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and since no student can give more than one report, neither Olivia nor Robert can give a report on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then there is no restriction on the reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  Now let's check each answer choice:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday. - This could be true if George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Monday, and Robert gives a report on Wednesday. This satisfies all the restrictions.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday. - This could be true if George gives a report on Tuesday and Robert gives a report on Wednesday. In this case, Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday. - This cannot be true because George must give a report on Tuesday, and no student can give more than one report.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday. - This cannot be true because neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, and all the reports on Monday are in the afternoon.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday. - This could be true if George gives a report on Tuesday and Nina gives a report on Monday. In this case, Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - George gives a report only on Tuesday.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—during three consecutive days.
  - George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
  
  A: There is no possibility of Helen giving a report on Wednesday, because if George gives a report on Tuesday, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. But since Nina, George and Robert give reports on different days from one another, Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday. So, on Wednesday the reports must be given by two among the remaining five students.
  
  B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday either George and Helen or George and Irving would be required to give the reports, which is not possible.
  
  C: This could be possible. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then on Monday two of the remaining four students (Helen, Irving, Kyle, and Lenore) can give reports. On Wednesday, George and Robert can give reports.
  
  D: Olivia cannot give a report on Monday as neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  
  E: This is not possible. If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then on Tuesday George must also give a report, which is not possible as George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days from one another.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members.
  - Exactly one of the project members will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected. This is because if Wells is not selected, Ruiz cannot be selected, but if Ruiz cannot be selected, then Quinn cannot be the project leader. Therefore, Wells must be a project member, and by the constraint, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, which leaves the remaining three workers (Smith, Taylor, and Xue) to be the project members. Since Smith and Taylor must be project members together, and exactly three workers are being selected, Xue is the only remaining choice for the third project member. So the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three workers: one leader and two members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then that worker must be the leader.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be a member.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a member.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, the only possible combinations for the three-member project team are:
- Quinn, Smith, and Wells with Quinn as the leader
- Quinn, Smith, and Xue with Quinn as the leader
- Quinn, Taylor, and Wells with Quinn as the leader
- Quinn, Taylor, and Xue with Quinn as the leader
- Ruiz, Smith, and Taylor with Ruiz as the leader
- Ruiz, Smith, and Xue with Ruiz as the leader
- Wells, Smith, and Taylor with Taylor as the leader
- Wells, Smith, and Xue with Taylor as the leader
Since there are exactly three workers, and one must be the leader, the selection for the project is completely determined.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three workers and one project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they lead the project.
  Smith and Taylor are mutually dependent; Smith's selection implies Taylor's selection and vice versa.
  Wells, Ruiz, and Verma are mutually exclusive; Wells' selection implies neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  
Analysis:
  Option A doesn't provide enough information to determine the selection since it doesn't account for Quinn's or Taylor's selection.
  Option B doesn't provide enough information to determine the selection since it doesn't account for Quinn's or Xue's selection.
  Option C doesn't provide enough information to determine the selection since it doesn't account for the project leader and Ruiz's selection.
  Option D doesn't provide enough information to determine the selection since it doesn't account for the project leader and Verma's selection.
  Option E accounts for all the constraints. If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected. If Wells is selected, then Quinn or Taylor must be the project leader. If Quinn is the leader, then Ruiz must be one of the members. Therefore, Taylor and Xue will be the last two members. If Taylor is the leader, then Ruiz must not be selected, and thus, Xue and Quinn will be the members of the project. In either case, the selection is completely determined by selecting neither Ruiz nor Verma.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The project will have 3 members and one of them will be the leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a member, they must be the leader.
  If Smith is a member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected since he is the only remaining candidate. In this case, Ruiz cannot be a member. So, if Quinn is a member, he must be the leader. If Ruiz is a member, he must also be the leader. Since one of these two must be a member, the leader is determined. Therefore, the selection is completely determined. Hence, the answer is E.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Three workers will be selected to be project members, and one of these project members will be the project leader.
- Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
- If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
- If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Action: Answer("E")  
If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, this means Wells must be a project member. Therefore, according to the constraints, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. This leaves only three workers who can be project members: Wells, Smith, and Taylor. Per the constraints, if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be, so there is only one possible combination of project members: Wells, Smith, and Taylor. Since Wells is a project member, he must be the project leader. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members, and one member will be the project leader.
  Constraints:
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Solution:
  We can try to select the project leader first:
  - If Quinn or Ruiz is the project leader, then the other person (if selected) will also be in the project.
  - If Smith is the project leader, then Taylor must also be in the project.
  - If Wells is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be in the project.
  Since exactly one person is the project leader, we can have three cases:
  1. Quinn or Ruiz is the project leader. Then, the third project member must be Smith or Taylor. If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected. Otherwise, Taylor cannot be selected. So, we must have either (Quinn or Ruiz) and (Smith and Taylor). The third person can be any of the remaining four. Therefore, this case allows for multiple solutions.
  2. Smith is the project leader. Then, the other two project members must be Taylor and one of the following: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, or Xue. Therefore, this case allows for multiple solutions.
  3. Wells is the project leader. Then, the other two project members must be two of the following: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, or Xue. However, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Therefore, the only possible solution is to have Wells as the project leader, and the other two members are Quinn and Xue. 
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members, and one of them will be the project leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.

Action: Answer("D") 
If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Quinn will not be a project member. If Quinn is not a member, then Smith will not be a project member (because Taylor cannot be a project member unless Smith is a project member). Thus, we only have three possible project members: Smith and Taylor must be project members, and the third member must be either Verma or Xue. Since Quinn and Ruiz must be project leaders if they are project members, and they are not project members in this scenario, the project leader must be either Smith or Taylor. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined in this case, and the answer is D.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three workers will be selected for the project
  - Exactly one of the three workers will be the project leader
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Let's consider each option one by one:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
     There are still five workers left. The selection is not completely determined.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
     There are still five workers left. The selection is not completely determined.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
     There are still five workers left. The selection is not completely determined.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
     We can start by selecting Wells. Then according to the constraint, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. That leaves us with four workers: Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue. We can then select Smith and Taylor because of the constraint. This leaves us with only Quinn and Ruiz as options for the project leader. Therefore, the selection is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
     We can start by selecting Wells. Then according to the constraint, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. That leaves us with five workers: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue. We can then select Smith and Taylor because of the constraint. This leaves us with only Quinn and Ruiz as options for the project leader. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the seven workers will be selected.
  Exactly one of the selected workers will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be selected if they will be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  This option is the only one that imposes a constraint that eliminates two workers from consideration. If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, but one of the other five is the project leader, then the other two members can be any of the remaining four workers. If any of the other options were true, then there would still be multiple scenarios that would satisfy the constraints.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Let's analyze each option:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
    - If neither Quinn nor Smith are selected, Taylor is not required to be selected, and Wells, Verma, and Xue are also candidates. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
    - If neither Quinn nor Taylor are selected, Smith must be selected. For the third position, there are four candidates (Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue). Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
    - If neither Quinn nor Xue are selected, Smith and Taylor must be selected. Therefore, the third position must be between Ruiz, Verma, and Wells. Since Ruiz and Wells cannot be selected together, Verma must be the third member and leader of the project. Therefore, the selection is completely determined.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
    - If neither Ruiz nor Wells are selected, Quinn and Smith cannot be selected because they must be the leader of the project. Therefore, the only possible members are Taylor, Verma, and Xue. It is not determined who will be the leader of the project.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
    - If neither Ruiz nor Verma are selected, Quinn and Smith cannot be selected because they must be the leader of the project. Therefore, the only possible members are Taylor, Wells, and Xue. It is not determined who will be the leader of the project.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other
  - More sales representatives are working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2

If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone:
  - Udall must work in the same sales zone as well (because Udall and Stuckey work in the same sales zone)
  - There are at most four sales representatives left for Zone 1 and Zone 2 (Kim, Parra, Quinn, Tiao)
  - Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least three sales representatives in Zone 3.
  - Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because if Tiao worked in Zone 1, then both Parra and Udall would be working in Zone 2, which contradicts the condition that only one of them works in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1.
  - Quinn must work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  - Kim can work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.

A: Kim works in Zone 2. - This cannot be true because Kim is one of four sales representatives (Kim, Quinn, Mahr, Tiao) who can work in Zone 2 or Zone 3. Therefore, there is no information suggesting that Kim must work in Zone 2, and it could be either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
B: Mahr works in Zone 1. - This cannot be true because Mahr is not one of the representatives who can work in Zone 1, which are Parra and Tiao.
C: Parra works in Zone 3. - This cannot be true because Parra works in Zone 1, according to the given conditions.
D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. - This cannot be true because both Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, which must be the same as Mahr's sales zone since Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
E: Tiao works in Zone 1. - This is true because Parra works in Zone 1, and either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Since Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 1. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives that work in 3 sales zones. 
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot also work in that sales zone since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. This means Udall is in a different sales zone than Mahr and Stuckey, which gives us the following possible scenarios:
  1) Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall are in Zone 3, and Parra and Tiao are in Zone 1. This means Kim can be in Zone 2 and there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, A, B, and E are all possible.
  2) Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall are in Zone 2, and either Parra or Tiao is in Zone 1. This means the other person is in Zone 3, and there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, C and D are possible.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones, Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  There are seven sales representatives, Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in the same sales zone as both Mahr and Stuckey because "Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other". Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 1 or Zone 3. If Udall works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 ("Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2"). However, this would mean that Parra works in Zone 3, which contradicts "Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1". Therefore, it must be the case that Udall works in Zone 3. Since "There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2" and we already know that Udall and Stuckey work in Zone 3, it must be the case that at least three sales representatives work in Zone 3. This means that Kim cannot work in Zone 2, so (A) is false. Since Udall works in Zone 3 and either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, it must be the case that Parra works in Zone 3 (if Tiao works in Zone 1) or Tiao works in Zone 3 (if Parra works in Zone 1). Therefore, (C) and (E) could be true. We already know that Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, so (B) could be true. Finally, since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, it could be the case that Stuckey works in Zone 3, so (D) could also be true.
Action: Answer("B", "C", "D", or "E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
  
Analysis: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that zone because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn and Parra both have to work in Zone 1. That would mean that Tiao, who cannot work in Zone 1, would have to work in Zone 2 along with Udall, which would mean that there are two people working in Zone 2, a contradiction, so Parra does not work in Zone 1. Similarly, Tiao cannot work in Zone 2 either because Udall already works there, so Tiao must work in Zone 3. That means there are more people working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so Zone 3 must have at least three people working in it. If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then that zone cannot be Zone 3 because there are already at least three people working in that zone. Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey must both work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are seven sales representatives and three sales zones.
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone:
- Udall must work in the same sales zone as well (because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone).
- That sales zone cannot be Zone 1 (because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, so there would be at least three sales representatives in Zone 1).
- That sales zone could be either Zone 2 or Zone 3.

A: Kim works in Zone 2. 
- This is possible, but not necessary. 
- Eliminate.

B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
- This is not possible because Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, and that sales zone cannot be Zone 1.
- Eliminate.

C: Parra works in Zone 3.
- This is possible, but not necessary. 
- Keep.

D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
- This is possible, but not necessary.
- Keep.

E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
- This is not possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Parra could be working in that zone.
- Eliminate.

Action: Answer("CD")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that zone, according to the condition that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - This means that either Tiao or Parra works in Zone 1, and the other works in Zone 3.
  - However, we know that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so we can eliminate choices A and B.
  - The fact that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone means that both of them are in either Zone 1 or Zone 3. Since one of them must be in Zone 3, Parra must be in Zone 3, so we can eliminate choice C.
  - This leaves us with choices D and E. If Stuckey works in Zone 2, then Udall must also work in Zone 2, which contradicts the condition that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, the only possible option is that Tiao works in Zone 1, which means that Parra works in Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  One of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both.
  One of Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then they cannot both work in Zone 2 because Stuckey cannot work in both the same zone as Udall and the same zone as Mahr.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, they may work in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If they work in Zone 1, then Parra or Tiao (but not both) must also work in Zone 1, but there are no other constraints on Zone 1, so any of the other sales representatives could be in Zone 1, including Kim and Tiao.
  If they work in Zone 3, then more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means at least three sales representatives work in Zone 3. If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, then neither Parra nor Udall can work in Zone 3, which means that Zone 3 would have at most two sales representatives. Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao works in Zone 1, and neither Tiao nor Udall works in Zone 2. That means that both Parra and Udall work in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, so Stuckey must also be in Zone 3. That means that only one of Kim, Mahr, and Quinn can be in Zone 3, which leaves the other two sales representatives to be in Zone 1, including Mahr.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are exactly seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are exactly three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, we can conclude that:
  - Mahr and Stuckey are not in Zone 1, because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Mahr and Stuckey are not in Zone 2, because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Also, if Stuckey and Udall are in the same sales zone, then Mahr cannot be in the same zone as Stuckey and Udall because it would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey are in Zone 3 and the remaining sales representatives are split between Zones 1 and 2.
  
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. This could be true, as we don't have any information about where Kim is working.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1. This cannot be true, because Mahr and Stuckey are both in Zone 3.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. This could be true, as Parra could be in the same sales zone as Quinn and possibly Udall.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. This cannot be true, because we already concluded that Stuckey and Mahr are both in Zone 3.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1. This could be true, as Tiao could be in the same sales zone as Parra and Quinn.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone:
  - Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Udall cannot work in Zone 2, because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so if Stuckey and Mahr work in the same sales zone, they will be in a different sales zone to Parra.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so either Stuckey or Mahr must be working in Zone 3.
  
Solution:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. - Not necessarily true.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1. - Not possible, given that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. - Not necessarily true.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. - Not possible, given that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1. - Not possible, given that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs exactly 7 sales representatives to work in its 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, it means that Mahr cannot work in Zone 3, since there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Also, since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone as each other, then neither Parra nor Mahr can work in Zone 3.

Eliminating choices:
  A: It is not possible for Kim to work in Zone 2 since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 1, because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3, because neither Parra nor Mahr can work in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey can work in Zone 2.

Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are seven businesses—optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  The pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at opposite ends.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  Since the pharmacy must be at one of the ends, we only need to consider two cases: pharmacy at space 1 or pharmacy at space 7.
  If the pharmacy is at space 1, then the restaurant must be at space 7. The optometrist and veterinarian can be in spaces 2 and 3 in any order. The two restaurants can be in spaces 4 and 6 in any order, and the shoe store and toy store can be in spaces 5 and 7 in any order. Therefore, we have two options:
    - pharmacy, optometrist/veterinarian, optometrist/veterinarian, restaurant, toy store, shoe store, restaurant
    - pharmacy, veterinarian/optometrist, optometrist/veterinarian, restaurant, shoe store, toy store, restaurant
  If the pharmacy is at space 7, then the restaurant must be at space 1. The optometrist and veterinarian can be in spaces 5 and 6 in any order. The two restaurants can be in spaces 2 and 4 in any order, and the shoe store and toy store can be in spaces 3 and 7 in any order. Therefore, we have two options:
    - restaurant, toy store, shoe store, restaurant, optometrist/veterinarian, optometrist/veterinarian, pharmacy
    - restaurant, optometrist/veterinarian, toy store, restaurant, optometrist/veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy

  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Eliminating the options one by one:
  Option A: The pharmacy is at one end of the row, which is correct. However, it does not meet the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. So, this option is incorrect.
  Option B: The pharmacy is at one end of the row, which is correct. The two restaurants are separated by one business, which is incorrect. The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, which is incorrect. The toy store is not next to the veterinarian, which is correct. So, this option is incorrect.
  Option C: One of the restaurants is at one end of the row, which is incorrect. The two restaurants are separated by one business, which is incorrect. The pharmacy is not next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, which is incorrect. The toy store is not next to the veterinarian, which is correct. So, this option is incorrect.
  Option D: One of the restaurants is at one end of the row, which is correct. The two restaurants are separated by at least two businesses, which is correct. The pharmacy is not next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, which is incorrect. The toy store is next to the veterinarian, which is incorrect. So, this option is incorrect.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Seven chapters in total, 1 through 7.
  - Seven different clues to be mentioned exactly once: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters between them.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Otherwise, the constraint "U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters" would be violated. X cannot be adjacent to either W or S, but T must be adjacent to W. Therefore, the order of the first three chapters must be one of the following: TXU, TUX, WTU, or WUT. Thus, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in either chapter 3 or 4.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, and X cannot be adjacent to either W or S. This means that the order of the first four chapters must be either TUXR or TXUR. Thus, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 in this scenario.
 
B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then U must be mentioned in chapter 5, and X must be adjacent to U. This means that the order of the first five chapters must be either TUXRW or TXURW. If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, and S must be mentioned in chapter 2. However, the constraint "S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters" would be violated in this scenario.

C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, and X cannot be adjacent to either W or S. This means that the order of the first four chapters must be either TUXS or TXUS. Thus, S can be mentioned in chapter 2 in this scenario.

D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, and X cannot be adjacent to either W or S. This means that the order of the first four chapters must be either TUXW or TXUW. If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, and R must be mentioned in chapter 7. However, the constraint "S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters" would be violated in this scenario.

E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then U must be mentioned in chapter 5, and X must be adjacent to U. This means that the order of the first five chapters must be either TUXWZ or TXUWZ. If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2, and R must be mentioned in chapter 7. However, the constraint "S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters" would be violated in this scenario.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We are given seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  There are seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: We know X is mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, we can deduce:
- U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
- W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 since X and W cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
- If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and R and S will be mentioned in chapters 3 and 5 in some order. In this scenario, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, so E is not possible.
- If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and R and S will be mentioned in chapters 2 and 4 in some order. In this scenario, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, so B and C are not possible.
- If T is mentioned in chapter 4 or later, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, so W must be mentioned in chapter 4, and R and S will be mentioned in chapters 3 and 5 in some order. In this scenario, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so A is not possible.
Based on the above, the only possible choice is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. Therefore, the answer is: Answer("D").
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are seven clues - R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each chapter mentions exactly one clue.
  Constraints on the order of clues:
   - T cannot be in chapter 1.
   - T must be before W and there are exactly two chapters between T and W.
   - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
   - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
   - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then the clue in chapter 2 cannot be U because U and X must be in adjacent chapters. This eliminates choices C, D, and E. 

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then the clue in chapter 2 cannot be W because W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters. This eliminates choice A. 

That leaves choice B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. This could be true because there is no constraint that prohibits R from being in chapter 7 and all other clues have already been placed. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z will appear exactly once, one per chapter, in a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, with two chapters between them.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2 because U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. From the rules, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 so it has to be mentioned in chapter 2. Also, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 5 (since there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W). S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, thus they cannot be in chapters 1 and 2, so they must be in chapters 3 and 4 in some order. R is left to be placed in chapters 6 and 7.

Solution:
  Based on the analysis, the only possible valid option is D because W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The novel consists of seven chapters numbered from 1 to 7.
  Seven clues are mentioned exactly once, one in each chapter: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Constraints:
    T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
    T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from W.
    S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1:
    - U must be in chapter 2.
    - W must be in chapter 4.
    - T must be in chapter 6.
    - R, S, and Z are the clues that remain to be assigned chapters 3, 5, and 7.
    - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
    
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, U should be in chapter 2, and W should be in chapter 4. This would mean that T must be in chapter 6. Thus, R, S, and Z are the clues that remain to be assigned chapters 3, 5, and 7. S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters. Therefore, it is impossible for R to be mentioned in chapter 3 if X is mentioned in chapter 1 because S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. Likewise, it is impossible for Z to be mentioned in chapter 3 because S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. Z also cannot be in chapter 5 because it would be adjacent to W. Therefore, the only possible answer is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a possible order of the clues with the given constraints.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Then, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 and T must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  The remaining clues R, S, and Z can be placed in any of the remaining three chapters 3, 5, and 7, provided that the constraints are satisfied.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so at least one of them must be in chapter 3 or 7 and the other in chapter 5.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W must be in chapter 4 and X must be in chapter 1 or 3. 
  Thus, the only possible order of clues with X in chapter 1 is: X, U, R/Z, S/Z, W, T, and the remaining clue in the last chapter.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are seven clues in seven chapters of a mystery novel.
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating T from W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. The possible options are:
  Chapter 1: X, Chapter 2: U
  Chapter 1: X, Chapter 3: U
  Chapter 1: X, Chapter 4: U
  Chapter 1: X, Chapter 5: U
  Chapter 1: X, Chapter 6: U
  Chapter 1: X, Chapter 7: U

Option A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, which is not possible.
Option B: If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5 and W must be in chapter 7, which is possible.
Option C: If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 1, which is not possible.
Option D: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and R must be mentioned in chapter 7, which is possible.
Option E: If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, which is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The novel consists of 7 chapters.
  There are 7 clues - R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z - which must be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  There are several constraints regarding the order in which clues are mentioned:
    - T cannot be in chapter 1.
    - T must be mentioned before W with exactly 2 chapters separating the two.
    - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1: 
    - U must be in chapter 2.
    - W cannot be in chapter 2 (because W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters).
    - Therefore, W must be in chapter 5.
    - T cannot be in chapter 1 or chapter 2 (because T must be mentioned before W with exactly 2 chapters separating the two).
    - Therefore, T must be in chapter 3.
    - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, so neither one can be in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
    - Therefore, R must be in chapter 2 and Z must be in chapter 4.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then R must be in chapter 2, T must be in chapter 3, U must be in chapter 2, W must be in chapter 5, Z must be in chapter 4, and S cannot be in chapter 2 or chapter 3. Therefore, R could be mentioned in chapter 7, which is the best answer.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The mystery novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. 
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis: 
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2 due to the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. This also means that S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Since chapter 3 is the first available chapter after chapter 2 and T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, T must be mentioned in chapter 3. This also means that R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 due to the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Since R has to be mentioned in one of the remaining chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7, we can eliminate choice A and choose choice B or D. Since Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4, we can eliminate choice E and choose choice B. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Seven different clues, R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z, are mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
- T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2, and as W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5.

Analysis:
- If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Thus, Choice C is not possible because it mentions S as chapter 2.
- If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, and T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Thus, Choice A is not possible because it mentions R as chapter 3.
- If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, and T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Thus, Choice E is not possible because it mentions Z as chapter 3.
- If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, and T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Thus, Choice B is not possible because it mentions R as chapter 7.
- If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, and T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Choice D satisfies all the constraints and is possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs are to appear in three sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) of tomorrow's newspaper.
  - Two photographs per section.
  - Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: 
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, so both photographs in the other two sections must be taken by Fuentes and Hue. Therefore, the only option that could be true is B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section must have exactly two from the available six photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: 
  Suppose both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Gagnon. Then each of the other two sections must have at least one photograph from either Fuentes or Hue. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, both photographs in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and/or Hue. This means that the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be equal to the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, option A and E cannot be true. Since one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, option C cannot be true. Option B could be true if the other photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue. Thus, the answer is Answer("B").
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each of the three sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) must have two photographs, with no repeats.
  For each photographer, there must be at least one, but no more than three, of their photos.
  There must be at least one photographer who appears in both the Lifestyle and Metro sections.
  The number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photos in Sports.
  Gagnon cannot have any photos in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then there can be no Gagnon photos in the Sports section. Therefore, we know that:
    - In the Lifestyle section, there must be either one or two photos not by Gagnon.
    - In the Metro section, there must be at least one photo not by Gagnon.
    - In the Sports section, there must be exactly one photo not by Gagnon.
    
  A: There can be no Gagnon photos in the Lifestyle section, so this is not possible.
  B: One photo in the Lifestyle section must be by Gagnon, so this is not possible.
  C: There can be no Fuentes photos in the Metro section, so this is not possible.
  D: This is possible. It satisfies all the conditions in the problem.
  E: Hue must have at least one photo in the Sports section, so this is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
- If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then we cannot have Gagnon's photographs in the Sports section. 

Analysis:
- If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have both photographs in the Sports section.
- Therefore, there must be at least one photograph by either Fuentes or Hue in the Sports section.
- Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, if one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue, then one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
- If one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes, then one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, thus we cannot have both photographs in the Lifestyle section taken by Hue.
- Therefore, the only possible option is B: one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are a total of six different photographs, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then:
    - There will be at most one Gagnon's photograph in each of the other two sections.
    - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
    - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
    - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
    
Analysis:
  - In the Lifestyle section, there could be at most one Gagnon's photograph, and at least one photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. So, Options A and B are not possible.
  - In the Metro section, there could be at most one Gagnon's photograph. So, Option C is not possible.
  - In the Sports section, there can be at most one Gagnon's photograph. If there is one Gagnon's photograph, then there can be at most one Fuentes photograph and at most one Hue photograph. If there are no Gagnon's photographs, then there can be at most two Fuentes photographs and at most two Hue photographs. So, Option E is not possible.
  - The only possible option is D.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in Lifestyle must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then let's consider each option:
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
    This is not possible because in this case, there would be no photograph by Gagnon in Lifestyle section.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
    This is possible because there could be two Gagnon's photographs in another section.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
    This is not possible because there must be at least one photograph in Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro section. But if both photographs in Metro are by Fuentes, then there would be no photograph in Metro section by Hue or Gagnon.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
    This is possible because there could be two Gagnon's photographs in another section.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
    This is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports. If both photographs in Sports section are by Hue, then there would be two Hue's photographs in Sports section but no Hue's photograph in Lifestyle section.
    
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- 6 photos will be selected; 2 per section in 3 sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
- Each photographer can have 1-3 of their photos selected.
- At least one photo in Lifestyle must be by a photographer who has at least one photo in Metro section.
- Hue's photos in Lifestyle = Fuentes' photos in Sports.
- Gagnon cannot have photos in Sports section.

Action: 
- If both photos in one of the sections (let's say Lifestyle) are by Gagnon, then:
- Gagnon cannot have photos in Sports section, so Gagnon has no photos left for Sports section.
- Fuentes must have at least one photo in Lifestyle section (because there must be a photographer who has photos in both Lifestyle and Metro).
- Since Hue's photos in Lifestyle = Fuentes' photos in Sports, and Gagnon has no photos left for Sports, then Hue and Fuentes must each have 1 photo in Lifestyle and 1 photo in Metro.
- Therefore, One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
- The other options are not possible given the constraints.
- Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Six photos in total, two photos in each of the three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: 
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then the section cannot be the Sports section since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, the only two sections that are left available are the Lifestyle section and the Metro section. Since it is impossible for both photographs in the Lifestyle section to be by Gagnon, then at least one of the photographs in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that either Fuentes or Hue must have a photograph in the Lifestyle section, and either Fuentes or Gagnon must have a photograph in the Metro section. From the given options, the only one that satisfies these conditions is (D): One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) must have exactly two photographs from the three photographers.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("E")
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the sections are by Gagnon, they cannot be in the Sports section, according to the given conditions. Therefore, they must be in either the Lifestyle or Metro section. This leaves only two possible combinations: (Gagnon, Fuentes) and (Gagnon, Hue). If (Gagnon, Fuentes) are in the Lifestyle section, then the Metro section must have at least one Hue photograph. However, this would mean that there are more Fuentes photographs in the Metro and Sports sections than Hue photographs in the Lifestyle and Sports sections, which violates the given condition. Therefore, (Gagnon, Fuentes) cannot be in the Lifestyle section. This leaves (Gagnon, Hue) in the Lifestyle section. The only way to satisfy the condition that at least one Lifestyle photograph is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section is to have a Fuentes photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, (Fuentes, Hue) must be in the Sports section, which means that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Hence, the answer is E.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then the only possible section where Gagnon's photographs can be is the Metro section, since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, Gagnon has at most one photograph in the Metro section.
If Gagnon has at most one photograph in the Metro section, then there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, according to the condition.
If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section would be 2, which violates the condition that for each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Sports section would be 2, which violates the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  3. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  4. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - From (1), the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  - From (2), if the harmonica is before the lamp, then the mirror has to be before the lamp as well. Therefore, the lamp cannot be on June 2nd because the mirror can only go before it.
  - From (3), the sundial has to be before the mirror and vase, so it cannot be on June 6th. Also, the vase cannot be on June 2nd because of (2).
  - From (4), the table has to be before the harmonica or the vase, so it cannot be on June 6th. Moreover, since the harmonica cannot be on June 2nd because of (2), the table cannot be on June 1st.

Action: Answer("D") - The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are six antiques to be auctioned: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
  The auction will take place over six consecutive days: June 1st through June 6th.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If harmonica < lamp, then mirror < lamp.
  If sundial < mirror, then sundial < vase.
  If table < harmonica, then table < vase.
  
Analysis:
  A: The harmonica and sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, so the mirror cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp can be auctioned on June 2nd and satisfies all the conditions, so this is possible.
  C: The vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the sundial must be auctioned before it.
  D: The lamp can be auctioned on June 3rd and satisfies all the conditions, so this is possible.
  E: The mirror cannot be auctioned on June 5th because the lamp must be auctioned after it.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are six antiques to be auctioned: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
  - There are six auction days: June 1st - June 6th.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica must be auctioned after the lamp if the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
- Choice A: It is not possible for the mirror to be auctioned on June 2nd since the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror.
- Choice B: It is not possible for the lamp to be auctioned on June 2nd since the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp if the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
- Choice C: It is not possible for the vase to be auctioned on June 2nd since the sundial must be auctioned before the vase.
- Choice D: The lamp could be auctioned on June 3rd, after the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, and before the mirror is auctioned on June 4th.
- Choice E: It is not possible for the mirror to be auctioned on June 5th since the lamp must be auctioned before the mirror.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Six antiques (harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase) are auctioned on six consecutive days.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - Harmonica, Lamp, and Mirror have a possible relationship in terms of their auction dates.
  - The sundial is auctioned before both the mirror and the vase.
  - Table is auctioned before harmonica or vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd (because the mirror should be auctioned earlier than the lamp according to the condition). Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, but this contradicts the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, A is not true.
  - If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before June 2nd and the mirror must also be auctioned before June 2nd. According to the condition, the sundial should be auctioned earlier than the mirror, so the sundial should be auctioned before June 2nd. This means that the vase and the table should be auctioned on June 3rd or later. However, according to the condition, the table should be auctioned earlier than the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  - If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned before then. According to the condition, the sundial is auctioned earlier than both the vase and the mirror, which means the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the harmonica, lamp, and mirror should be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, and June 5th (not necessarily in this order). The table cannot be auctioned on June 6th because it should be auctioned before either the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  - If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica and the mirror should also be auctioned on June 3rd or earlier. However, the sundial should be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, and the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, D is not true.
  - If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp should also be auctioned on June 5th or earlier. According to the condition, the sundial should be auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase, so the sundial should be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the table should be auctioned on June 2nd or earlier, and the vase should be auctioned on June 4th or later. This means that the harmonica and the lamp should be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. Therefore, E could be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 antiques: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase
  - There are 6 days of auctions: June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, and June 6th
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st
  - If harmonica < lamp, then mirror < lamp
  - sundial < mirror and sundial < vase
  - table < harmonica OR table < vase

Analysis:
- Choice A is possible if the table is auctioned on June 1st, the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, the sundial is auctioned on June 4th, the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, and the vase is auctioned on June 6th.
- Choice B is not possible because the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd if the mirror is auctioned on a day after the harmonica.
- Choice C is not possible because the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd if the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
- Choice D is not possible because the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 3rd if the mirror is auctioned on a day after the harmonica.
- Choice E is possible if the sundial is auctioned on June 1st, the table is auctioned on June 2nd, the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, the lamp is auctioned on June 4th, the vase is auctioned on June 5th, and the mirror is auctioned on June 6th.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  There are six antiques to be auctioned over six consecutive days.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that: 
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. 
     In order for the mirror to be auctioned on June 2nd, the harmonica and table must also be auctioned earlier. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st, which contradicts the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
     This choice is possible. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st. If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the vase and sundial will be auctioned on June 4th and June 5th, respectively. This leaves the lamp to be auctioned on June 2nd.

  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
     This choice is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.

  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
     This choice is not possible because the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd as it has to be auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.

  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
     This choice is possible. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st. If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the vase and sundial will be auctioned on June 4th and June 5th, respectively. This leaves the lamp to be auctioned on June 2nd.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - From the first condition, we know that the sundial can be auctioned on June 2nd to June 6th.
  - From the third condition, we know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, so the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  - From the fourth condition, we know that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  - From the second condition, we know that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp as well.
  - If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror and the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which is impossible due to the first condition. So, C is not true.
  - If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. However, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 3rd if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, because it would violate the third condition. So, B is not true.
  - If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. The sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, because it cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd without violating the third condition. The vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later, because it cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, and it cannot be auctioned on June 3rd without violating the third condition. So, D could be true.
  - If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. The sundial must be auctioned on June 4th or later, because it cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, and it cannot be auctioned on June 3rd without violating the third condition. The vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, because it cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th without violating the third condition. So, A could be true.
  - If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the vase must be auctioned on June 6th, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th. The harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd. This arrangement satisfies all the conditions. So, E could be true.

Action: Answer("A") or Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- Six antiques will be auctioned, one per day for six consecutive days (June 1st through June 6th).
- The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
- The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
- The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. -> If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st and the lamp on June 3rd due to the condition that if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. However, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because it is stated that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. This choice violates the conditions.
B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. -> If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must either be auctioned on June 1st or June 3rd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror also must be auctioned on June 1st, which means that the sundial must be auctioned on June 4th, and the vase and the table must be auctioned on June 5th and June 6th, respectively. However, the table cannot be auctioned on June 5th because it is stated that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd, the mirror on June 4th, the sundial on June 1st, the vase on June 6th, and the table on June 5th. This choice violates none of the conditions.
C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. -> If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must either be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, which means the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. However, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, and the table cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because it violates the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, this choice violates the conditions.
D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. -> If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, the mirror on June 2nd, the sundial on June 4th, and the vase on June 6th. The table can be auctioned on June 5th. This choice violates none of the conditions.
E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. -> If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, the lamp on June 3rd, and the sundial on June 2nd. However, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because it violates the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, this choice violates the conditions.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not before both.
  
Process of elimination:
- Choice A: It is not possible because if the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on either June 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th, violating the condition that the lamp must be auctioned after the harmonica.
- Choice B: It is not possible because the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp, as stated in the second condition.
- Choice C: It is not possible because the vase must be auctioned after the mirror, as stated in the third condition.
- Choice D: It is possible. If the table is auctioned on June 1st, the sundial on June 2nd, the mirror on June 3rd, the harmonica on June 4th, the vase on June 5th, and the lamp on June 6th, then all conditions will be satisfied.
- Choice E: It is not possible because the mirror cannot be auctioned on June 5th since the lamp must be auctioned after the harmonica.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 6 antiques that will be auctioned: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
  - There are 6 auction days: June 1st to June 6th.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica will be auctioned on a later date than the lamp, if the mirror is also auctioned on a later date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - Choice A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp and harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd or later since the harmonica must be auctioned on a later date than the lamp. The sundial, table, and vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 4th, and June 5th. However, this contradicts the fact that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  - Choice B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd since the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial, table, and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, and June 5th. This satisfies all the conditions, so this could be true.
  - Choice C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later since the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. The sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th since the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp and the sundial. This cannot be true since the vase must be auctioned on a later date than the sundial and the mirror.
  - Choice D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
    - If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd since the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial, table, and vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, and June 6th. This satisfies all the conditions, so this could be true.
  - Choice E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
    - If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp and harmonica must be auctioned on June 6th since the harmonica must be auctioned on a later date than the lamp. The sundial, table, and vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, and June 4th. However, this contradicts the fact that the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Trades must be one of the following:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
    - Each building is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3.
      
A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
   This cannot be true because Lynch and Meyer Building are class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp, and Ortiz Building is a class 2 building also owned by Trustcorp. 
B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
   This can be true. Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2). If they trade Lynch Building (class 2) for Garza Tower (class 1) owned by RealProp, Southco would own Garza Tower and Meyer Building (class 2) in this scenario.
C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
   This cannot be true because King Building and Ortiz Building are both class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp.
D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
   This can be true. Trustcorp owns King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2 buildings. If they trade Flores Tower (class 1) owned by Southco for Yates House (class 3) owned by RealProp, Trustcorp would own Flores Tower and Yates House in this scenario.
E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
   This cannot be true because Garza Tower is a class 1 building owned by RealProp and Lynch Building is a class 2 building owned by Southco.
   
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). 
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. 
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Each company has at most one building of each class.
  
Analysis:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp cannot be the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building because Trustcorp owns those buildings. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco cannot be the Meyer Building because Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco cannot be the King Building because Trustcorp owns the King Building. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp can be the Flores Tower and the Yates House, so D can be true.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp cannot be the Garza Tower because RealProp owns the Garza Tower, and they cannot be the Lynch Building because Southco owns the Lynch Building. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Each company has buildings of different classes.
- The trades must be one of the following:
  - Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
  - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
- A cannot be true because the buildings owned by RealProp are not the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
- B cannot be true because Southco does not own the Meyer Building.
- C cannot be true because Southco does not own the King Building and Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.
- D can be true, as it is possible for RealProp to trade Yates House (class 3) for Trustcorp's Flores Tower (class 1).
- E cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own Garza Tower and Southco does not own Lynch Building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
- Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
- Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
- The trades can only occur among buildings of the same class or according to the three given rules.

A: The buildings owned by RealProp are all class 3, whereas the buildings owned by Trustcorp are all class 2, so this cannot be true.
B: This could be true. The Garza Tower is of class 1 and is owned by either Southco or RealProp, and the Meyer Building is of class 2 and is owned by Trustcorp.
C: This cannot be true. If Southco owned three buildings, one of which was the King Building, then it would have to own both the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building as well. But both of those are class 2, so this violates the trading rule that one class 2 building can only be traded for two class 3 buildings.
D: This could be true. The Yates House is of class 3 and is owned by RealProp, and the Flores Tower is of class 1 and is owned by either Southco or RealProp. Trustcorp could own any other combination of buildings.
E: This cannot be true. If Trustcorp owned the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, then it would have to own the Meyer Building as well, but that is class 2, so it would violate the trading rule that one class 1 building can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to identify an option that is not possible even after making any combination of valid trades.
  
Analysis:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are all class 1 or class 3, whereas Trustcorp owns only class-2 buildings. So, this option is not possible.
  B: Southco owns only one class-1 building, but the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp. So, this option is not possible.
  C: Meyer Building and Ortiz Building are owned by Trustcorp, which are both class 2 buildings. But Southco only owns two buildings, one of class 1 and one of class 2. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  D: Yates House is owned by RealProp, which is a class 3 building. But Trustcorp only owns class 2 buildings, and Flores Tower is already owned by Southco. So, this option is not possible.
  E: Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and Flores Tower is owned by Southco. Trustcorp only owns class-2 buildings. Therefore, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Trades can be made between buildings of the same class, between 1 class 1 building and 2 class 2 buildings, or between 1 class 2 building and 2 class 3 buildings.  
Analysis:
  A: RealProp owns only 1 class 1 building, but the other buildings are owned by Trustcorp and Southco.
  B: Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Meyer Building (class 2), so this trade could be possible.
  C: Southco does not own King Building, and Trustcorp does not own Garza Tower, so this combination is not possible.
  D: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, and the Yates House is owned by RealProp, so this combination is not possible.
  E: Trustcorp owns King Building and Meyer Building, while Southco owns Flores Tower and Lynch Building. So, Garza Tower which is owned by RealProp cannot be owned by Trustcorp.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  A: RealProp owns only one class 1 building, so this cannot be true.
  B: Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building, so this cannot be true.
  C: Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower, so this cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp does not own the Yates House, so this can be true.
  E: Southco does not own the Yates House, and Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower, so this cannot be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  There are three types of trades: (1) trading one building for one other building of the same class, (2) trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, and (3) trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  The options present combinations of buildings that cannot be true.
  
Analysis: 
  A: This cannot be true, because RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  B: This is possible. Southco owns Garza Tower (class 1) and Meyer Building (class 2).
  C: This cannot be true, because Southco only owns two buildings whereas it is stated that Trustcorp owns three buildings.
  D: This cannot be true, because Trustcorp does not own Yates House (class 3).
  E: This cannot be true, because Trustcorp does not own Garza Tower (class 1) and Southco does not own Lynch Building (class 2).

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns a class 1, class 3, and another class 3 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Trades can only occur between buildings of the same class or as specified in the three trade options.
  
  A: Trustcorp does not own any of the buildings owned by RealProp, so this cannot be true.
  B: Southco does not own the Meyer Building, so this cannot be true.
  C: Southco does not own the King Building, so this cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp does not own the Yates House, so this cannot be true.
  E: Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower, and Southco does not own the Lynch Building, so this cannot be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Trades can only be made between buildings of the same class or with specific trade conditions.
  
Analysis:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are all class 1 or class 3, so they cannot be the class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  B: This trade would require exchanging a class 1 building for a class 2 building, which is not a valid trade.
  C: This trade would require exchanging a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, which is a valid trade.
  D: This would require Trustcorp to own the Yates House (class 3), which is owned by RealProp.
  E: This would require Trustcorp to own the Garza Tower (class 1), which is owned by RealProp.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The manager of the photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies, one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  The following constraints apply:
  - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  - No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  - If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  We need to find the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony from the given choices. 
  According to the constraints, Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. So, either Frost and Heideck go to Silva or Thorne. 
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Since we're looking for the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva ceremony. 
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. So, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne ceremony.  
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. So, either Lai goes to Silva and Mays goes to Thorne or Lai goes to Thorne and Mays goes to Silva.
  Based on these constraints, we can only form one possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The photography business manager must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies-one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Solution:
  There are two ceremonies, Silva University and Thorne University. Thus, there must be two groups of at least two photographers each assigned to the ceremonies. 
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. So, option A is not possible because it only assigns one of Frost or Heideck to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. So, option C is not possible because it does not assign Lai to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Thus, option E is not possible because it only assigns Mays to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. Thus, option D is not possible because it only assigns Lai and Heideck to the Silva University ceremony.
  Therefore, the only possible option is B which assigns Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck to the Silva University ceremony, and Knutson, Lai, and Mays to the Thorne University ceremony.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Elimination:
  A: Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony, and at least two photographers have to be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony but not all. So, this is not a valid assignment.
  B: This could be a valid assignment as it satisfies the constraints.
  C: Gonzalez and Knutson are assigned to the same ceremony, but the constraint requires at least two photographers to be assigned to each ceremony. So, this is not a valid assignment.
  D: This is not a valid assignment as Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony.
  E: This is not a valid assignment as Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The manager of the photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available, but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Solution:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so Frost and Heideck cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Gonzalez can only be assigned to the Silva University ceremony under the condition that Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Knutson can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony or the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson - This assignment would not be possible because both Frost and Heideck would be assigned to the same ceremony.
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck - This assignment would not be possible because there must be at least two photographers assigned to each ceremony.
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson - This assignment would not be possible because there must be at least two photographers assigned to each ceremony.
  D: Heideck, Lai - This assignment would not be possible because Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony when Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  E: Knutson, Mays - This could be a possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony. Lai would have to be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Heideck would have to be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony since Knutson is not assigned to it.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The manager of the photography business must assign at least two photographers to each ceremony.
  The following constraints apply:
    - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the ceremonies.
    - If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
    - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
    - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

A: Frost cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony alone, and Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which means Heideck and Mays have to be assigned to it. Therefore, this option is not valid.
B: According to this option, Frost and Heideck are assigned to one ceremony. However, no other photographers are assigned to this ceremony, which means this option is not valid.
C: According to this option, neither Frost nor Heideck is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which contradicts one of the given constraints. Therefore, this option is not valid.
D: According to this option, Heideck is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which means Frost must be assigned to the same ceremony. However, Lai is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which contradicts one of the given constraints. Therefore, this option is not valid.
E: According to this option, Knutson is assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which means both Heideck and Mays must also be assigned to the same ceremony. Additionally, Lai is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which satisfies the constraint that Gonzalez must be assigned to the same ceremony as Lai. Therefore, this option is valid.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply:
- Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
- If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
- If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
- If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so they cannot be assigned to Silva University alone. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, so at most one of them can be assigned to Silva University. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. So, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, otherwise, Lai would have to be assigned to Thorne University, but we know that at most one of Lai or Mays can be assigned to Thorne University. Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. So, the only possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck. Thus, the correct answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies, one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University.
  Exactly six photographers are available, but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, they must be assigned to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  In order to assign photographers to the Silva University ceremony, we need to make sure that the following rules are applied:
  - No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson - violates the rule that no photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck - satisfies all the rules. This could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson - violates the rule that at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.
  D: Heideck, Lai - violates the rule that if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  E: Knutson, Mays - violates the rule that at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. 
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. 
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  To find out which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony, we need to check which options satisfy all given constraints.
  Option A: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, and Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. This leaves only one photographer, Gonzalez, to be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which does not satisfy the constraint that at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony. Option A is not valid.
  Option B: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, and Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. This leaves only one photographer, Gonzalez, to be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which does not satisfy the constraint that at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony. Option B is not valid.
  Option C: If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Since option C does not assign Heideck or Mays to the Thorne University ceremony, it is not valid.
  Option D: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, and Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. This leaves two photographers, Lai and Gonzalez, to be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Since it is not given that Lai and Gonzalez are assigned to the same ceremony, it is possible that both are assigned to the Silva ceremony. Option D is valid.
  Option E: If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Since option E does not assign Heideck or Mays to the Thorne University ceremony, it is not valid.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  - Exactly six photographers are available - Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays - but not all have to be assigned.
  - No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  - If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Elimination:
  - Choices C, D, and E cannot be the complete assignment for Silva University ceremony because they have only one photographer assigned to the ceremony.
  - Choice A cannot be the complete assignment for the Silva University ceremony because Knutson is not assigned to it, and the question states that if Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  - Choice B satisfies all the constraints and could be the complete assignment for the Silva University ceremony.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The manager of the photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available - Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays, but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Analysis:
  In order to answer this question, we need to check which of the answer choices could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony while still meeting all the constraints mentioned in the context.

Action: Answer("B")  
  Explanation: 
    Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If we assign Frost and Heideck to the Silva University ceremony, then we still need at least one more photographer to be assigned to this ceremony.
    If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. So, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
    If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. So, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
    If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. So, we can assign Lai and Mays to different ceremonies.
    Now, we have the following possible assignments for the Silva University ceremony: 
      Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, and Knutson or
      Frost, Heideck, and Knutson.
    Since we need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony, the first option is valid while the second option is not valid. Therefore, the answer is B.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Tao was recruited second, the possible order of recruitment is: (1) [unknown], (2) Tao, (3) [unknown], (4) Peters, (5) [unknown], (6) [unknown], (7) White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so he cannot be the one recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, the one immediately before or after Tao must be one of the unknowns.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be the one immediately after Tao. Therefore, Quinn must be one of the unknowns.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas and White must be recruited last and second to last, in some order.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton must be one of the remaining unknowns, and he cannot be the one recruited immediately after Tao.

Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the analysis above, the order of recruitment could be: (1) Quinn, (2) Tao, (3) Stanton, (4) Peters, (5) Rovero, (6) Villas, (7) White. Therefore, Rovero was recruited fifth, which is option B.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. All seven accomplices were recruited one at a time.
  
If Tao was recruited second, there are only two possibilities for the order of recruitment: 

1- Peters, Tao, ...., ...., ...., .....
2- ...., Tao, Peters, ...., ...., .....

We can determine the following from the given information:
- Stanton cannot be immediately before or after Tao.
- Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
- Peters was recruited fourth.

A: If Quinn was recruited third then the order would be Peters, Tao, Quinn, ...., ...., ...., ..... This is possible, so A could be true.
B: If Rovero was recruited fifth then the order would be ...., Tao, Peters, Quinn, Villas, Rovero, White. However, Rovero must have been recruited later than Quinn, so B cannot be true.
C: If Stanton was recruited sixth then the order would be ...., Tao, Peters, Quinn, Villas, Stanton, White. However, Stanton cannot be immediately before or after Tao, so C cannot be true.
D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order would be ...., Tao, Peters, Quinn, ...., Villas, White. This is possible, so D could be true.
E: If White was recruited third, then the order would be Peters, Tao, White, ...., ...., ...., ..... This is not possible because Villas must be recruited immediately before White. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Peters was recruited fourth.
  5. Seven accomplices were recruited one at a time.
  
If Tao was recruited second, the order of the accomplices would be: [X, Tao, X, X, X, X, X]

Based on the given information, we can establish the following:
- Peters was recruited fourth, so the order would be [X, Tao, X, Peters, X, X, X].
- Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, Villas would be recruited either in the first or second position. If Villas was recruited first, then the order of the accomplices would be [Villas, White, Tao, Peters, X, X, X]. This would mean that Rovero cannot be recruited in the fifth position as Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. So, Option B is not possible. 
- If Villas was recruited second, then the order of the accomplices would be [X, Villas, White, Tao, Peters, X, X]. This leaves the positions sixth and seventh for Stanton and Rovero. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao so he cannot be recruited in the sixth position. Therefore, Option C is not possible. 
- This leaves us with Option A, D, and E. As we have no information about the order of Quinn, Villas, White, Stanton, and Rovero, either one of them could be in the third position. Therefore, we can conclude that Option A, D, and E are possible.
Action: Answer("ADE")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.

Action: Answer("A")
Explanation: 
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order in which accomplices were recruited is:
  1) Tao
  2) [UNKNOWN]
  3) [UNKNOWN]
  4) Peters
  5) [UNKNOWN]
  6) [UNKNOWN]
  7) [UNKNOWN]
  
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be recruited either in spot 3 or 4. But Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn must be recruited in spot 3. So, A is true.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White. So, if Villas was recruited in slot 6, then White would have to be recruited in slot 7, which is not possible. So, D cannot be true.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. So, if Tao was recruited 2nd, then Stanton cannot be recruited in slot 6. So, C cannot be true.
  Similarly, White cannot be recruited in slot 3 because Villas is already recruited in slot 2 and Villas was recruited immediately before White. So, E cannot be true.
  This leaves B as a possibility, but we cannot confirm it as there is not enough information available to determine if Rovero was recruited fifth.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  3. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  4. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  5. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
If Tao was recruited second, the possible order of recruitment is:
  1. Peters
  2. Tao
  3. Quinn
  4. Villas
  5. White
  6. Rovero
  7. Stanton

A: Quinn was recruited third is possible according to the order.
B: Rovero was recruited fifth is not possible because Rovero must be recruited immediately after Quinn.
C: Stanton was recruited sixth is not possible because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
D: Villas was recruited sixth is not possible because Villas was recruited fourth.
E: White was recruited third is not possible according to the order.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Peters was recruited fourth.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Analysis:
If Tao was recruited second, Peters must have been recruited first, and there must have been at least two people recruited after Tao. Therefore, Quinn was either third or fourth to be recruited, and Rovero was either fifth or sixth. Also, Villas must have been recruited before White, and Stanton was either recruited before Tao or after the other four.

A: If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero must be recruited sixth, which contradicts Quinn being recruited earlier than Rovero.
B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Quinn must be recruited third, which satisfies all the given conditions.
C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Tao must be recruited fifth, which contradicts Stanton not being recruited immediately before or after Tao.
D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then White must be recruited seventh, which contradicts Villas being recruited immediately before White.
E: If White was recruited third, then Villas must be recruited second, which contradicts Peters being recruited fourth.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment could be: 
1. ???
2. Tao
3. ???
4. Peters
5. Quinn
6. Rovero
7. Villas
8. White
From the given options:
  A: If Quinn was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be: ??, Tao, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, White, but this violates the fact that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. So, this option cannot be true.
  B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be: ??, Tao, ??, Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White. This order satisfies all the given conditions. So, this option could be true.
  C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be: ??, Tao, ??, Peters, Quinn, Villas, Stanton, White, but this violates the fact that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. So, this option cannot be true.
  D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be: ??, Tao, ??, Peters, Quinn, White, Villas, Stanton, but this violates the fact that Villas was recruited immediately before White. So, this option cannot be true.
  E: If White was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be: ??, Tao, White, Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, Stanton, but this violates the fact that Villas was recruited immediately before White. So, this option cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second, so Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
Analysis:
  - Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited fourth. This means that two people were recruited between Tao and Peters.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. This means that Quinn was either the first or the second person recruited.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White. This means that either Villas was the sixth person recruited and White the seventh, or Villas was the fifth person recruited and White the sixth.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao. This means that Stanton was either the first person recruited or one of the last three people recruited.
  
Action: 
  - If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn was either the first or the second person recruited.
  - Since Peters was recruited fourth, then Rovero cannot be the fifth person recruited because there can only be two people between Tao and Peters.
  - If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then either Villas was the fifth person and White the sixth, or Villas was the sixth person and White the seventh.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao. Therefore, Stanton was either the first person recruited or one of the last three people recruited.
  - The only option that satisfies all of the constraints is option D, Villas was recruited sixth. Therefore, the answer is D. Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The order of the accomplices recruited is: Peters, ?, Tao, Stanton, ?, Villas, White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the accomplices recruited is: Peters, Tao, ?, Stanton, ?, Villas, White.
  
Analysis:
  Since Peters was recruited fourth, then the order of the accomplices recruited is: ?, ?, Peters, Tao, ?, Villas, White.
  Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, then the order of the accomplices recruited is: ?, ?, Peters, Tao, ?, Villas, White.
  Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, then Rovero must have been recruited after Quinn.
  Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, then Stanton must have been recruited either first, third, fifth, or seventh.
  Therefore, the possible orders of the accomplices recruited are:
    1. Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Tao, Stanton, Villas, White.
    2. Rovero, Quinn, Peters, Tao, Stanton, Villas, White.
    3. Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Tao, Stanton, Villas, White.
    4. Quinn, Peters, Tao, Rovero, Stanton, Villas, White.
    5. Quinn, Peters, Tao, Stanton, Rovero, Villas, White.
    6. Quinn, Peters, Tao, Stanton, Villas, Rovero, White.
    7. Quinn, Peters, Tao, Stanton, Villas, White, Rovero.
  Therefore, we can conclude that:
    A: If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn could have been recruited third. (Possible order 1)
    B: If Tao was recruited second, then Rovero could not have been recruited fifth. (Rovero must have been recruited after Quinn)
    C: If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton could have been recruited sixth. (Possible order 5)
    D: If Tao was recruited second, then Villas could not have been recruited sixth. (Villas must have been recruited before White)
    E: If Tao was recruited second, then White could not have been recruited third. (White must have been recruited last)
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- There are seven accomplices recruited one at a time.
- Peters was recruited fourth.
- Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White.
- Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.

If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be: (1) someone, (2) Tao, (3) someone, (4) Peters, (5) someone, (6) someone, (7) Villas, (8) White. 

Now let's go through the answer choices:
A: If Quinn was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be (1) someone, (2) Tao, (3) Quinn, (4) Peters, (5) someone, (6) someone, (7) Villas, (8) White. This is a possible order of recruitment, so A could be true.
B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be (1) someone, (2) Tao, (3) someone, (4) Peters, (5) Rovero, (6) someone, (7) Villas, (8) White. This is not a possible order of recruitment, because Villas must be immediately before White, so B cannot be true.
C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be (1) someone, (2) Tao, (3) someone, (4) Peters, (5) someone, (6) Stanton, (7) Villas, (8) White. This is not a possible order of recruitment, because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so C cannot be true.
D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be (1) someone, (2) Tao, (3) someone, (4) Peters, (5) someone, (6) Villas, (7) Stanton, (8) White. This is not a possible order of recruitment, because Villas must be immediately before White, so D cannot be true.
E: If White was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be (1) someone, (2) Tao, (3) White, (4) Peters, (5) someone, (6) someone, (7) Villas, (8) someone. This is not a possible order of recruitment, because Villas must be immediately before White, so E cannot be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("D")
Reasoning: 
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Solide's voicemail target must be 1 day as well.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
  - Since Solide's website target is 1 day and none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, then Image's website target must also be 1 day. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 2 days. 
  - Thus, Solide's website target is 2 days is not true, and Solide's website target is 1 day is true. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest has a website target and a voicemail target, but we don't know what they are.
  None of the clients' website targets can be longer than their voicemail targets.
  Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
To determine the answer, we can use a process of elimination:
- Choice A is not necessarily true, as we don't know what Image's voicemail target is.
- Choice B is not necessarily true, as we don't know what Image's website target is.
- Choice C is not necessarily true, as we don't know what Image's website target is.
- Choice D is not necessarily true, as we don't know what Truvest's website target is.
- Choice E must be true, because if Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must be 1 day, which is the shortest possible target.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest. 
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. 
  Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest has a website target of 1 day or 2 days, and a voicemail target of 3 days. 

Analysis:
  If we assume that Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which is not possible. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days. This means that Solide's website target must be shorter than 2 days, which leaves us with two options: Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days. 

  Now we need to check Image's voicemail target. Since Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days, and Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, then Image's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days. 
  
  If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's website target cannot be longer than 2 days, which means that Image's website target is either 1 day or 2 days. If Image's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target cannot be shorter than Truvest's website target, which is a contradiction to the conditions. Therefore, Image's website target must be 1 day in this case.

  If Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then Solide's website target can be either 1 day or 2 days. If Solide's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days, which is already stated in the question. If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day, which is also already stated in the question.

Conclusion:
  In all possible scenarios, the only statement that must be true is that Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest has two service targets, one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, we can make the following inferences:
    * Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
    * Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
    * Solide's website target must be 1 day since it is shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days.
    * Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 1 day. This also means that Image's website target can be at most 1 day, as it cannot be longer than Image's voicemail target.
    
Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, if Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Image's website target is 1 day.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two targets are set for each client: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 or 3 days. 

If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must also be 1 day because Solide's website target has to be shorter than Truvest's website target.  This means that Solide's voicemail target must be 2 or 3 days. 

If Solide's voicemail target is 2 or 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. This means that the only option for Image's voicemail target is 1 day. 

If Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then Image's website target must be 2 days because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, the answer is B: Image's website target is 2 days.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The targets can be set as follows: 
  - Image: Website target <= Voicemail target
  - Image: Voicemail target < (Solide and Truvest) Voicemail target
  - Solide: Website target < Truvest: Website target
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it implies that Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target.

Analysis:
- Since Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be either 1-day or 2-day.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must be 1-day, and Truvest's website target must be 2-day.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than other clients' voicemail targets. Since Truvest's voicemail target is already a minimum of 3-day, Image's voicemail target cannot be 1-day or 2-day. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 3-day.
- Since Image's voicemail target is 3-day, and Image: Website target <= Voicemail target, Image's website target must be 3-day.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has a website target and a voicemail target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target:
  - Truvest's website target is 1 day and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is 1 day.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Image's website target and Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
The problem describes a maintenance company that sets targets for its average service response times for three clients (Image, Solide, and Truvest). Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 

A: We don't have enough information to determine Image's voicemail target.
B: We don't have enough information to determine Image's website target.
C: Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and we don't know Truvest's voicemail target, we cannot determine Image's website target.
D: We know that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, but we don't know whether Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target. Therefore, we cannot determine Solide's website target.
E: We know that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target. Therefore, we can conclude that Solide's website target is 1 day.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is set to 1 day and Truvest's voicemail target is set to 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is set to 1 day. Also, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is set to 1 day. Therefore, the only option that is possible is:
Action: Answer("C") Image's website target is 1 day.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Truvest is a client of the maintenance company.
  Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target can only be 1 day. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, which means Image's website target must also be 1 day. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 2 days. Thus, the correct answer is E: Solide's website target is 1 day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - 7 articles will be edited.
  - Three articles cover finance (G, H, J).
  - Three articles cover nutrition (Q, R, S).
  - One article covers wildlife (Y).
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Y is fourth in order. This means that Q must be third. If Q is third, then S must be earlier than Q. We know that S must be earlier than Y, so S must be either first or second. If S is first, then R must be fifth and G must be sixth. This means that J must be seventh. If S is second, then R must be fourth and G must be fifth. This means that J must be sixth.

Action: Answer("B")  
Since J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, J must be third.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 3 finance articles (G, H, J), 3 nutrition articles (Q, R, S), and 1 wildlife article (Y).
  2. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  3. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  4. S must be earlier than Y.
  5. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
If Y is fourth, then S must be first, Q third, and R fifth. J must be earlier than G, so J must be second, and G must be third. That leaves H to be sixth, and Y to be seventh. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Articles G, H, and J cover finance.
  2. Articles Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  3. Article Y covers wildlife.
  4. No two consecutive articles can cover the same topic.
  5. If S is before Q, then Q must be third.
  6. S must be before Y.
  7. J must be before G, and G must be before R.

If Y is fourth, the only possible order for the first four articles is "QSRY" or "QSRG". 

If the first four articles are "QSRY", the order of the remaining three articles is "HJG". 
If the first four articles are "QSRG", the order of the remaining three articles is "HJY". 

A: J cannot be second in either case.
B: J can be third in both cases.
C: Q cannot be first in either case.
D: Q must be third in the case where the first four articles are "QSRY", but it cannot be third in the case where the first four articles are "QSRG".
E: R can only be seventh in the case where the first four articles are "QSRG".

Therefore, the answer is B: J is third.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles needs to meet the following conditions:
  1. Consecutive articles must not cover the same topic.
  2. If S appears before Q, then Q must be third.
  3. S must appear before Y.
  4. J must be before G which must be before R.
  
Solution:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be S, G and R (in any order), since S must appear before Y and the articles cannot be consecutive articles that cover the same topic. From the above mentioned points, we also know that Q must be third article and J cannot be the second article. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that J is third.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The articles are divided into two groups: finance (G, H, J) and nutrition (Q, R, S), plus one article on wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be S, G, H, in some order. The order of the last three articles must be J, R, Q, in that order. 
  
  A: J cannot be second because H would have to be first, which would mean G is second, which violates the rule that J must be earlier than G. 
  B: J must be first in the second group and thus cannot be third.
  C: Q cannot be first because that would mean that S is either second or third, but that would violate the rule that S must be earlier than Y. 
  D: Q must be third because that is the only position where S can be earlier than Q.
  E: R is seventh because it must be last in the second group.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  - Three other articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  - One article covers wildlife: Y.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the following must be true:
    - The first three articles cannot be the nutrition articles because S must be earlier than Y.
    - The first three articles cannot be the finance articles because G must be later than J.
    - Therefore, the first three articles must be Q, R, and Y, in that order. 
    - After Y, the next article can only be one of the finance articles (G, H, or J), in that order because G must be later than J.
    - Finally, the last article must be one of the remaining finance articles (H or J) followed by the wildlife article (Y). 
  
  The only option that follows these conditions is D: Q is third.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  * G, H, J cover finance.
  * Q, R, S cover nutrition.
  * Y covers wildlife.
  * Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  * S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third.
  * S must be earlier than Y.
  * J must be earlier than G and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, the order of the articles must be one of the following:
  1. Q, R, S, Y, G, H, J
  2. R, Q, S, Y, G, H, J
  3. S, Q, R, Y, G, H, J
  
  A: J cannot be second since J must be earlier than G.
  B: J cannot be third since Y is fourth.
  C: Q cannot be first since S must be earlier than Q.
  D: Q cannot be third since S must be earlier than Q.
  E: R cannot be seventh since J must be earlier than G and G must be earlier than R.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  We know the following:
  - Articles G, H, and J cover finance.
  - Articles Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  - Article Y covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  - Y is fourth.
  
  From the given information, we can deduce that Q is third. Therefore, S must be earlier than Q. Since S cannot be fourth (because Y is fourth), S must be second. This means that R cannot be second, so it must be sixth or seventh. Also, since J must be earlier than G, J cannot be fifth or later, so it must be either first, second or third. This means that G must be either second or third. 
  
  So, the possible order of the articles is:
  1. Q
  2. S
  3. G (or J)
  4. Y
  5. (J or G)
  6. H
  7. R
  
  From this, we can conclude that J must be third. Therefore, the answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - G, H, and J cover finance.
  - Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  - Y covers wildlife.
  - No consecutive articles can cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
To determine the answer, we need to use the given conditions to eliminate choices that are not possible and find the one that must be true based on the given conditions.

If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles must be one of the following:

1- S _ _ Y _ _ _
2- Q _ _ Y _ _ _
3- R _ _ Y _ _ _

Option A: J is second.
It is not possible for J to be second because S or Q must be earlier than J, and both S and Q cannot be second because no consecutive articles can cover the same topic.

Option B: J is third.
If J is third, then G must be first and H must be second. Then, the remaining articles are Q, R, S, and Y. Since Y cannot be fifth, it must be fourth. This means that the order must be G, H, J, Q, Y, S, R, which satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, this option must be true.

Option C: Q is first.
It is not possible for Q to be first because S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third.

Option D: Q is third.
If Q is third, then the first two articles must be any combination of G, H, and J, and the fourth article must be S. This is not possible because S must be earlier than Y, which cannot be fifth. Therefore, this option is not possible.

Option E: R is seventh.
If R is seventh, then the order of the first six articles must be one of the following:
- S Q Y _ _ R
- Q S Y _ _ R
- Q Y S _ _ R
- S Y Q _ _ R
- Y S Q _ _ R
- Y Q S _ _ R

In all of these cases, G, H, and J cannot be inserted without violating the given conditions. Therefore, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The articles are divided into two groups: finance (G, H, J) and nutrition (Q, R, S) and one article on wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  If S is before Q, then Q must be third.
  S must be before Y.
  J before G and G before R.

To determine what must be true if `Y` is fourth, we can use the following reasoning:
- If `Y` is fourth, then `S` must be either first, second, or third. It cannot be fourth, as `Y` must be after `S`.
- If `S` is first, then `Q` must be third. It cannot be second, as consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. In this case, `G` and `J` must be second and fourth, but we don't know which one comes first, so we cannot determine if `J` is second or third.
- If `S` is second, then `Q` must be first, as consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. In this case, `G` and `J` must be third and fourth, but we don't know which one comes first, so we cannot determine if `J` is second or third.
- If `S` is third, then `Q` can be either first or third. If `Q` is first, then `G` and `J` must be second and fourth, but we don't know which one comes first, so we cannot determine if `J` is second or third. If `Q` is third, then `G` and `J` must be first and second, but we don't know which one comes first, so we cannot determine if `J` is second or third.

Thus, we cannot determine which one of the statements must be true if `Y` is fourth.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?
Choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
  C: the western, the horror film
  D: the western, the mystery
  E: the western, the sci-fi film
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If the mystery is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., the horror film and the romance cannot be shown on screen 1 or screen 2 at 7 P.M., so one of them must be shown on screen 3. But the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it cannot be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M. if the mystery is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. Therefore, the list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 that cannot be accurate is B, because it includes both the mystery and the sci-fi film on screen 1.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
- Screen 1 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and another at 9 P.M.
- The western begins before the horror movie.
- The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
- The romance is not shown on screen 2.
- The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
- The movie that starts at 7 P.M. on Screen 1 cannot be the romance (because it is not shown on Screen 2) or the sci-fi (because it is not shown on Screen 3).
- The horror film and mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be on Screen 1.
- The western must be shown on either Screen 1 or Screen 2, as it begins before the horror movie.
- Therefore, Screen 1 will show the western and either the horror movie or the mystery. Screen 2 will show the other of those two movies, plus one other movie (either the romance or the sci-fi film).
- The list of movies scheduled to be shown on Screen 1 (with the 7 P.M. movie first) must therefore be one of the following:
  * the western, the horror film
  * the western, the mystery

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are five movies that are playing at the repertory theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  2. The theater has three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  3. Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  4. Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  5. The western begins before the horror film.
  6. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  7. The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  8. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Approach:
  Let's determine which lists of movies can be shown on Screen 1, following the given conditions.

Solution:
  We know that Screen 1 shows two movies each, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M. 
  By condition 8, the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, they cannot be shown together on Screen 1.
  By condition 6, the sci-fi film is not shown on Screen 3. Therefore, the sci-fi film can be shown on either Screen 1 or 2. 
  By condition 7, the romance is not shown on Screen 2. Therefore, the romance can be shown on either Screen 1 or 3.
  By condition 5, the western begins before the horror film does. Therefore, the western must be shown at 7 P.M. 
  Now, we can determine which lists are possible:
    - The sci-fi film, the horror film cannot be shown on Screen 1 together because we need to show a western movie at 7 P.M.
    - The sci-fi film, the mystery can be shown on Screen 1. (Option B)
    - The western, the horror film can be shown on Screen 1. (Option C)
    - The western, the mystery can be shown on Screen 1. (Option D)
    - The western, the sci-fi film can be shown on Screen 1. (Option E)
  Therefore, the only list that cannot be an accurate list of movies scheduled to be shown on Screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first is A: the sci-fi film, the horror film.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.

Let's consider each option:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
     According to the conditions, the horror film cannot be shown with the mystery film on the same screen. Therefore, the horror film must be shown with the western on screen 1. Option A is possible.
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
     The horror and mystery films cannot be shown on the same screen, so the mystery film must be on screen 2. The romance is not shown on screen 2, but the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, so it must be on screen 1. Therefore, option B is possible.
  C: the western, the horror film
     According to the conditions, this is a possible option since the western must be shown before the horror film.
  D: the western, the mystery
     The mystery film must be on screen 2, and the romance is not shown on screen 2. Therefore, the western must be on screen 1. Therefore, option D is possible.
  E: the western, the sci-fi film
     The western film must be shown before the horror film. However, the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3. Therefore, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies showing at the repertory theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  Each movie is shown once on one of the three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  We can eliminate options A, B, C, and D because they all satisfy the given conditions. 
  Option E is possible since the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. followed by the sci-fi movie at 9 P.M.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot be shown together on screen 1. Therefore, option B cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are exactly 5 movies, and each movie is shown once.
  Screens 1 and 2 show 2 movies each, with one movie starting at 7 P.M. and the other starting at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, starting at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis: 
  We need to examine each answer choice to determine if it is possible or impossible given the conditions.
  A: The sci-fi film is shown on screen 1, which is not possible because screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, and the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  B: The sci-fi film is shown on screen 1, which is not possible because screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, and the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  C: The western is shown on screen 1, which is possible because the western begins before the horror film.
  D: The western is shown on screen 1, which is possible because the western begins before the horror film.
  E: The western is shown on screen 1, which is possible because the western begins before the horror film, but the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1 because screens 1 and 2 show two movies each.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  
Analysis: 
  Since screen 1 shows two movies at 7 P.M., the list of movies for screen 1 cannot include the movie that is shown on screen 3. Hence, the movie that is shown on screen 3 will not be in the list. 
  According to the given conditions, the horror film should not be shown on the same screen as the mystery film. The western should start before the horror film. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. 

Action: Answer("B") 
  For option B, the sci-fi film and the mystery film are shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. 
  However, according to the conditions, the horror film and the mystery film cannot be shown on the same screen. 
  Therefore, B cannot be an accurate list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Two movies are shown on screens 1 and 2: one at 7 PM and one at 9 PM.
- One movie is shown on screen 3 at 8 PM.
- The western movie is shown before the horror movie.
- The sci-fi movie is not shown on screen 3.
- The mystery movie is not shown on the same screen as the horror movie.
- The romance movie is not shown on screen 2.

A: The sci-fi movie is shown on screen 1, which means the horror movie cannot be shown on the same screen since the horror and mystery must be on different screens. This combination is possible. 
B: The sci-fi movie is shown on screen 1, which means the mystery movie must be shown on a different screen, which cannot be screen 3. This combination is possible.
C: The western movie is shown on screen 1, but the horror movie must be shown after the western movie. Hence, this combination is not possible. 
D: The western movie is shown on screen 1, and the mystery movie is shown on a different screen, which means this combination is possible.
E: The western movie is shown on screen 1, but the sci-fi movie must be shown on a different screen. Hence, this combination is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Screen 1 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
- The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
- The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
- The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
- The romance is not shown on screen 2.

A: the sci-fi film, the horror film -> This is possible because the western can be shown at 9 PM on screen 1.
B: the sci-fi film, the mystery -> This is possible because the horror film and the mystery must be on different screens, and the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
C: the western, the horror film -> This is possible because the western can be shown at 7 PM on screen 1, and the horror film can be shown on another screen either at 7 PM or 9 PM.
D: the western, the mystery -> This is possible because the western can be shown at 7 PM on screen 1, and the mystery on another screen either at 7 PM or 9 PM.
E: the western, the sci-fi film -> This is possible because the western can be shown at 7 PM on screen 1, and the sci-fi film can be shown on another screen at 9 PM.

Action: Answer("None of the Above") 
None of the options can be ruled out as an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Seven sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall) are working in the three sales zones (Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3).
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: If Kim works in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1. But we know that only one of them can work in Zone 1. Therefore, it's impossible for Kim and Stuckey to both work in Zone 1.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs seven sales representatives.
  The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The company employs 7 sales representatives to work in 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Eliminating some options:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1: There are only two sales representatives that could work in Zone 1, and neither of them are Kim or Stuckey.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3: This is possible.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3: This is possible.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3: This is possible.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1: This is not possible because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are exactly 7 sales representatives and 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To determine which statements are false we can use the process of elimination.

Eliminate A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is possible since we do not have any restrictions on Kim's sales zone. 

Eliminate B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 

Eliminate C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 

Eliminate D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 

Action: Answer("E") 
Therefore, the only statement left is E, which must be false, since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives - Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  They work in three sales zones - Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

A: Kim and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 1, as only one of Parra or Tiao can work in Zone 1 and neither Parra nor Tiao are the same as Kim or Stuckey. Therefore, A must be false.
B: Kim and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 3, as then there would be at most 5 sales representatives left to work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, but there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, B must be false.
C: Mahr and Stuckey both working in Zone 3 is possible. For example, if Parra and Quinn work in Zone 2 and Tiao and Udall work in Zone 1, then Mahr, Stuckey, and Kim work in Zone 3. Therefore, C could be true.
D: Mahr and Udall both working in Zone 3 is possible. For example, if Tiao works in Zone 1, Parra and Quinn work in Zone 2, and Stuckey, Udall, and Kim work in Zone 3, then Mahr works in Zone 3 as well. Therefore, D could be true.
E: Parra and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 1, as only one of Parra or Tiao can work in Zone 1 and neither Parra nor Tiao is the same as Stuckey. Therefore, E must be false.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  If we try to place the sales representatives in the sales zones based on the given conditions, we can eliminate the choices that cannot be true:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. => Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. => Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. => Parra and Quinn must work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. => Stuckey and Udall must work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. => There must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate the choices:
  - A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (Not possible because at most one of Parra and Tiao can work in Zone 1 and we have not placed Stuckey yet.)
  - B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (Not possible because Stuckey must work in the same sales zone as Udall and Udall cannot work in Zone 3.)
  - C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (Possible, we have not placed Mahr yet.)
  - D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. (Possible, we have not placed Mahr and Udall yet.)
  - E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (Not possible because at most one of Parra and Tiao can work in Zone 1 and we have not placed Parra yet.)
  
  Therefore, the answer is either C or D, but we cannot determine which one must be false. Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs exactly 7 sales representatives.
  There are 3 sales zones, Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there are exactly 7 sales representatives, so 3 sales representatives are working in Zone 3. 
  Also, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and there are only 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, it follows that both Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, while Tiao works in Zone 2.
  
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. - This is false because Kim is not mentioned in any of the conditions.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. - This is false because Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall, and we know that there are only 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. - This is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and neither Mahr nor Stuckey are listed in any of the previous conditions.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. - This is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. - This is true because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other and this sales zone is Zone 1. Also, Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall which is Zone 1. 

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The company employs seven sales representatives to work in its three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 3, which contradicts the last condition. Thus, choice A must be false. 
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least two representatives in Zone 3. This is not a contradiction. Thus, choice B might be true.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least two representatives in Zone 3. This is not a contradiction. Thus, choice C might be true.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least three representatives in Zone 3 which contradicts the last condition. Thus, choice D must be false.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 2, which is not a contradiction. Thus, choice E might be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are seven sales representatives and there are more working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3. Therefore, at most, there are four sales representatives working in Zone 1 and Zone 2 combined.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so they either both work in Zone 1 or both work in Zone 2.
  - Tiao and Udall work in different zones, so they cannot both work in Zone 1 or both work in Zone 2.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, but they cannot work in Zone 2 together since Tiao or Udall but not both work in Zone 2.
  - Therefore, Stuckey and Udall both work in Zone 1 or both work in Zone 3.
 
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, at most only two sales representatives work in Zone 3, which contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, this statement must be false.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
A: Kim and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 1 because only one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
B: Kim and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so at least one of Kim and Stuckey must work in Zone 2.
C: Mahr and Stuckey can both work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and nothing precludes them from working in the same zone.
D: Mahr and Udall cannot both work in Zone 3 because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and if Mahr were in Zone 3, there would be more representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3.
E: Parra and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 1 because only one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Exactly three breeds of kitten are featured.
- Exactly three breeds of puppy are featured.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: It is impossible for four breeds to be each featured on three days because there are only seven days and three breeds of each animal.
B: Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
C: This is possible. If Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6 then Greyhounds are also featured on those days.
D: This is not possible. Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans.
E: This is not possible. Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7).
  - Three breeds of kitten are featured: Himalayan, Manx, Siamese.
  - Three breeds of puppy are featured: Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: It's impossible to have exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days. There are only 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies, so the total number of breeds is 6. Moreover, Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, so no other breed can be featured on 3 days.
B: Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. This choice makes it impossible for Greyhounds to be featured on every day that Himalayans are.
C: This choice also makes it impossible for Himalayans to be featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
D: This could be true. Since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, Himalayans can be featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
E: This could be true. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers could be featured on every day that Himalayans are not.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Over seven consecutive days, each of three breeds of kitten (Himalayan, Manx, Siamese) and three breeds of puppy (Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler) are featured exactly once each day.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
A: If there are exactly four breeds each featured on three days, then there are a total of 12 days (4 breeds x 3 days each) which violates the condition that only seven days are used.
B: This is not possible because Greyhounds are only featured on day 1, and Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
C: This is not possible because Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
D: This is possible. If Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6, and Rottweilers are not featured on days 2, 4, or 6, then Himalayans would be featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
E: This is not possible because Rottweilers are featured on day 7, which violates the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on day 7.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- There are exactly seven consecutive days, and three breeds of kitten and three breeds of puppy.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Since there are three breeds of kittens and three breeds of puppies and each breed can't be featured on two consecutive days, each breed must be featured on exactly two or three days.
- Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, other breeds must be featured on two days.
- If Himalayans are not featured on day 1, then they must be featured on days 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, no other breed can be featured on days 2, 3, and 4.
- Rottweilers are not featured on the day Himalayans are featured, so Rottweilers must be featured on days 5, 6, and one other day.
- Since no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, the remaining two breeds must alternate.

Answer:
From the above analysis, we can conclude that none of the options is true based on the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is "None of the above".
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Seven consecutive days are numbered 1 through 7.
  - Three breeds of kitten: Himalayan, Manx, Siamese.
  - Three breeds of puppy: Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
  - We know that Greyhounds are featured on day 1, which means on day 2 and day 3, Greyhounds cannot be featured.
  - Also, any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. That means Himalayans could be featured on day 2, day 3, and day 4 or day 3, day 4, and day 5 or day 4, day 5, and day 6.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4, day 5, day 6, and day 7 if Himalayans are featured on those days.

Solutions:
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days. - We have six breeds (3 kittens and 3 puppies) and only seven days. So, each breed must be featured at least once on one day. This means at least one breed is featured only once, and at least one breed is featured on four days. Thus, this option is impossible.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are. - Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1 or day 7, which means Greyhounds cannot be featured on those days either. This option is impossible.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are. - Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1 or day 7, which means Greyhounds cannot be featured on those days either. This option is impossible.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. - This option is possible if Himalayans are featured on day 2, day 3, and day 4. In this case, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4, day 5, day 6, and day 7.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not. - Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4, day 5, day 6, and day 7 if Himalayans are featured on those days. This option is possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  * Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  * No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  * Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  * Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  * Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
Solution:
The solution requires building a table to keep track of each breed featured on each day. We can use "H", "M", and "S" to represent Himalayan, Manx, and Siamese, respectively; and "G", "N", and "R" to represent Greyhound, Newfoundland, and Rottweiler, respectively. For example, the entry "H/G" in the table means that Himalayan kitten and Greyhound puppy are featured on the same day. Using the given conditions, we can fill in some entries in the table:

Day 1: G
Day 2: N/R
Day 3: 
Day 4: 
Day 5: 
Day 6: 
Day 7: 

Because no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, we know that there must be at least one day between two consecutive appearances of the same breed. Therefore, Greyhounds must be featured on day 1 and one other day. Because Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, we know that Himalayans must be featured on some combination of days 2-4, 5-7. However, Rottweilers cannot appear on any day that features Himalayans, so we must put Rottweilers on day 7, and Himalayans on some combination of days 2-4. Using trial-and-error, we can find a valid arrangement that satisfies all the conditions and produces the following table:

Day 1: G
Day 2: N/R H
Day 3: S
Day 4: M
Day 5: R
Day 6: N
Day 7: S

Now we can answer the question:
A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days. - False. Only Himalayans are featured on exactly three days.
B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are. - False. Greyhounds are not featured on days 2-4 when Himalayans are featured.
C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are. - False. Himalayans are not featured on day 1 when Greyhounds are featured.
D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. - False. Himalayans are not featured on day 7 when Rottweilers are featured, but they are also not featured on day 2 when Rottweilers are not featured.
E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not. - True. Rottweilers are featured on days 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and Himalayans are not featured on those days. Answer("E").
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Each day, a breed of kitten and puppy is featured.
  - There are exactly three breeds of kitten and three breeds of puppy.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - A breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Elimination:
  - Choice A: If four breeds are each featured on three days, the remaining breed would be featured only on one day, which violates the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Eliminated.
  - Choice B: If Himalayans are featured on all the days that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans would be featured on days 3, 5, and 6. But this violates the condition that Himalayans are not to be featured on day 1. Eliminated.
  - Choice C: Same as choice B. Eliminated.
  - Choice D: Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. But it is possible that Himalayans are not featured on some days that Rottweilers are not. Therefore, this choice could be true. 
  - Choice E: Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, but there could be other breeds of dogs that are also not featured on the same days that Himalayans are not. Therefore, this choice cannot be guaranteed.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are 3 breeds of kitten and 3 breeds of puppy.
  Each breed of kitten and puppy is featured only once on each day from day 1 to day 7.
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: It is not possible to have exactly four breeds each featured on three days since there are only seven days.
B: Greyhounds are only featured on day 1, so this statement is false.
C: Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so this statement is false.
D: This statement could be true. If Rottweilers are not featured on days 2, 3, and 5 and Himalayans are featured on those days, then they would be featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
E: This statement could be true. If Himalayans are not featured on days 2, 3, and 5 and Rottweilers are featured on those days, then Rottweilers would be featured on every day that Himalayans are not.

Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, which means that day 2 cannot feature Greyhounds.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, which means that day 7 cannot feature Greyhounds.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. This means that Himalayans can only be featured on days 2 to 6.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. This means that Rottweilers can only be featured on days 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. 

Analysis:
A: There are only six different breeds (three kittens and three puppies) and they are featured for seven days. This means that at least one of the breeds would have to be featured on fewer than three days. Thus, A is not true.
B: This is not possible because Greyhounds are only featured on day 1 and Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, so there is no day that can feature both Greyhounds and Himalayans. Thus, B is not true.
C: This is not possible because Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, but Greyhounds are featured on day 1. Thus, C is not true.
D: This is possible because Rottweilers can only be featured on days 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 and Himalayans cannot be featured on any of those days. Thus, D could be true.
E: This is not possible because Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 3, which is one of the days that Himalayans can be featured. Thus, E is not true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- There are three breeds of kitten (Himalayan, Manx, Siamese) and three breeds of puppy (Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler).
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Since there are seven days and three breeds of each animal, there must be at least one breed of kitten and one breed of puppy that is featured on two days.
- By condition 2, there must be at least two breeds of kitten and two breeds of puppy that are each featured on two days.
- By condition 3, if Greyhounds are featured on a day, then Himalayans cannot be featured on that day.
- By condition 5, Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. 

A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
- This would mean that there are 12 days total (four breeds x three days each) which is not possible given that there are only seven days. 
- Eliminate A.

B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
- This would mean that Himalayans are featured on three days and Greyhounds are featured on exactly those same three days. 
- However, by condition 3, Himalayans cannot be featured on the same days as Greyhounds. 
- Eliminate B.

C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
- This is not possible given that Himalayans are not featured on day 1, but Greyhounds are. 
- Eliminate C.

D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
- This is possible if Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
- This would mean that Rottweilers are not featured on days 2, 4, 6, or 7 (by condition 5).
- Eliminate E since it contradicts this.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
- The company plans to set two service targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- The service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- Two conditions need to be met:
  1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.

Action: 
- If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be either 1 or 2 days.
- Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, the other clients' voicemail targets must be 2 days.
- Therefore, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Solide's website target must be 2 days.
- This means that Truvest's website target cannot be 2 days. Therefore, the answer is (D) Truvest's website target is 2 days. 

Answer: (D) Truvest's website target is 2 days.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- The service targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 

If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then either Solide or Truvest must have a voicemail target of 1 day, and the other must have a voicemail target of 2 days. 

A: It is possible for Image's website target to be 1 day if Image's voicemail target is also 1 day, so this could be true.
B: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day, so this could be true.
C: If Truvest's voicemail target is 1 day, then Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days, so this could be true.
D: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day, so this could be true.
E: If Truvest's voicemail target is 1 day, then Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days, so this could be true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - There are six targets in total, two for each client—one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - The targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, it means that each of them has a voicemail target of either 2 days or 1 day. 
  The following statements are true:
  - Image's voicemail target is the shortest among the three clients, which means it must be 1 day. 
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and since the maximum website target is 3 days, Solide's website target must be 2 days or 1 day.
  - Similarly, Truvest's website target can only be 2 days or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, which means that Solide's voicemail target cannot be 2 days. 
  Therefore, the only statement that does not necessarily have to be true is A: Image's website target is 1 day. It could be 2 days if Solide's website target is also 2 days. 

Thus, the answer is A.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The six targets are divided into two groups, website targets and voicemail targets, with two targets for each of the three clients.
- The targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")
 
Explanation:
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be either 1 or 2 days. However, it is not clear what Image's website target is, so option A may or may not be true. The other statements can be inferred from the given conditions:
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must be 2 days if Truvest's website target is 3 days.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days if its website target is 2 days.
- Truvest's voicemail target cannot be 3 days, so it must be 1 or 2 days. If Truvest's website target is 3 days, then Solide's website target must be 2 days, which violates the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - None of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  From the conditions, we can deduce that there can be two combinations of the targets depending on the length of the website targets:
  
  Combination 1:
  - Image's website target = 1 day.
  - Solide's website target = 2 days.
  - Truvest's website target = 3 days.
  
  Combination 2:
  - Image's website target = 2 days.
  - Solide's website target = 1 day.
  - Truvest's website target = 2 days.
  
  From these combinations:
  - Image's voicemail target would be 1 day in both combinations, since it must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's voicemail target would be 2 days in both combinations, since it cannot be longer than its website target.
  - Truvest's voicemail target would be 2 days in Combination 1, since it cannot be longer than its website target, but it could be 1 day in Combination 2, since its website target is 2 days.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
- There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- The service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Since it's an "EXCEPT" question, I will go through each option and eliminate the one that is not true.
- Option A: If Image's website target is 1 day, then its voicemail target must be 1 day or longer, which violates the rule that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. So this option is not true.
- Option B: This is possible since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- Option C: If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, then none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days. So this option is possible.
- Option D: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be shorter than 2 days, which means Solide's website target could be 1 day, violating the rule that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. So this option is not true.
- Option E: If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days. So this option is possible.

Therefore, the answer is A: Image's website target is 1 day.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The company plans to set two service targets for each client (one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail) at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the maximum voicemail target is 2 days.
  
Analysis:
  - Since none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the maximum voicemail target is 2 days.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. So, Solide's website target can be either 1 day or 2 days. 
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Since the maximum voicemail target is 2 days, this means Image's voicemail target can only be 1 day.
  - Therefore, Image's website target must be 1 day as well, because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - This leaves Truvest's website target to be either 2 days or 3 days. However, since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target and Solide's website target is 2 days, Truvest's website target must be 3 days.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The clients are Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The service targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. 
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. 
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the following must be true:
  - Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - Solide's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - Truvest's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - Image's website target is either 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.
  - Solide's website target is either 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.
  - Truvest's website target is either 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.

Analysis:
  - From the given information, we cannot conclude that Solide's website target is 2 days (choice B) or that Truvest's website target is 2 days (choice D).
  - We know that Solide's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days, so choice C is true.
  - We know that Truvest's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days, so choice E is true.
  - We know that Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days, so its website target cannot be 3 days (from the first given condition). This means that choice A is true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
    
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  
Analysis:
  Option A is true based on condition 3.
  Option B is true based on condition 3.
  Option C is true, since none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Solide's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days, but we don't know if it is 2 days.
  Option D is false based on the given conditions, since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target and Solide's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days or 3 days.
  Option E is true, since none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Truvest's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days, but we don't know which one it is.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Six targets are set for each client according to the given conditions.
  - None of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Analyzing each choice:
  A: If Image's website target is 1 day, it means that its voicemail target must be shorter than 1 day, which complies with the given conditions. So, this choice could be true.
  B: If Solide's website target is 2 days, it means that its voicemail target must be shorter than or equal to 2 days, which complies with the given conditions. So, this choice could be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Six different photographs are to appear in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, exactly two photographs per section.
- Three photographers took the available photographs: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of their photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. If Fuentes has a photograph in the Lifestyle section and Hue has a photograph in the Metro section, then it is possible that Hue also has a photograph in the Metro section. However, it is not possible for both photographs in the Metro section to be by Fuentes because each photographer can have at most three photographs in the newspaper. It is also not possible for both photographs in the Metro section to be by Gagnon because none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Similarly, it is not possible for both photographs in the Sports section to be by Hue because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. It is also not possible for neither photograph in the Sports section to be by Hue because then there would be no way to satisfy the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - A total of 6 different photographs are to appear in the newspaper, with exactly 2 photographs per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - The photographs were taken by 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - At least one but no more than three of a photographer's photographs must appear in each section.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, this means the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes or Hue, and we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section taken by either Fuentes or Hue must also appear in the Metro section. 

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. - This cannot be true because we have already established that one of the photographs in the Metro section must be taken by the photographer whose photograph is also in the Lifestyle section, which is either Fuentes or Hue.
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - This cannot be true because there are only three photographers, and we need at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section to be by the same photographer as one in the Metro section.
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. - This could be true. One photograph in the Metro section must be taken by the same photographer as the photograph in the Lifestyle section (either Fuentes or Hue), and the remaining photograph can be taken by any of the three photographers.
D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - This cannot be true because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - This could be true. If the photograph in the Sports section taken by Fuentes is the same as the one taken by Hue in the Lifestyle section, then neither photograph in the Sports section would be by Hue.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
For this specific question: 
  - One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  
Analysis:
  - There are two photographs in the Lifestyle section, one by Fuentes and one by Hue.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - This means that either Fuentes or Hue must also have a photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue photographs in Lifestyle section. If there are 2 photographs by Fuentes in Sports section, then there must be 2 photographs by Hue in Lifestyle section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, it means that there cannot be any photographs by these two artists in the Metro or Sports sections. Therefore, the two photographs in the Metro section must be by Gagnon. For Hue and Fuentes, since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and Fuentes cannot have more than three photographs, it means that Fuentes has exactly one photograph in Sports section, which implies that Hue has exactly one photograph in the Lifestyle section. Hence, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, and neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. Therefore, the possible scenario is that both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, and this satisfies the conditions.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 6 photographs in total, 2 in each of the three sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
  - Each photograph was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be taken by either Gagnon (to satisfy the condition that each photographer must have at least one photograph) or by Fuentes (to satisfy the condition that the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section). Therefore, there are two possibilities for the Metro section: 
  1) Both photographs in the Metro section are taken by Gagnon.
  2) One photograph in the Metro section is taken by Hue and the other photograph is taken by Fuentes. 
  Option A and D are not possible because it would violate the constraints. Option E is not possible because it would violate the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, the answer is Option C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section, with each photograph taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Since one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, we know that both photographers must have at least one photograph in the Metro section based on the second condition. We do not know how many photographs each of them has in that section. 

A: Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes as we know that at least one photograph in Metro section is not taken by Fuentes.
B: Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon as we have to have at least one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue in the Lifestyle section, which leaves only the Sports section to have a photograph by Gagnon. But the last condition tells us that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section could be taken by Hue, but we cannot be sure about the other photograph.
D: Both photographs in the Sports section cannot be taken by Hue as we have to have the same number of photographs in the Sports section by Fuentes as in the Lifestyle section by Hue based on the third condition.
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is taken by Hue based on the third condition.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Six photographs will appear in total, exactly two photographs per section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, there are still different possibilities:
  - Lifestyle: Fuentes and Hue, Metro: Fuentes and Gagnon, Sports: Hue and ?.
  - Lifestyle: Fuentes and Hue, Metro: Hue and Gagnon, Sports: ? and Hue.
  - Lifestyle: Fuentes and Hue, Metro: Hue and Fuentes, Sports: ? and ?.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. -> Not possible because Fuentes already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. -> Not possible because Gagnon doesn't have any photographs in the Sports section.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. -> Possible, could be the second scenario above.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. -> Not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. -> Possible, could be the first scenario above.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photos will appear; 2 per section for 3 sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
  - Photos were taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer can have at least one but no more than three photos.
  - At least one photo in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photo in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photos in the Sports section.
  - Gagnon's photos cannot be in the Sports section.
  - One photo in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Each of the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper will have exactly two photographs.
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- The selection of photographs is subject to the following conditions:
  1. For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  2. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  3. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  4. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we can deduce that neither of them will appear in the Metro section. This means that the two photographs in the Metro section must be taken by Gagnon. 

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. - False, because Fuentes has a photograph in the Lifestyle section.
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - True, because Fuentes and Hue are not in the Metro section and none of Hue's photographs can be in the Sports section.
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. - False, because both photographs in the Metro section are taken by Gagnon.
D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - False, because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in the Sports section.
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - True, because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in the Sports section, but we already know that Fuentes has a photograph in the Lifestyle section. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - A total of six different photographs are to appear in three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section should have exactly 2 photographs.
  - Each photographer should have at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs in total.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")
  
Explanation:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there are only two possibilities for the photographer of the third photograph in the Lifestyle section: Gagnon or Hue. 
  Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, it follows that the photograph in the Sports section that is by Fuentes cannot be by Gagnon, meaning it must be by Hue. Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and both Fuentes and Hue have a photograph in the Lifestyle section, it follows that one of them also has a photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, there can be no more than one photograph in the Metro section by Hue. 
  Thus, the possible correct answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are four years to be assigned, one for each of four students, which means each year is assigned to exactly one student.
- The following conditions apply:
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922. 
- If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1924. 
- If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Onyx cannot be assigned to 1924 because of the condition that if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan is assigned to 1922. 
- This leaves only one student, Yoshio, who must be assigned to 1921.
- The statement "Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?" is essentially asking which answer choice leads to the necessary assignments.

Action: Answer("B") - If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922 based on the condition that if Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922 or 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to 1923 or 1924. Tiffany and Louis cannot be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, so this option is not possible.
- If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to 1921, and Ryan must be assigned to 1923 or 1924. Tiffany can only be assigned to 1923 and Louis can only be assigned to 1924. Yoshio is not relevant to this option.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Mollie must be assigned to 1922, then she cannot be assigned to 1921. Hence if Mollie is on the project, then she must be assigned to 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Hence, Louis can be assigned to either 1921 or 1924.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921 because if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Hence, Onyx can be assigned to either 1923 or 1924.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Hence, Tiffany can be assigned to either 1921 or 1924.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Yoshio can be assigned to either 1921, 1923, or 1924.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, only Onyx can be assigned to 1922 and Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. This means that Ryan must be assigned to 1924, which would violate the last condition.
- Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922, which means Onyx must be assigned to 1921. This satisfies all the conditions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  Four years will be assigned to the students: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Each year will have one student assigned to it.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Action: Answer("D")  
If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to the project, and if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. This means that Mollie must be assigned to 1922, because she cannot be assigned to 1923 and must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Thus, if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, Mollie must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Elimination:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. - No information about Mollie's assignment.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. - Mollie can't be assigned to 1922.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. - Ryan can't be assigned to any year.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. - Mollie's assignment is not affected by Tiffany's assignment.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. - Mollie can't be assigned to 1921.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above") Since no option is valid according to the given conditions.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924, which does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921, which could mean that Mollie is assigned to 1922. However, we cannot determine this for sure.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924, which does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923, which means that Louis must be assigned to 1924. This means that Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922 because those years would be left without any student assigned to them.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921, which does not provide any information about Mollie's assignment.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  A: We don't know anything about the year that Louis will be assigned to, so we can't determine Mollie's assignment based on this.
  B: If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie can only be assigned to 1922. This satisfies the conditions of the problem. 
  C: Onyx cannot be assigned to 1924 because Ryan must be assigned to the project if Tiffany is assigned to the project. But if Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1923. Thus, this option does not satisfy the conditions of the problem.
  D: If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923. This means that Louis can only be assigned to 1924. Since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. Thus, this option does not satisfy the conditions of the problem.
  E: If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie can only be assigned to 1922. This satisfies the conditions of the problem.

    C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. This does not affect Mollie's assignment.
    D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Louis must be assigned to 1924. This means that Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 since she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
    E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. This does not affect Mollie's assignment.
    
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Only one student can be assigned to each year.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, it does not impact Mollie's assignment.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1921, it means Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 and must be assigned to 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1924, it does not impact Mollie's assignment.
  If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, it means Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 and must be assigned to 1921.
  If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, it means Mollie must be assigned to 1922 because she cannot be assigned to 1921 if Yoshio is assigned to it.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, bay 4 must hold either produce or textiles, and bay 5 must hold the other.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so the bay holding livestock must be either bay 1 or bay 2.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain must be one of the bays 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, the bay holding machinery must be one of the remaining two bays, and the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Bay 4 is holding produce.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - There are six bays in total, and each bay is holding a different type of cargo.
  
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6
F   T   L   P   G   M

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six bays numbered from 1 through 6.
  2. There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  3. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  4. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  5. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  6. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
  According to the information given, if bay 4 is holding produce, then:
  - Bay 1 cannot be holding produce, since the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - Bay 2 cannot be holding produce, since the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - Bay 3 cannot be holding produce, since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - Bay 4 is holding produce.
  - Bay 5 cannot be holding produce, since the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - Bay 6 must be holding fuel since it is the only remaining type of cargo and the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  
  Thus, the types of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively are: fuel, textiles, livestock, produce, grain, and fuel. Therefore, for exactly 3 of the six bays (bays 2, 3, and 5), the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6.
  There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
Action: Answer("B")  
If bay 4 is holding produce, then the following can be determined:
  - Bay 5 cannot be holding produce or textiles (since the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce).
  - Bay 3 cannot be holding fuel (since the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel).
  - Bay 2 cannot be holding livestock (since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles).
  - Bay 6 cannot be holding grain (since the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock).
Therefore, for exactly three of the six bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined: bays 1, 4, and 5. So, the answer is B) three.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Bay numbers and cargo types are numbered 1 through 6 consecutively.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. 
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. 
  Produce has a higher number than fuel.
  Textiles are next to produce.

If bay 4 is holding produce, then the following must be true:
  1. The bay holding textiles must be either 3 or 5.
  2. The bay holding fuel must be either 1 or 2.
  3. The bay holding grain must be either 6 or 2.
  4. The bay holding livestock must be either 5 or 1.

Therefore, there are only two possible scenarios:
1. Produce (4), Textiles (3), Fuel (1), Machinery (2), Livestock (5), Grain (6)
2. Grain (2), Livestock (5), Textiles (4), Produce (3), Fuel (1), Machinery (6)

Only in scenario 1 the type of cargo in each bay is completely determined by knowing that bay 4 holds produce. Therefore, the answer is A - two. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce, so the bay holding fuel must be bay 1, 2, or 3. 
  The bay holding textiles cannot be bay 1 or 6, so it must be bay 2, 3, 4, or 5. 
  The bay holding livestock must be bay 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the bay holding grain must be bay 5 or 6.
  Therefore, the bay holding textiles must be bay 3 or 5.
  We can now deduce the order of the six bays and their cargo as follows:
  - Bay 1: fuel
  - Bay 2: textiles
  - Bay 3: produce
  - Bay 4: machinery
  - Bay 5: grain
  - Bay 6: livestock
  The type of cargo for bays 4 and 6 is not completely determined by the given information.
Action: Answer("4")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  - There are exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Approach:
  - If bay 4 is holding produce, we can use the given information to deduce the type of cargo held by the bays to its left and right.
  - We can then use this information to deduce the type of cargo held by bays 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.
  - We can then count the number of bays for which the type of cargo is completely determined.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Six bays are numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  - Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

If bay 4 is holding produce, the following information can be deduced:
  - Bay 4 is holding produce, which has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so bay 3 must be holding textiles.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so bay 2 must be holding livestock.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so bay 1 must be holding grain.
  - Bay 5 can only hold fuel or machinery.
  - Bay 6 can only hold the type of cargo that has not been used yet, which is machinery.

Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1 through 4 is completely determined, for a total of 4 bays.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six bays and each one is holding a different type of cargo among fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  
Using the given information, we can create the following table:

Bay # | Cargo
------|-------
  1   | 
  2   | 
  3   | 
  4   | Produce
  5   | 
  6   | 

We know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so there are only two possibilities, either bay 3 or bay 2 is holding fuel. But, we cannot determine exactly which bay is holding fuel.

The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, which means either bay 3 or bay 5 is holding textiles. But, we cannot determine exactly which bay is holding textiles.

The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, which means either bay 2 or bay 3 is holding livestock. But, we cannot determine exactly which bay is holding livestock.

The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so either bay 1 or bay 2 is holding grain. But, we cannot determine exactly which bay is holding grain.

Thus, we can determine the type of cargo for only one bay, which is bay 4. Therefore, the answer is A: two. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, the following is true:
  - The bay holding fuel must be bay 1 or bay 2.
  - The bay holding textiles must be bay 3 or bay 5.
  - The bay holding livestock must be bay 2 or bay 1.
  - The bay holding grain must be bay 6 or bay 5.
  Therefore, the types of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 can only be one of two possible options, while the type of cargo for bay 4 is already determined.

The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. The selection is constrained by the following conditions: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Question: Which one of the following is a possible selection of employees for the team?
Choices:
  A: Myers, Paine, Schmidt, and Thomson
  B: Ortega, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre
  C: Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre
  D: Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre
  E: Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The team will include at least four employees from the eight listed.
  - If Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  - If Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must be on the team.
  - If Wong is selected, both Myers and Yoder must be on the team.
  
A: Myers is selected, so neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Schmidt is also selected, so both Paine and Thomson must be on the team. However, Wong is not selected, so Myers and Yoder do not have to be on the team. Not a possible selection.
B: Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team, so Myers cannot be on the team. Not a possible selection.
C: Paine and Schmidt are both on the team, so Thomson must also be on the team. Yoder is also on the team because Wong is not selected. Possible selection.
D: Schmidt and Thomson are both on the team, so Paine must also be on the team. Yoder is also on the team because Wong is not selected. Zayre is selected to fulfill the minimum requirement of four employees. Possible selection.
E: Wong is selected, so both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Thomson is also on the team because Wong is not selected. Zayre is selected to fulfill the minimum requirement of four employees. Possible selection.

Action: Answer("C, D, and E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are eight employees to choose from: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is selected, Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  
A: Myers is on the team, so neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Schmidt is also on the team, so both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. This is not possible, because Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is selected. Therefore, option a is not possible.
B: Ortega is on the team, so neither Myers nor Yoder can be on the team. Schmidt is not on the team, so there are no restrictions on the other two members. Paine and Thomson can be selected. This is possible, so option b is a possible selection.
C: Paine is on the team, so neither Myers nor Yoder can be on the team. Schmidt is also on the team, so both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. This leaves only one more spot, which can be filled by Zayre. This is possible, so option c is a possible selection.
D: Schmidt is on the team, so both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Wong is not on the team, so there are no restrictions on the other member. Yoder can be selected. This is possible, so option d is a possible selection.
E: Wong is on the team, so Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Thomson is also selected, so Schmidt and Paine must also be on the team. This is not possible because Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is selected. Therefore, option e is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The team will include at least four employees from a total of eight employees.
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Process of elimination: 
  - Option A violates the condition that if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - Option B violates the condition that if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  - Option C violates the condition that if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  - Option D satisfies all the conditions and is a possible selection of employees for the team.
  - Option E violates the condition that if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Schmidt is on the team. Thus, Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. If Myers is on the team, both Yoder and Wong must be on the team. Since we cannot have Ortega or Paine on the team if Myers is on the team, we cannot have Myers on the team. Thus, we must have Wong on the team. So, both Yoder and Myers must be on the team. We still have one more seat to fill on the team. We cannot have Ortega or Paine on the team, so we have to go with either Thomson or Zayre. Since Thomson must already be on the team, the only choice left is Zayre. So, a possible selection of employees for the team is Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre. Hence, the answer is D.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  * A team of at least 4 employees needs to be selected from a group of 8 employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  * If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. 
  * If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. 
  * If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination: 
  * A is not possible because Myers and Paine cannot both be on the team.
  * B is not possible because Myers and Wong are not on the team.
  * C is not possible because Wong is not on the team.
  * D is possible because Schmidt is on the team, and both Paine and Thomson must also be. Wong is not on the team, so neither Myers nor Yoder needs to be. 
  * E is not possible because Wong is on the team, and both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  Option A: Myers is on the team, therefore neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
             Schmidt is on the team, therefore both Paine and Thomson must also be.
             This selection violates the constraint that neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team if Myers is on the team.
             Therefore, option A is not possible.
  
  Option B: Ortega and Paine are not on the team, which is consistent with the condition of Myers being on the team.
             Schmidt is not on the team, so there's no need for both Paine and Thomson to be on the team.
             This selection is possible.
  
  Option C: Paine is on the team, so Myers cannot be on the team.
             Schmidt is on the team, therefore both Paine and Thomson must also be.
             Yoder is on the team, which is consistent with the condition of Wong being on the team.
             This selection is possible.
  
  Option D: Schmidt is on the team, therefore both Paine and Thomson must also be.
             Yoder is on the team, which is consistent with the condition of Wong being on the team.
             This selection is possible.
  
  Option E: Wong is on the team, therefore both Myers and Yoder must also be.
             This selection violates the constraint that neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team if Myers is on the team.
             Therefore, option E is not possible.

  The team will include at least four employees out of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Elimination:
  A: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. But both Paine and Schmidt must be on the team if Schmidt is on the team. Therefore this option is not possible.
  B: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. None of them is in the team. This option is possible.
  C: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. But neither Myers nor Wong is in the team. Therefore this option is not possible.
  D: This option satisfies all three conditions. Therefore this option is possible.
  E: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Wong is in the team but neither of Myers and Yoder is in the team. Therefore this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The research team will include at least four employees from a group of eight employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  - If Myers is selected for the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - If Schmidt is selected for the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  - If Wong is selected for the team, then both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination: 
  - Option A violates the constraint that if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must be on the team.
  - Option B violates the constraint that if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  - Option C violates the constraint that if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must be on the team.
  - Option D satisfies all constraints and is a possible selection.
  - Option E violates the constraint that if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must be on the team.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The team needs to include at least four employees out of eight candidates: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  - A: Myers is selected, but both Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is. Also, Paine cannot be on the team without Thomson, which means that this combination is not possible. 
  - B: Ortega and Paine are selected, but if Myers is not on the team, selecting Ortega and Paine is possible. 
  - C: Myers and Yoder are not on the team, but if Wong is, both Myers and Yoder must also be. So, this combination is not possible. 
  - D: This combination satisfies all the constraints and is, therefore, possible.
  - E: This combination violates the constraint that if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  * The team will include at least four employees.
  * The team members must be selected from the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  * If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  * If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  * If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Elimination:
  * Option A is not possible because if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  * Option B is not possible because neither Myers nor Wong is on the team.
  * Option C is not possible because if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We know that Parra or Tiao work in Zone 1 but not both. 
  We know that Tiao or Udall work in Zone 2 but not both. 
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 

Analysis: 
  If there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than Zone 2, and more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than Zone 3, then it must be the case that there are only one or two sales representatives in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, Stuckey or Udall works in Zone 1, and Quinn works in Zone 1. There must be at least three sales representatives in Zone 3 and at most two in Zone 1. We also know that Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, so Mahr and Kim must work in Zone 3. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
- There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
- Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 (but not both).
- Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2 (but not both).
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
- There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("C") 
If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then it means that at most two sales representatives work in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra and Tiao both cannot work in Zone 3, which means that Parra works in Zone 1. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn also works in Zone 1. If two sales representatives work in Zone 3, then Udall and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2. This means that Kim, Mahr, and Quinn all work in Zone 1. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Parra works in Zone 3. Answer("C").
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. Not enough information is provided about Kim's sales zone.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2. Not enough information is provided about Mahr's sales zone.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra cannot work in Zone 3. This choice is not possible.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1. If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1. This choice is possible.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3. If Stuckey works in Zone 3 and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 3. This choice is possible.
Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Seven sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall) work in three sales zones (Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3).
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: 
  To satisfy the condition "more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3," we must have two sales representatives in Zone 1, and one sales representative in Zone 2. Therefore, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey must be in Zone 3. 
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there is only one sales representative in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 2 because Mahr must be in Zone 3.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because there are already two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao must work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  E: Udall must work in Zone 2 because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—working in three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. 
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 can only be 4, and the number of sales representatives in Zone 3 can only be 3. Therefore, Parra or Tiao and Udall cannot be both in Zone 3. 
  A: There are no clues about Kim's sales zone.
  B: There are no clues about Mahr's sales zone.
  C: Parra could not be in Zone 3 if there are more sales representatives working in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  D: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao must be in Zone 2.
  E: Udall could be in Zone 3 if there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- From the given conditions:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- From the question, we know that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.

Analysis:
- Since Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, there must be at least 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1, and at most 1 sales representative working in Zone 3.
- Since Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, there can be at most 1 sales representative working in Zone 2.
- Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, they must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 3. However, since more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, they must both be in Zone 1.
- Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, they must be either in Zone 1 or Zone 3. However, since more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, they must both be in Zone 1.
- Therefore, Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall are all in Zone 1.
- None of the options state that any sales representative works in Zone 1, so none of the options could be true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  6. If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 2 must be exactly two.

Analysis:
  - Since there are exactly seven sales representatives, if more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 must be either two or three.
  - From (1), either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both.
  - From (2), either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both.
  - From (3), Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - From (4), Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - From (5), there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - From (6), if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 2 must be exactly two.

Action: Answer("D") 
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—working in three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  More of the sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: 
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because in that case, both Parra and Tiao will work in Zone 1 which is not allowed. This means Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3. Also, since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and more representatives work in Zone 3 than Zone 2, Parra must work in Zone 3. Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey must work in Zone 1. 
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. (Possible)
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1. (Not possible)
  E: Udall works in Zone 3. (Must be true) 
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are exactly 2 sales representatives in each of Zone 1 and Zone 2, while there are more than 2 in Zone 3. 
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  
Solution:
If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the sales representatives in Zone 1 and Zone 2 are exactly 2 each. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2. Then, Stuckey and Udall both work in Zone 3. Due to the condition "Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other", Quinn also works in Zone 1. Finally, Kim, Mahr, and Parra work in Zone 1 and thus, Udall works in Zone 3 alone.
Therefore, the answer is E: Udall works in Zone 3. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
Action: 
If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 2 or 3. If Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey works in Zone 2 as well. But this would mean that Zone 2 has at least 3 sales representatives, which is not possible given that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 3, and Stuckey works in Zone 3 too. This means that Parra works in Zone 1, Quinn works in Zone 1 or Zone 3 (since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone), and Kim and Mahr work in Zone 1, Zone 2 or Zone 3. Hence, the only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3. Answer("C").

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki are testing four bicycles F, G, H, and J, in a two-day study.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day and all four bicycles are tested on each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, Yuki cannot test J, and Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then she cannot test H on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  
  A: Reynaldo cannot test F. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then J is not available for Yuki to test on the first day, and therefore it will be tested by Seamus on the first day. Thus, Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day as G will be the only remaining bicycle for Reynaldo to test on the first day, and Reynaldo cannot test F. So, A cannot be true.
  B: Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Thus, Seamus cannot test H on the first day. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then H is the only bicycle left for the second rider on the first day, and Yuki must test H. Thus, C could be true.
  D: Yuki cannot test J on the first day, and the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Thus, Seamus cannot be one of the testers for J. So, D cannot be true.
  E: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then she cannot test H on the second day. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Analysis: 
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test F. 
  Yuki cannot test J. 
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Theresa will not test G. 
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. 
  So, Yuki can only test F or G on the first day. 

A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. (Invalid because Reynaldo cannot test F)
B: Seamus tests H on the first day. (Invalid because Theresa must be one of the testers for H)
C: Yuki tests H on the second day. (Invalid because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day)
D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. (Valid. Yuki tests F on the first day and then Seamus tests J on the second day)
E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. (Invalid because Theresa must be one of the testers for H)

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) and four bicycles (F, G, H, and J).
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo cannot test F, so he cannot test G on the second day.
  B: Theresa must test H on the first day, so Seamus cannot test H on the same day. This option is not possible.
  C: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day. This option is not possible.
  D: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day. This option could be true.
  E: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then she cannot test G on the second day. This option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  There are 4 riders and 4 bicycles.

1st Day: 
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must be the one who tests H on the first day. 
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo has to test G and Yuki has to test F. 

2nd Day:
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. 
  Therefore, Seamus must test F on the second day. 
  Reynaldo cannot test G, so Reynaldo has to test J and Yuki has to test G. 

Theresa tests J on the first day, the only bicycle left for her to test is G. 
Option A is not possible because Reynaldo tests J on the second day. 
Option B is not possible because Seamus must test F on the second day. 
Option C is not possible because Yuki tests G on the second day. 
Option D is not possible because Seamus must test F on the second day. 
Therefore, the answer is E. Theresa is one of the testers for G. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  5. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day.
  6. All four bicycles are tested each day.
  
Solution:
  Let's assume that Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Then, from condition 3, we know that H must be tested on the second day. This means Yuki cannot test H on the second day (from condition 2), so Yuki tests G on the second day.
  From condition 4, we know that Seamus tests J on the second day. So we can fill in the first two days as follows:
  
  Day 1: Reynaldo - F, Seamus - ?, Theresa - J, Yuki - G
  Day 2: Reynaldo - ?, Seamus - J, Theresa - H, Yuki - ?
  
  From condition 1, we know that Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test H on the second day. This means that Seamus must test F on the first day (since he cannot test J). Therefore, we can fill in the remaining slots:
  
  Day 1: Reynaldo - H, Seamus - F, Theresa - J, Yuki - G
  Day 2: Reynaldo - G, Seamus - J, Theresa - H, Yuki - F
  
  Now we can check each option:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. - This is false, as we see from the table above that Reynaldo tests H on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day. - This is false, as we see from the table above that Seamus tests F on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. - This is false, as we see from the table above that Yuki tests F on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. - This is true, as we see from the table above that Seamus tests J on the second day.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. - This is true, as we see from the table above that Theresa tests G on the first day.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  
  If Theresa tests J on the first day:
  - Reynaldo cannot test F, so he can only test either G, H or J on the first day.
  - Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so she can only test either F, G or H on the first day. By the fifth condition, Seamus must then ride J on the second day.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so she can only test F or G on the second day.
  - Seamus must ride the bike that Yuki tests on the first day (J) on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. This is possible as the fifth condition does not prevent it.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day. This is not possible as Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. This is not possible as Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. This is true as the fifth condition requires it.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. This is possible as she can only test F or G on the second day, and the fourth condition does not restrict it.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  5. Theresa tests J on the first day.

Deduction:
- From (2), we know that Yuki cannot test J on the first day. Therefore, Yuki tests either F, G, or H on the first day.
- From (4), we know that the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, if Yuki tests F on the first day, Seamus must test F on the second day. If Yuki tests G on the first day, Seamus must test G on the second day. If Yuki tests H on the first day, Seamus must test H on the second day.
- From (3), we know that Theresa tests H. Therefore, Yuki cannot test H on the first day. Therefore, Yuki tests either F or G on the first day.
- From (5), we know that Theresa tests J on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test J on the second day. Therefore, Reynaldo tests either F, G, or H on the second day.
- From (1), we know that Reynaldo cannot test F. Therefore, Reynaldo tests either G or H on the second day.
- From (2), we know that Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, Yuki tests H on the second day.
- From (4), we know that the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, Seamus tests G on the first day.

Working backwards from the answer choices, we see that the only choice that is possible is:

Action: Answer("C") Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Theresa tests J on the first day.
  2. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  3. Yuki cannot test J.
  4. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  5. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  
  A: This is not possible because Reynaldo cannot test F.
  B: This is not possible because Theresa tests J on the first day and she cannot test H on the same day.
  C: This is not possible because Yuki cannot test J.
  D: This is not possible because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  E: This is possible. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then she cannot test H on the same day. So, the remaining bicycle that Theresa can test on the first day is either G or F. Since Reynaldo cannot test F, then Theresa tests G on the first day. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must then be either F or H, and since Yuki cannot test H, then she tests F on the first day. Seamus must then test H on the first day and J on the second day.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  On the first day, each rider tests one of the four bicycles.
  On the second day, each rider tests a different one of the four bicycles.
  All four bicycles are tested on each day. 
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  Yuki tests a bicycle on the first day that Seamus tests on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then she cannot test H on the first day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then she must test H on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo cannot test F, so he can test G on the first or second day.
     If Theresa tests J on the first day, Reynaldo cannot test J on the second day, so he must either test G, H, or F. This option is possible.
  B: Seamus cannot test a bicycle that has been tested by Yuki on the first day, so he cannot test J. Since Theresa tests J on the first day, Seamus must test either G or H on the first day. This option is not possible.
  C: Yuki tests a bicycle that Seamus will test on the second day. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day. So, Yuki must test F or H on the first day. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then she must test H on the second day. Therefore, Yuki cannot test H on the second day. This option is not possible.
  D: Seamus cannot test J on the first day because Yuki tests the bicycle that Seamus will test on the second day. This option is not possible.
  E: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then she must test H on the second day. Therefore, she cannot test G on the second day. This option is not possible.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Four riders - Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  Four bicycles - F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider will test one of the bicycles on the first day and a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test H on the first day because Theresa must test H. 
  That means Yuki must test G on the first day, and Reynaldo must test F on the first day, because no one else can test those bikes.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
  Reynaldo tests G on the second day because he cannot test F.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly 6 out of 8 students will give individual oral reports.
  - There are 3 consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) for the reports.
  - There will be two reports each day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon).
  - George can only give his report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports.
  - If Nina gives her report, then the next day (except Wednesday) Helen and Irving must give their reports as well.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there will be 6 - 2 = 4 students who will give reports. 
  The morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina - Not possible, because George can only give his report on Tuesday.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - Not possible because Robert and Helen cannot give reports on Monday morning and Helen cannot give reports on Wednesday morning.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - Not possible because Olivia can only give a morning report and Helen cannot give a report on Monday morning if Nina doesn't give her report on Monday.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - Possible, because George, Kyle, and Lenore are not giving reports and the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively will be given by Olivia, Robert, and Irving.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen - Not possible, because Helen cannot give a report on Monday morning and George can only give his report on Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly 6 students will give reports.
  2. The reports will be given in three consecutive days.
  3. Each day exactly two reports will be given, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  4. George can only give his report on Tuesday.
  5. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  6. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  7. If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the remaining students are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  
Solution:
  1. If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the remaining students are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  2. We know that George can only give his report on Tuesday. Therefore, his report cannot be in the morning on Monday or Wednesday.
  3. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must both give their reports in the morning.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. If Nina gives her report on Monday or Tuesday morning, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday; if Nina gives her report on Wednesday morning, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Monday.
  5. Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports, so the remaining students are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. Therefore, the students who can give a morning report on Monday are Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We need to determine which students could give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, given that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Solution:
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students who could give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively are:
  Monday: Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, George, and Robert (all except Kyle and Lenore)
  Tuesday: Nina (since George is giving a report on Tuesday and none of the other students in the list can give an afternoon report)
  Wednesday: Helen and Irving (since Nina is not giving a report or her report is on Wednesday)

  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Answer("A") Helen, George, and Nina.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The seminar has eight students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Six students will give oral reports during three consecutive days.
  Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we have six students left, and of these six, one must be chosen to give the morning report on each day. There are only four students who can give a morning report on Monday, and these are George, Helen, Nina, and Robert. 
  
  However, we know that George cannot give a report on Monday, so he cannot give the morning report on Monday. If we assume that Nina gives a report, then on the next day (Tuesday) Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, the morning reports on Tuesday must be given by Helen and Irving. 
  
  On Wednesday, we are left with three students - George, Olivia, and Robert. We know that Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so the afternoon reports on Wednesday must be given by George and another student. Therefore, the morning reports on Wednesday must be given by Olivia and Robert.
  
  A: Helen cannot give a morning report on Monday, since she must give a morning report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  B: Helen cannot give a morning report on Wednesday, since she must give a morning report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  C: Helen cannot give a morning report on Monday, since she must give a morning report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  D: This choice is possible, since Robert and Irving are two of the students who could give a morning report on Monday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports. However, it is not the only possible choice.
  E: George cannot give a morning report on Monday, since he cannot give a report on Monday at all. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday—exactly two reports per day.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
- Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
Action: Answer("A")

If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left to give reports. Since only Nina is mentioned in the stimulus as a possible speaker, we know that the three morning speakers must be George, Helen, and Nina. The afternoon reports on Monday and Wednesday will be given by Robert and Olivia, but it doesn't matter which order they go in. On Tuesday, Irving must give a report since he has not yet been mentioned, so the afternoon report will be given by Olivia. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, George, and Nina. Thus, the answer is A.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are eight students in the seminar: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  - Exactly six of them will give individual oral reports. 
  - The reports will be given during three consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day: one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. 
It is given that Tuesday morning is George's report.
So, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
- Monday: Nina and Robert
- Tuesday: George and Helen
- Wednesday: Olivia and Irving
The only option from the choices that has Nina, Helen, and Olivia giving morning reports is (C). Therefore, (C) is the answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. The seminar has eight students who will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  6. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
    - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the following day (Wednesday).
    - However, Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, which means Irving cannot give a report on Wednesday, so Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday.
    - If Nina doesn't give a report, there is no requirement for Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day.
    - Therefore, it is possible for Helen, George, and Nina to give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
    - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the following day (Wednesday).
    - However, Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, which means Irving cannot give a report on Wednesday, so Irving cannot give a report on Tuesday.
    - If Nina doesn't give a report, there is no requirement for Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day.
    - Therefore, it is not possible for Irving, Robert, and Helen to give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
    - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the following day (Wednesday).
    - However, Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, which means Irving cannot give a report on Wednesday, so Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday.
    - If Nina doesn't give a report, there is no requirement for Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day.
    - Also, Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so she cannot give a morning report on Wednesday.
    - Therefore, it is not possible for Nina, Helen, and Olivia to give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
    - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the following day (Wednesday).
    - However, Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, which means Irving cannot give a report on Wednesday, so Irving cannot give a report on Tuesday.
    - If Nina doesn't give a report, there is no requirement for Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day.
    - Also, Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so she cannot give a morning report on Monday.
    - Therefore, it is not possible for Olivia, Robert, and Irving to give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
    - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the following day (Wednesday).
    - However, Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, which means Irving cannot give a report on Wednesday, so Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday.
    - If Nina doesn't give a report, there is no requirement for Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day.
    - Also, Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he cannot give a morning report on Wednesday.
    - Therefore, it is not possible for Robert, George, and Helen to give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
Solution:
  - We can start by placing George on Tuesday. 
  - Then, we know that either Robert or Olivia must go on Monday morning, so let's put Robert there.
  - On Monday afternoon, the only options left are Nina and Helen, as Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports, so we'll place Nina. 
  - On Tuesday morning, we have Helen and Irving left, but we know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. So, the only possibility for Tuesday morning is Helen and Irving.
  - On Tuesday afternoon, we can place Olivia and George.
  - Finally, on Wednesday morning, we can place Nina and Irving. 
  - Therefore, the answer is (B) Irving, Robert, and Helen.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of the seminar: 6 oral reports, 2 reports per day
  - Tuesday: George must give an oral report
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday
  - Kyle and Lenore do not give reports
Action: 
  We can start with the morning reports on Monday. Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the morning reports on Monday must be from the remaining 6 students. 
  If we assume Nina gives a report on Monday, then according to the condition, both Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. However, we know George must give a report on Tuesday, so Nina cannot give a report on Monday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  We know Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give reports in the morning. We also know George must give a report on Tuesday, so the remaining morning reports on Tuesday and Wednesday must be given by the following students:
  Monday: Helen, Irving, Olivia, Robert, George
  Tuesday: Nina, ?
  Wednesday: George, ?
  Since Helen and Irving must give reports on the day after Nina's report, and Nina's report is on Wednesday, we know Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. Then, Olivia and Robert must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is:
  Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Six students give reports over three days, with two reports given each day.
  2. Conditions: 
     a) George can only give a report on Tuesday.
     b) Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
     c) If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, unless Nina gives her report on Wednesday.
  3. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  Using the process of elimination, we can determine that A, C, D, and E are incorrect. 
  * A is incorrect because it includes Kyle and Lenore, who do not give reports.
  * C is incorrect because it includes Olivia, who cannot give an afternoon report.
  * D is incorrect because it includes Robert giving an afternoon report, which is not allowed.
  * E is incorrect because it includes George giving a morning report on Monday, but he can only give a report on Tuesday.
  
  That leaves us with option B: Irving, Robert, and Helen giving reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday mornings, respectively.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf contains at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, then we know that F must be on a different shelf from I and M. From the given conditions, we know that I must be on the middle shelf, so F must be on the top or bottom shelf. We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so M must be on the same shelf as F, which means M cannot be on the middle shelf with I. Therefore, F and M must be on the same shelf, which means F and M must be on the bottom shelf with I, and the other 5 books (G, H, K, L, O) must be on the top shelf. This satisfies all of the given conditions, so it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The bookcase has 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed higher than F.
  - O is placed higher than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  
Analysis:
  - If I is on the middle shelf and F is on the same shelf as M, then we can deduce that there are only two possibilities: either F and M are both on the top shelf, or both are on the bottom shelf.
  - If K is higher than F, then K cannot be on the same shelf as F if F is on the top or middle shelf.
  - If O is higher than L, then O must be on the top shelf and L on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - In order to satisfy the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf, we must have at least 3 books on the bottom shelf and at most 2 books on the top shelf.
  - If we know that two specific books are placed on the same shelf, we can use the other conditions to determine the placement of the remaining books.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  2. Shelves: Top shelf, middle shelf, bottom shelf
  3. Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  4. More books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  5. I is on the middle shelf.
  6. K is on a higher shelf than F.
  7. O is on a higher shelf than L.
  8. F is on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  From condition 6, K is on either the top or middle shelf. But from condition 5, I is on the middle shelf. Therefore, K cannot be on the middle shelf, so it must be on the top shelf. 
  From condition 8, F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, M must be on the middle shelf. 
  From condition 5, I is on the middle shelf. Therefore, L, G, and H must be on the bottom shelf, and O must be on the top shelf.
  From condition 4, there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, M and F must be on the middle shelf together.

Answer: Answer("D") - If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then all the books can be placed on the bookcase in accordance with the given conditions.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf contains at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, it is not known where F, G, H, K, L, and O are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on. 

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, it is not known where F, H, I, L, M, and O are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on. 

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, it is known that M must also be on that shelf and the other books must be on the other two shelves. Since F is on the same shelf as M, this fully determines which of the shelves each of the 8 books is placed on. 

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, it is not known where F, G, I, K, L, and O are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on. 

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, it is not known where F, G, I, K, L, and M are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If I is placed on the middle shelf, then there are only two possible places for F and M: either both on the top or both on the bottom. This means we cannot determine fully which shelf each of the books is placed on from this condition alone.
  - If K and G are placed on the same shelf, there are multiple possibilities for the arrangement of the other books. This means we cannot determine fully which shelf each of the books is placed on from this condition alone.
  - If L and F are placed on the same shelf, there are multiple possibilities for the arrangement of the other books. This means we cannot determine fully which shelf each of the books is placed on from this condition alone.
  - If M and H are placed on the same shelf, there are only two possible places for F: either on the top with M and H or on the bottom with O and L. This means we cannot determine fully which shelf each of the books is placed on from this condition alone.
  - If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then F and L must be placed on the top and middle shelves, respectively, and K and G must be placed on the bottom shelf. This means we can fully determine which shelf each of the books is placed on if this condition is true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves and eight books are placed on the bookcase.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know they can't be placed on the top shelf since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so M and F must be placed together on the middle shelf and I must be placed on the top shelf. This leaves K, G, H, and O to be placed on the bottom shelf, which satisfies the conditions. Therefore, A is true.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F and M are placed. Therefore, B is not true.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be placed on the same shelf as well. However, we don't know where I, K, G, H, and O are placed. Therefore, C is not true.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F is placed. Therefore, D is not true.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, M, I, K, and G are placed. Therefore, E is not true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The bookcase has three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  There are eight books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Solution:
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  If L and F are on the same shelf, and F is on the same shelf as M, then L, F, and M must be on the same shelf. So, the other five books (G, H, I, K, and O) must be on the other two shelves. We know I must be on the middle shelf, and K must be on a higher shelf than F, which means K and O must be on the top shelf and bottom shelf, respectively. There will be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, all of the conditions are met and the placement of each book on each shelf is determined.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  We have 8 books - F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  We have exactly 3 shelves - top, middle and bottom
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Solution:
  First, let's try to figure out the minimum number of books on each shelf. Since we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we can't have 2 books on the bottom shelf and 2 books on the top shelf. Therefore, we must have at least 3 books on the bottom shelf and at most 2 books on the top shelf. This leaves 3 books for the middle shelf.
  
  A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then that shelf must be the middle shelf. This means we have I, M, and one other book on the middle shelf. However, we can't have 3 books on the middle shelf because we need at least 3 books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, this statement is not sufficient to determine the placement of all the books.
  
  B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, then K must be on the top shelf and G must be on the middle or bottom shelf. However, we don't know where the other books are placed, so this statement is not sufficient to determine the placement of all the books.
  
  C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then that shelf must be the middle shelf (because we know that I is also on the middle shelf). This means we have L, F, and one other book on the middle shelf. Since M is placed on the same shelf as F, it must be on the middle shelf as well. This leaves us with 4 books for the bottom shelf (G, H, K, and O). Therefore, this statement is sufficient to determine the placement of all the books.
  
  D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then that shelf must be the middle shelf (because we know that I is also on the middle shelf). This means we have M, H, and one other book on the middle shelf. Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, it must be on the middle shelf as well. This leaves us with 4 books for the bottom shelf (G, K, L, and O). Therefore, this statement is sufficient to determine the placement of all the books.
  
  E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then that shelf must be the middle shelf (because we know that I is also on the middle shelf). This means we have H, O, and one other book on the middle shelf. However, we can't have M on the middle shelf because it is placed on the same shelf as F. Therefore, this statement is not sufficient to determine the placement of all the books.
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are eight books placed on a bookcase with three shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  If I is placed on the middle shelf, then only O and L can be placed on the topmost shelf.
  Because K is placed on a higher shelf than F, F must be on the bottom shelf. 
  Because O is placed on a higher shelf than L, L must be on the bottom shelf. 
  Because F is placed on the same shelf as M, M must be on the bottom shelf. 

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, then K must be placed on the top shelf, and G,H must be placed on the middle shelf. This violates the rule that more books should be placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. Thus, A is not true.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other, then K and G must be on the top shelf, and H and I must be on the middle shelf. This violates the rule that more books should be placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. Thus, B is not true.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, then M must be on the same shelf as L and F, which is the bottom shelf. K and O must be on the top shelf, and G and H must be on the middle shelf. This satisfies all the conditions and therefore it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on. Thus, C is true.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, then G must be on the bottom shelf, and I and K must be on the top shelf. This violates the rule that F and M must be on the same shelf. Thus, D is not true.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other, then L must be on the top shelf, and G and K must be on the middle shelf. This violates the rule that O must be placed on a higher shelf than L. Thus, E is not true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The bookcase has three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  The books are F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F shares a shelf with M.

For the placement of the books on the shelves to be fully determined, there must be a unique arrangement that satisfies all the given conditions. We can eliminate options that do not provide enough information to uniquely determine the arrangement.

Elimination:
  Option A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we know that shelf must be the middle one, but we cannot determine the placement of any other book.
  Option B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of any other book.
  Option D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that shelf must be the middle one, but we cannot determine the placement of any other book.
  Option E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of any other book.

The answer is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other. If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then that shelf must be the middle one, because I cannot be on the same shelf as L or F, and K is on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, F and L must be on the middle shelf, and M must be on the same shelf as F. The remaining books, G, H, I, K, and O, must be on the bottom shelf.

        - Answer cannot be E.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  - Exactly five witnesses are scheduled to testify.
  
Analysis:
  - The schedule must have:
    * At least one witness on Monday
    * Exactly two witnesses on Tuesday
    * Two witnesses on Wednesday
  - From the rules, Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco cannot testify on Wednesday.
  - If Garcia testifies on Monday, then Hong cannot testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday, so Hong must testify on Wednesday.
  - Therefore, Franco testifies on Monday, and Jackson testifies on Tuesday.

A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. Possible. (Franco testifies on Monday, but there may be other witnesses scheduled to testify on Monday.)
B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe. Impossible. (Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and Franco cannot testify on Wednesday.)
C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday. Impossible. (Garcia testifies on Tuesday and Hong testifies on Wednesday.)
D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday. Possible. (Garcia testifies on Monday and Hong testifies on Wednesday.)
E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday. Impossible. (Jackson testifies on Tuesday and the only witnesses scheduled to testify on Monday are Franco and possibly others.)

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  We know that the schedule must meet the following conditions:
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.

A: If Franco testifies on Monday, then at least one more witness must testify on Monday to fulfill the condition that at least one witness should testify on Monday. However, the statement says that exactly five witnesses are to testify, which means that this cannot be true. Therefore, this option CAN NOT be true.
B: Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, so he cannot testify on the same day as Franco. Therefore, this option CAN NOT be true.
C: Garcia does not testify on Tuesday, so Garcia and Hong cannot testify on Tuesday together. Therefore, this option CAN NOT be true.
D: If only one witness testifies on Monday, then Franco cannot be that witness because he cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. If Hong is one of two witnesses that testify on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday. Therefore, this option CAN NOT be true.
E: Three witnesses have not been scheduled yet. Since only two witnesses testify on Tuesday, none of the three unscheduled witnesses can testify on Tuesday. Jackson must testify on Wednesday, and Hong cannot testify on Monday. Therefore, Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday. This option CAN be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing takes place on three consecutive days, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  A: If Franco testifies only on Monday, then Iturbe must testify on Wednesday and two witnesses need to testify on Tuesday. But there are only three days to hold the hearing, so this schedule cannot be possible. This can be true. 
  B: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, so this schedule cannot be possible. This cannot be true.
  C: Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, but if Hong and Garcia both testify on Tuesday, then Iturbe must testify on Monday, which is not allowed. This cannot be true.
  D: There are only three days to hold the hearing, so if Garcia testifies only on Monday, then Hong and Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, which is not allowed. This cannot be true.
  E: If Jackson testifies on Tuesday, then Franco must testify on Monday, which means that Garcia and Hong testify on Wednesday, but Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, so this schedule cannot be possible. This cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson
  - 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
B is not possible because Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday. If Franco testifies on the same day as Iturbe, then Franco must testify on either Monday or Tuesday. But then, there would only be one witness left to testify on the other day, which is not possible. Therefore, Franco must testify on Wednesday, and Iturbe cannot testify on any other day.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.

A: Franco can testify on any day of the hearing. It is not impossible.
B: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco cannot testify on Wednesday. This makes it impossible for Franco and Iturbe to testify on the same day. 
C: This scenario is possible as there are two witnesses that testify on Tuesday. 
D: Garcia cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.
E: This scenario is possible as long as one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
If Garcia and Hong both testify on Tuesday, there will be three witnesses testifying that day, which violates the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Therefore, (C) cannot be true of the schedule.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days.
  Each rider only tests one bicycle per day and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must test H on one of the two days. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test G on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo and Yuki will test F and J on the first day, but we don't know which bicylces they will test on the second day. Seamus must test J on the first day and H on the second day.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The four riders Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J on the first day.
  Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must test H.
  Yuki tests a bicycle on the first day that Seamus tests on the second day.
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she must test H on the first day.
  Therefore, G must be tested by either Reynaldo or Yuki on the first day.
  
Analysis:
  Option A is not necessarily true. Reynaldo could test either J or G on the first day.
  Option B is not necessarily true. Reynaldo could test either J or G on the first day.
  Option C is not necessarily true. Theresa could test either F or J on the first day.
  Option D is not true. Theresa must test H on the first day.
  Option E is not true. Yuki cannot test H.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will each test one of four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) on each day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine.
  Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Analysis:
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then on the first day, H must be tested by one of the remaining three riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, or Yuki. Theresa must test H, and Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, J must be tested by Reynaldo. Yuki will then test F on the first day, which means Seamus must test the remaining bike on the first day, i.e., G.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The assignments are subject to the following conditions: 
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then:
- Theresa cannot test G on the first day.
- Theresa must test H on the first day.
- Yuki must test J on the first day, so Seamus will test J on the second day.
- Reynaldo will test F or G on the first day.

Let's check each option against these conditions:   
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
     This is not possible because Reynaldo cannot test F, and Theresa must test H.
     
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
     This is possible. Reynaldo can test G, then test J on the second day.
     
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
     This is not possible because Theresa must test H on the first day.
     
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
     This is not possible because Yuki must test J on the first day.
     
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
     This is possible. Yuki can test G on the the first day. Seamus will test J and Reynaldo will test F. On the second day, Yuki will test H, Seamus will test G, Theresa will test F, and Reynaldo will test J.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Reynaldo cannot test F. 
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Solution:
If Theresa tests G on the second day, then H must be the bike Theresa tests on the first day.
If Theresa tests H on the first day, then Seamus will be testing G on the second day since Yuki cannot test J and the only bike left for Seamus is G.
From the conditions above, Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki cannot test J.
Therefore, Reynaldo must test J on the first day since Yuki cannot test J.
Hence, the answer is B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, Yuki) will each test one of four bicycles (F, G, H, J) on the first day, and then a different bicycle on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then we know that she cannot test H on that day, and Yuki must be the one who tests H on the second day. This also means Seamus must test G on the first day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test either H or J on the first day. 
Option Analysis:
  A: If Reynaldo tests H on the first day, then the remaining bicycle for the first day is F, which means Yuki cannot test it because Yuki cannot test J, and Seamus cannot test it because Seamus must test G on the first day. So, this option is not possible.
  B: If Reynaldo tests J on the first day, then the remaining bicycle for the first day is H, which means Theresa must test it. Then, the remaining bicycle for the second day is F, which means Yuki cannot test it because Yuki cannot test J, and Seamus must test J on the second day. So, this option is possible.
  C: Theresa cannot test H on the second day because Yuki must test it on the second day. So, this option is not possible.
  D: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then the remaining bicycle for the first day is H, which means Yuki must test it. Then, the remaining bicycle for the second day is F, which means Seamus must test it. So, this option is possible.
  E: We know that Yuki tests H on the second day, so this option is not possible.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. 
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. 

Working out:
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then the bicycle she tests on the first day is H.
  - Theresa tests H on the second day, so she cannot test H on the first day.
  - Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test F on the first day, and Seamus must test J on the second day.
  - Therefore, Reynaldo tests H on the first day and G on the second day.
  - Thus, the only statement that must be true is: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Theresa must test bicycle H on one of the two days.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test G on the first day.
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Seamus cannot test G on the first day.
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Yuki cannot test G on the first day.
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Reynaldo cannot test G or F on the first day.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day cannot be J.
  From the above statements, we can deduce that if Theresa tests G on the second day, then she must test H on the first day. That leaves Seamus to test F on the first day and J on the second day, and leaves Reynaldo to test G on the first day and H on the second day. Yuki must test J on the first day, which means she tests F on the second day.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Theresa tests H on one of the two days.
  Yuki tests a different bike than Seamus on the first day.
  Yuki tests neither H nor J on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, she cannot test H on the second day. 
  Therefore, she must test H on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J, so Seamus tests J on the first day and Yuki tests H.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he has to test G and Seamus has to test F on the first day.
  Therefore, Theresa tests J on the first day.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  - Theresa cannot test H on the first day because she will test G on the second day. This means that either Reynaldo or Seamus must test H on the first day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  - Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki tests F on the first day.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, so Seamus tests J on the second day.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day and H must be tested on the first day, so Reynaldo tests H on the first day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The articles are G, H, J, Q, R, S and Y.
  G, H, and J cover finance; Q, R, and S cover nutrition; and Y covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis: 
  If H is fourth, there are two possibilities: Q or R comes second. If Q comes second, then S must come first, but S cannot come first because it must be earlier than Y. If R comes second, then G must be first and J must be third. Then, H can only be sixth, and the order is fully determined.
  If H is sixth, then either Q or R is fifth. If Q is fifth, then S must be fourth, but S cannot be fourth because Y must come after S. If R is fifth, then G must come first, J must come third, and H is fourth. Then, the order is fully determined.
  If R is fourth, then G must come first, J must come third, and H must come fifth. Then, Q must be sixth, S must be seventh, and Y can only be second. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
  If R is seventh, then Q must be sixth and S must be fifth. Then, either G or J must come first, and the other one must come third. Then, H and R can only come second and fourth, but it is not clear which one comes second and which one comes fourth. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be fourth, and Q must be third. Then, either G or J must come first, and the other one must come sixth or seventh. Then, H must come second or seventh, and R must come sixth or seventh. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance.
- Three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition.
- The remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
- S must be earlier than Y.
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
- If H is fourth, then we don't know about the order of Q or S, and we don't know about the order of G, J, and R, so the order is not fully determined. Eliminate A.
- If H is sixth, then since consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other, G must be fifth and J must be seventh. This means Q and S must be in the order Q-S. Lastly, since Y must come after S, Y must be last. Therefore, the order is fully determined. Eliminate B, C, and D.
- If Y is fifth, then S must be first, which violates the rule that S must be earlier than Y. Eliminate E.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
- Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
- One article covers wildlife: Y.
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
- S must be earlier than Y.
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, there are many possibilities for the first three articles, and we know that S cannot be earlier than Q unless Q is third. We cannot determine the order of the remaining articles. 

B: If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S in that order. The fourth article cannot be another nutrition article, so it must be G or Y. If the fourth article is G, then J must be fifth and Y must be seventh. If the fourth article is Y, then J must be fifth and G must be seventh. Thus, the order is fully determined.

C: If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or Y. If the fourth article is G, then the fifth article must be J and the sixth article must be H. However, we do not know whether Y or R should be the last article. If the fourth article is Y, then the fifth article must be either G or J, but we cannot determine which one. The last two articles must be R and H, but we do not know the order. Thus, the order is not fully determined.

D: If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or Y. If the seventh article is R, then the sixth article must be H, and the fifth article must be J. The fourth article must be G if the second article is Q, or Y if the second article is S. Thus, the order is fully determined.

E: If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, G, and J in some order. However, we do not know the order of the last three articles (R, H, and Y). Thus, the order is not fully determined.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are 3 finance articles (G, H, J), 3 nutrition articles (Q, R, S), and 1 wildlife article (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  The order in which the articles are edited depends on the position of Q and S relative to each other, and the positions of J, G, and R relative to each other.
  S must be earlier than Y, so Y must be seventh.
  If S is after Q, then Q must be fourth, and R must be sixth.
  If Q is after S, then S must be third, and R must be fourth.
  If G is after J, and G is before R, then the order of the finance articles is G, J, H, and the order of the nutrition articles is Q, R, S.
  If G is before J, and J is before R, then the order of the finance articles is J, G, H, and the order of the nutrition articles is Q, R, S.
  If J is before G, and G is before R, then the order of the finance articles is J, G, H, and the order of the nutrition articles is R, Q, S.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are seven articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
- 3 cover finance, 3 cover nutrition, and 1 covers wildlife.
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
- S must be earlier than Y.
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
- If H is fourth, then either G or J is third, and the other is fifth or sixth. There are many possibilities that could satisfy the other conditions, so the order would not be fully determined. Eliminate A.
- If H is sixth, then G and J are earlier than H. By the condition that J must be earlier than G, we know that J is first, G is second, and H is sixth. By the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, we know that Q is third, S is fourth, R is fifth, and Y is seventh. This order satisfies all of the conditions, so the answer is B.
- If R is fourth, then either G or J is third and H is fifth, or Q is third and S is fifth. In the first case, we would still have to place Q, R, and Y, which could be done in multiple ways. In the second case, we would have to place G, J, H, R, and Y, which could also be done in multiple ways. Eliminate C.
- If R is seventh, then G and J are earlier than R. By the condition that J must be earlier than G, we know that J is first, G is second, and R is seventh. By the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, we know that Q is third, S is fourth, H is fifth, and Y is sixth. But we have violated the condition that G must be earlier than R, so this is not a valid order. Eliminate D.
- If Y is fifth, then S is first, Q is second, and either G or J is third. But we still have to place H, R, and Y, which could be done in multiple ways. Eliminate E.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  - Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  - One article covers wildlife: Y.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Option Analysis:
  - Option A: If H is fourth, the first three articles cannot all be about nutrition. But it is not clear what the fourth article would be. This does not fully determine the order.
  - Option B: If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be about nutrition. The fourth article cannot be about wildlife or finance. Since J must be earlier than G and G must be earlier than R, we can deduce that the order must be S-Q-R-G-J-H-Y. This fully determines the order. 
  - Option C: If R is fourth, then the first three articles cannot all be about nutrition. But it is not clear what the fourth article would be. This does not fully determine the order.
  - Option D: If R is seventh, then the first six articles must be S-Q-R-G-J-H, but it is not clear what the last article would be. This does not fully determine the order.
  - Option E: If Y is fifth, then the order must be S-Q-R-G-J-Y. However, we cannot determine the order of the last article, H. This does not fully determine the order.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Articles G, H, and J are finance articles.
  Articles Q, R, and S are nutrition articles.
  Article Y is a wildlife article.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then the order could be either Q-R-S-G-J-H-Y or R-Q-S-G-J-H-Y.
  If H is sixth, then the order could be either Q-R-S-G-J-Y-H or R-Q-S-G-J-Y-H.
  If R is fourth, then the order could be either S-Q-R-G-J-H-Y or Q-S-R-G-J-H-Y.
  If R is seventh, then the order could be either S-Q-R-G-J-H-Y or Q-S-G-J-R-H-Y.
  If Y is fifth, then the order could be either S-Q-R-G-J-Y-H or Q-S-R-G-J-Y-H.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined only if R is seventh.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles is subject to some constraints.
  Three articles cover finance, three cover nutrition, and one covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. 
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Process of elimination:
  If H is fourth, we don't know the order of the articles before H. Eliminate A.
  If H is sixth, we don't know the order of the articles before H or between Q and S. Eliminate B.
  If R is fourth, then Q must be third and S must be first or second. We still don't know the order of the finance articles before G and J, or the order of Y. Eliminate C.
  If R is seventh, we still don't know the order of the finance articles before G and J or the order of Q, S, and Y. Eliminate D.
  If Y is fifth, S must be first or second, and Q must be third. Then, G and J must be fourth and fifth, and R and H must be sixth and seventh. This satisfies all the constraints.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - 3 articles cover finance (G, H, J)
  - 3 articles cover nutrition (Q, R, S)
  - 1 article covers wildlife (Y)
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Solution:
- Since S must be earlier than Y, we know that either S is first or second. If S is first, then Q must be third, and H cannot be fourth because that would mean that two consecutive articles cover nutrition. Therefore, S must be second, and Q must be third.
- Since G must be edited before R and consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, then G must be first or second. If G is first, then J must be second. This would leave H as the only remaining article that covers finance, and it would have to be fourth, which is not allowed. Therefore, G must be second and J must be third.
- Therefore, the order of the first three articles is SQJ, and we know that Q covers nutrition. Therefore, the order of the first three articles is SQR.
- We know that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, so the next article must cover wildlife. Therefore, Y is fourth.
- We have H and R remaining to be edited, but we don't know their order yet. We know that the fifth article is not Y, so it must cover either finance or nutrition. If it covers finance, then it must be H, and if it covers nutrition, then it must be R. Therefore, the order of the first five articles is SQRHY or SQJHY.
- Finally, we have two articles remaining, H and R. We know that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, so the last article must cover finance. Therefore, H and R must be edited in the order HR or RH.
- In conclusion, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if Y is fifth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The seven articles to be edited are: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three articles (G, H, and J) cover finance.
  Three articles (Q, R, and S) cover nutrition.
  One article (Y) covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
  If H is fourth, then there are two possible orders for the nutrition articles (QRS or RSQ), but the position of the finance articles is not determined. The position of Y is also not determined. Therefore, A is not correct.
  If H is sixth, then either S or Y must be fourth, which means that either Q or R is third. This leaves only two possible orders for the finance articles (GHJ or JHG). Therefore, the order is fully determined if H is sixth. B is correct.
  If R is fourth, then S must be third, which means that Q is sixth and R is seventh. This leaves only one possible order for the finance articles (JHG). The position of Y is also determined (fifth). Therefore, C is correct.
  If R is seventh, then G must be fifth and J must be fourth. However, this means that neither Q nor S can be third, which violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, D is not correct.
  If Y is fifth, then either S or Q is fourth, which means that either Q or R is third. This leaves only two possible orders for the finance articles (GHJ or JHG). However, the position of S is not determined. Therefore, E is not correct.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The shelves are top, middle, and bottom.
  More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there must be at least 2 other books on the top shelf.
  
Analysis:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then we know that there must be at least 2 other books on the top shelf, which means that there are at most 2 books on the middle shelf. Since I is already on the middle shelf, the only other book that could be on the middle shelf is L. So the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is I and L.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is on a higher shelf than F.
  O is on a higher shelf than L.
  F is on the same shelf as M.
  If G is on the top shelf, then G cannot be on the same shelf as F or K.
  Therefore, F and K are on the middle or bottom shelves.
  
Analysis:
  If G is on the top shelf, then F and K are on the middle or bottom shelves. 
  O cannot be on the top shelf since it is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  From the condition that I is placed on the middle shelf, we know that I is not on the top shelf.
  If L is on the top shelf, then the remaining two books H and M need to be placed on the middle shelf. However, in this case, O would be placed on the same shelf as L, which is a violation of the given conditions. Therefore, L cannot be on the top shelf.
  Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, L cannot be on the bottom shelf either. Therefore, L is on the middle shelf.
  From the condition that K is on a higher shelf than F, we know that F is not on the top shelf. Therefore, F is on the middle shelf.
  The only book left to be placed on the middle shelf is H. Therefore, the complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is H, I, and L.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The middle shelf has at least two books.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - If G is placed on the top shelf, then more books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.

If G is on the top shelf, we know that:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - G is not on the same shelf as F or K or L or M.
  
Therefore, G must be on the top shelf alone. This means that there are at least two books on the middle shelf, I is one of them, and L is not on the middle shelf.

Option A is not possible, because H cannot be on the middle shelf.
Option B is not possible, because L cannot be on the middle shelf.
Option C is not possible, because L cannot be on the middle shelf.
Option D is not possible, because K cannot be on the middle shelf.
Option E is the only option left, and it is possible because F, I, and M can be on the middle shelf.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  We are given that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then we cannot have more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  At least two books are placed on each shelf.

Analysis:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then we must have more books on the middle shelf than the top shelf.
  Since I is already placed on the middle shelf, and we need to have at least two books on each shelf, then we cannot have H on the middle shelf. Therefore, we must have H and L on the same shelf, and since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the top shelf. 
  We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and since F is on the same shelf as M, then K and M must be on the bottom shelf. This leaves G, H, and L to be placed on the middle shelf.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  2. I is placed on the middle shelf.
  3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  6. If G is placed on the top shelf, there would be at least 2 books on the top shelf.
  We know that I must be placed on the middle shelf, and F is not on the middle shelf, so F must be on the top or bottom shelf. If G is on the top shelf, then there are at least two books on the top shelf, so F cannot be on the top shelf. Therefore, F must be on the bottom shelf. Since O is placed higher than L, O must be on the middle shelf and L must be on the bottom shelf. K is placed higher than F, so K and G must be on the top shelf. M is placed on the same shelf as F, so M must be on the bottom shelf. Finally, H must be on the middle shelf since there are already two books on the top shelf and two books on the bottom shelf.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf and that F is placed on the same shelf as M. So F is also on the middle shelf. 
  If G is on the top shelf, then O and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top or middle shelf, which means H and G must be on the other shelf.
  Since there are at least two books on each shelf, we can deduce that only three books can be placed on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible options are (1) H, I and (2) I, K.

Action: Answer("A") 
If G is placed on the top shelf, then the middle shelf can have only three books: H, I, and F. The remaining books K, L, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf, where there are at least three books. Therefore, the answer is (A) H, I.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom
  - The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf
  - I is placed on the middle shelf
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M
  - If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at least 2 books on the top shelf and at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  
  If G is on the top shelf, then we have two options:
  1. One more book is on the top shelf and four more books are on the bottom shelf.
  2. Two more books are on the top shelf and three more books are on the bottom shelf.
  
  In either case, I is on the middle shelf, so we can eliminate choices A, B, and C.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, which means K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, we can eliminate choice E.
  This leaves us with only one possible answer:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Eight books are placed on a 3-shelf bookcase, and each shelf has at least two books.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - If G is placed on the top shelf, then it cannot be placed on the same shelf as F and M.

Analysis:
If G is on the top shelf, then there are at least three books on that shelf. Since we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top, there are either four or five books on the bottom shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf. From the given conditions, K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the same shelf as M. O is on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the middle shelf.

Solution:
If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at least three books on that shelf. The remaining books on the top shelf are either F and M, or F (if M is on the same shelf as G). Since I is placed on the middle shelf and cannot be on the top or bottom shelf, and K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the same shelf as M, the only possible books on the middle shelf are H, I, and L. Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is I and L. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The bookcase has 3 shelves, top, middle, and bottom.
  At least 2 books are on each shelf.
  More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is on the middle shelf.
  K is on a higher shelf than F.
  O is on a higher shelf than L.
  F is on the same shelf as M.
  If G is on the top shelf, there are at least 2 other books on the top shelf.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If G is on the top shelf, then F, M, and at least one other book are on the other shelf of the top shelf. 
  I is on the middle shelf, so H and L must also be on the middle shelf in order to satisfy the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. 
  Therefore, a complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf can be I, L. 
  Hence, the answer is B.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The books are split into three shelves and the following conditions must apply:
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then only H and L can be placed with I on the middle shelf, while K must be placed with F on the bottom shelf and O must be placed with M on the remaining shelf.
  
  A: H, I - H cannot be placed on the middle shelf because there are two books required to be placed on the bottom shelf
  B: I, L - This list is possible because only H and K are required to be placed on the bottom shelf
  C: H, I, L - This list is not possible because only eight books are available
  D: I, K, L - This list is not possible because F and M are required to be on the same shelf
  E: F, I, M - This list is not possible because K and O will be on the same shelf.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Action: 
If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the following must be true:
- The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st or on June 2nd (since the table is not auctioned before the harmonica)
- The table must be auctioned on June 4th (since it is not auctioned before the vase and the mirror)
- The mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd and June 3rd, but it's unclear which comes first.
- Based on the conditions, it's possible that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, and the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the answer is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
If the table is auctioned later than the mirror and the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. 
From the conditions, we know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. 
If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp. 
Therefore, there are only two possible orders for the first four days: 
June 1st: None
June 2nd: Sundial
June 3rd: Harmonica
June 4th: Mirror
June 5th: Table
June 6th: Vase
or 
June 1st: None
June 2nd: Sundial
June 3rd: Lamp
June 4th: Mirror
June 5th: Table
June 6th: Vase
From these two possibilities, we can see that the statement "The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase" could be true. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp for the mirror to be also auctioned before the lamp.
  The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned after the mirror and vase, then the sundial and the harmonica must be auctioned before the table. 
  Only one antique is auctioned per day for six consecutive days.
  
Analysis:
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than the date on which both the mirror and vase are auctioned, then we can infer the following:
  1. The table cannot be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd because auctioning the table on these dates would violate the condition that the sundial must be auctioned before the table, and the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  2. The table must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  3. If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica and sundial must also be auctioned on June 4th, which would violate the condition that the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  4. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the analysis, the only statement that could be true if the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned is that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  - The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

Action: 
  - We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  - From the given conditions, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1 and the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase.
  - Therefore, the earliest possible date on which the table could be auctioned is June 4th.
  - Now, we check each option to see which one could be true given the information we have:
    - A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table. This is possible, as the harmonica could be auctioned on June 2nd and the table could be auctioned on June 4th.
    - B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This is not possible, as the table is auctioned on June 4th at the earliest, and the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd at the earliest.
    - C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial. This is not possible, as the table is auctioned on June 4th at the earliest, and the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and is auctioned before the table.
    - D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. This is possible, as the table could be auctioned on June 4th, the mirror could be auctioned on June 3rd, and the vase could be auctioned on June 2nd.
    - E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This is possible, as the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and the lamp could be auctioned on June 2nd.

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Six antiques are being auctioned between June 1st and June 6th.
  - Antiques being auctioned: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
  - The sundial is not being auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Action: 
  - If the table is auctioned after both the mirror and vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
  - The harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st and cannot be auctioned after the table. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  - The lamp cannot be auctioned before the harmonica. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  - The sundial must be auctioned on either June 2nd or June 3rd.
  - The only option that fits these constraints is that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the answer is (E) The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 antiques to be auctioned from June 1st to June 6th.
  Harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table and vase are the antiques to be auctioned.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If harmonica is auctioned earlier than lamp, then mirror is also auctioned earlier than lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned earlier than mirror and vase.
  Table is auctioned earlier than harmonica or vase, but not both.

Action: Answer("B")
If the table is the last to be auctioned and it is later than both the mirror and vase auctions, then the only possibility would be that the lamp was auctioned on the first day. Therefore, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Hence, the correct answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp iff the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

Action: 
If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, it means that the table will be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. 
If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table, it means that the harmonica will be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. But the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table. 
If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, it means that the table will be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, which contradicts the previous condition. So, the table cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, it means that the table will be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, which contradicts the previous condition. So, the table cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, it means that the mirror and the vase will be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. But the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. Therefore, the mirror cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, it means that the sundial and the lamp will be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. But the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Therefore, the only choice that could be true is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
 - There are 6 antiques to be auctioned: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
 - The auctions will take place over 6 consecutive days: June 1-6.
 - There are several conditions applied to the auctions:
    1. Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
    2. If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
    3. The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
    4. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Analysis: 
 - If table is auctioned after mirror and vase, then the earliest days table could be auctioned are June 4th, 5th, or 6th.
 - Harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st or before the lamp, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.
 - The earliest day that the sundial could be auctioned is June 2nd (based on condition 1). This means that the earliest day that the mirror could be auctioned is June 3rd (based on condition 3) and the earliest day the vase can be auctioned is June 4th (based on condition 3).
 - The earliest day that the table could be auctioned is June 2nd (based on condition 4), which is earlier than the dates on which the mirror and vase are auctioned.
Action: Answer("None of the above") as none of the answer choices is correct.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The antique dealer auctions exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  
Analysis:
  - We know that the table is auctioned later than the mirror and the vase. This means that the table is not auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. 
  - Additionally, we know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than either the harmonica or the vase, but not both. This means that the earliest possible date for the table is June 4th, and the latest possible date is June 6th. 
  - If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then all of the other antiques must be auctioned before it. This means that the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned earlier than June 6th, and the lamp, mirror, and sundial must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th. 
  - From the given conditions, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and the harmonica must be auctioned earlier than the lamp if the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp. This means that the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd or later, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. 
  - So, the only option that could be true is that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Action: Answer("D") 

If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then it is guaranteed that the table is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st. Hence, the harmonica must be auctioned on a later date than June 1st. Since the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase, and the sundial is auctioned on June 1st, the only way for the table to be auctioned earlier than the harmonica is for the table to be auctioned on June 2nd, which is earlier than the harmonica's auction date of June 3rd. Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Option D is the only choice that satisfies this condition.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven businesses that will be located in the shopping center: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian. 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  The veterinarian is in space 5.
  
Analysis:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, 
  then the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
  Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and the veterinarian is in space 5, 
  the pharmacy must be in space 6 and the optometrist must be in space 4 
  or the pharmacy must be in space 2 and the veterinarian must be in space 4. 
  Therefore, we can eliminate answer choices A and D. 
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 4 or space 6. 
  Therefore, we can eliminate answer choice E. 
  Since one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row from the pharmacy, 
  it must be in space 1 or space 7. Therefore, we can eliminate answer choice C. 
  This leaves answer choice B as the only possible answer. 
  If the pharmacy is at one end of the row, it must be in space 1. Therefore, answer choice B must be true. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 spaces in the shopping center, numbered 1 through 7.
  - The pharmacy must be at one of the ends (space 1 or 7), and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is located in space 5.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the veterinarian is in space 5 and the toy store cannot be next to it, the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be either in space 4 or space 6.
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one of the ends, it cannot be in space 4, so it must be in space 6.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and since one of them is at the other end of the row, the other restaurant must be between spaces 2 and 4.
  - Since the optometrist cannot be in space 1, it must be in space 2.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, a restaurant is in space 4.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in either space 4 or space 6 because it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it cannot be in space 4 or space 6. Therefore, it must be in space 3 or space 7. However, since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it cannot be in space 3. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses and the pharmacy and the toy store are at the ends, the two restaurants must be in spaces 2, 3, and 4 or in spaces 5, 6, and 7. In either case, the shoe store must be in space 6. Therefore, the answer is D: The shoe store is in space 6.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. There are seven businesses to be located in seven spaces.
  2. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  3. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  4. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  6. The veterinarian is in space 5.
Analysis: 
  From constraint 4, the pharmacy must be in either space 4 or space 6. Since a restaurant has to be at the other end of the row, space 1 or space 7 must be a restaurant. Also, from constraint 3, the two restaurants cannot be next to each other. Therefore, a restaurant cannot be in space 2 or space 6. So, space 4 must be a restaurant. From constraint 5, the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6, so it must be in space 3 or space 7. If the toy store is in space 7, then the pharmacy must be in space 4, which would mean that there would be two restaurants next to each other in spaces 5, 6, and 7, which violates constraint 3. Therefore, the toy store must be in space 3, and the pharmacy must be in space 6. The optometrist must be next to the pharmacy, so it must be in space 4. The shoe store must be in space 2, and the only space left is space 1, which must be a restaurant.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 spaces in a row: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it is in space 1 or space 7.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the other end, so it is in space 1 or space 7.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so there are at least two spaces between them.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  - If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in either space 4 or space 6 (since it is next to the veterinarian).
  - The two restaurants cannot be in space 1 and space 2, or in space 6 and space 7 (since they must be separated by at least two spaces).
  - If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the other restaurant must be in space 4, and the optometrist must be in space 2 (since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian).
  - If the pharmacy is in space 4, then the other restaurant must be in space 1, and the optometrist must be in space 2 (since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian). 
  - Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 2.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then we know that there are exactly two spaces between the two restaurants, and the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7.
  
Analysis:
  If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist must be in space 6 and the veterinarian would be next to the pharmacy, which is not allowed. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1.
  Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and the pharmacy and veterinarian must be next to one of them, we know that the restaurants must be in spaces 3 and 7 (in some order). 
  If a restaurant is in space 7, then the optometrist must be in space 6, which is not allowed, so a restaurant must be in space 3.
  Therefore, we know that spaces 2, 4, 6, and 7 must be occupied by the optometrist, the toy store, the shoe store, and the veterinarian (in some order).
  Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, we know that the toy store must be in space 4 and the shoe store in space 6.
  Thus, we can conclude that the optometrist is in space 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The veterinarian is in space 5
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

  Based on the given constraints, there are only two possible positions for the pharmacy: space 1 or space 7.
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7, which means that the two restaurants must be in spaces 2-3 and 5-6. This configuration would place the toy store next to the veterinarian in space 4, which violates the given constraint. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, and the restaurant must be in space 1. This also means that the two restaurants must be in spaces 3-4 and 5-6. The optometrist cannot be in space 2 because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Thus, the optometrist must be in space 6, which puts the shoe store in space 4. Therefore, the only option that is necessarily true is that a restaurant is in space 4. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven businesses: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy and one restaurant must be at opposite ends.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
  
Analysis:
  - The pharmacy can only be in spaces 1, 2, 4 or 6.
  - The restaurant can only be in spaces 1 or 7.
  - The toy store cannot be in spaces 4 or 6, as it will be adjacent to the veterinarian.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Hence, there are only two possible arrangements:
    1. [r_1, x, x, r_2, x, x, x] or 
    2. [x, x, x, r_2, x, x, r_1], 
       where r_1 and r_2 are the two restaurants, and x are the remaining businesses.
  - If the veterinarian is in space 5, then spaces 4 and 6 must be businesses that are not restaurants. Therefore, the first possible arrangement is not valid.
  - The second possible arrangement is valid, and since the veterinarian is in space 5, there must be a business in space 4 and a restaurant in space 7. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 7.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in space 4 or 6.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  According to the constraint, one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the pharmacy. If the pharmacy is in space 4 or 6, then the restaurant must be in space 7 or 1, respectively. If the restaurant is in space 7, then the toy store cannot be in space 6 or 4; if the restaurant is in space 1, then the toy store cannot be in space 2 or 7. So, the only possible option for the toy store is space 3. Thus, the restaurant must be in space 4. Hence, the answer is C.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The veterinarian is in space 5 and must be separated from the toy store.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and next to the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  One of the restaurants must be at the opposite end of the pharmacy.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  There are seven businesses in total, each located in one of seven spaces.
  
Analysis:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian or the optometrist. The pharmacy then must be in either space 4 or space 6. The restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7. Therefore, space 2 and space 3 must have the optometrist and the toy store, but we don't know the order. Space 4 or 6 must have the pharmacy, and the other space must have the shoe store. The only choice that must be true is that a restaurant is in space 4, since there are no other options for the restaurant.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The rugs will be woven using exactly five of the available colors: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Analysis:
  Choice A is not necessarily true because forest could be used in a solid rug. 
  Choice B is possible because forest could be used in a solid rug.
  Choice C is possible because peach is required in a rug with olive, but it is not required to be multicolored. 
  Choice D is possible because turquoise is one of the available colors. 
  Choice E is possible because yellow is one of the available colors. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are six colors of thread: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of these colors will be used to weave three rugs.
  Each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  The following rules must be followed:
    - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
    - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
    - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
    - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
    - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
    
Analysis:
  To determine which statement must be true, we need to evaluate the rules and see which statement must always be true.
  A: There can be a solid rug with forest. Also, forest and turquoise cannot be used together, but that does not mean that forest cannot be used in a multicolored rug without turquoise. Therefore, A is not necessarily true.
  B: Turquoise is excluded from being used with forest and peach, but there are no other rules preventing turquoise from being used in a multicolored rug. So B is not necessarily true.
  C: Peach is included in the rules for being used with olive, and it must also be included in a white rug, so it must be used in at least one of the rugs. Therefore, C must be true.
  D: Turquoise is excluded from being used with forest and peach, and it is also excluded from being used with peach. This means that turquoise cannot be used in any of the rugs. Therefore, D must be false.
  E: Yellow is not included in any rules for being excluded from any other colors and it must be included in a white rug, so it must be used in at least one of the rugs. Therefore, E must be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Three rugs will be woven with colored thread, five of the six colors available will be used in the rugs.
  - Each color will only be used once in the three rugs.
  - If white is used in a rug, two other colors must be used in that rug.
  - If olive is used in a rug, peach must also be used in that rug.
  - Forest and turquoise can't be used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise can't be used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow can't be used together in a rug.

A: This could be false if forest is used in a multicolored rug.
B: This could be true since turquoise can't be used with forest and peach.
C: This must be true because peach is a required color for any rug that includes olive.
D: This could be false if turquoise can't be used in any rug.
E: This must be true since yellow is the only remaining color that has not been ruled out by any of the previous restrictions.

Action: Answer("E")

  - Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: Since olive must be used with peach, and none of the other colors must be used with peach, and there are only five colors to choose from, it follows that peach must be used in one of the rugs. Therefore, C is the correct answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
To satisfy the given rules:
- Five colors will be used out of 6 available colors.
- Each color will be used in only one rug.
- White will be used in a rug with 2 other colors.
- Olive will be used with Peach in a rug.
- Forest and turquoise cannot be used together.
- Peach and turquoise cannot be used together.
- Peach and yellow cannot be used together.

A: It is possible that forest is used in one of the rugs. That rug could be solid, using only the Forest color, which satisfies all the given rules. So, this option is not necessarily true.

B: This option is true. If turquoise is used in a multicolored rug, it cannot be used with Peach or Forest. It cannot be used with White because it would have to be used with two other colors. This would violate the rules.

C: This option is true. If Peach is not used in any multicolored rug, then it would have to be used in a solid rug. In that case, it would be the only color used in that rug, violating the condition that each color is used in only one rug.

D: This option is not necessarily true. Turquoise cannot be used with Peach, but it can be used with any of the other available colors. Therefore, it is not necessary that Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.

E: This option is not necessarily true. Yellow cannot be used with Peach, but it can be used with any of the other available colors. Therefore, it is not necessary that Yellow is used in one of the rugs.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread
  - Exactly five of the six colors of thread will be used to weave the rugs
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug

A: There could be a multicolored rug in which forest is used with two other colors, so this statement is not necessarily true. 
B: Turquoise cannot be used with forest or peach, which means it can be used with olive and yellow. Thus, there could be a multicolored rug in which turquoise is used, so this statement is not necessarily true. 
C: Since peach is used in any multicolored rug in which olive is used, and olive must be used in one of the rugs, peach must also be used in one of the rugs. So, this statement must be true. 
D: Turquoise cannot be used with forest or peach, which means it can be used with olive and yellow. However, it is not clear whether it must be used in one of the rugs. Hence, this statement is not necessarily true. 
E: Yellow is not excluded from being used in a rug, and it cannot be used with peach. Since there are only five colors to choose from, one of which is yellow, yellow must be used in one of the rugs. So, this statement must be true. 

Action: Answer("CE")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 colors of thread available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly 5 colors are used to weave the 3 rugs.

  Choice A: It is possible that forest can be used in a multicolored rug, so this choice cannot be true.
  Choice B: Turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug since it cannot be used with forest, peach, or yellow. This choice could be true.
  Choice C: Since olive requires peach to be in the same rug, and each color can be used only once, peach must be used in one of the rugs. This choice must be true.
  Choice D: Turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug since it cannot be used with forest, peach, or yellow. This choice cannot be true.
  Choice E: Yellow can be used in a multicolored rug, but it is not a must since it is possible that all the rugs are solid. This choice cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The rugs will be woven out of exactly five colors.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis:
  A is not necessarily true, since we don't know if forest will be used in a multicolored rug or not.
  B is true, since turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
  C is true because if peach is not used, then olive cannot be used, which violates the constraint that peach and olive must be used together.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.

  - Choice A violates the constraint that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so it is a possible scenario.
  - Choice B is a possible scenario because each historian will give a lecture on a different topic.
  - Choice C violates the constraint that the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture, so it is a possible scenario.
  - Choice D violates the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so it is a possible scenario.
  - Choice E is a possible scenario because each historian will give a lecture on a different topic.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. 
  Oil paintings and watercolors lectures will be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

Analysis: Using the given constraints we can create a schedule of the lectures and then check which option violates the constraints.

Oil Paintings -> Watercolors -> Lithographs -> Sculptures

Farley -> Holden -> Jiang -> Garcia

Option A: Farley giving the lithographs lecture is not possible as Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which is before the lithographs lecture. Therefore, A cannot be true.

Option B: Garcia giving the sculptures lecture is possible as per the schedule of lectures we created. Therefore, B can be true.

Option C: Garcia giving the watercolors lecture is not possible as per the schedule of lectures we created. Garcia's lecture is on sculptures which is scheduled to be the last lecture. Therefore, C cannot be true.

Option D: Holden giving the oil paintings lecture is not possible as Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, and Farley's lecture is on lithographs which is scheduled to be the last lecture. Therefore, D cannot be true.

Option E: Jiang giving the watercolors lecture is not possible as Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, and Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture. Therefore, E cannot be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Seven clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, Z) have to be mentioned once per chapter from 1 to 7.
  - T can't be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, with two chapters between them.
  - S and Z can't be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X can't be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
A: R can't be mentioned in chapter 3 because if R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2 and T must be mentioned in chapter 4. Then, W would have to be mentioned in chapter 6, which would leave only chapter 5 for U and X. This would mean that X would have to be mentioned in chapter 5, which violates the constraint that U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
B: If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and R must be mentioned in chapter 4. Then, W would have to be mentioned in chapter 6, which would leave only chapter 5 for U and X. This would mean that X would have to be mentioned in chapter 5, which violates the constraint that U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
C: If T is mentioned in chapter 4, U and X must be mentioned in chapters 5 and 6 in some order. This leaves only chapter 7 for W and Z. Since Z cannot be adjacent to S, then Z must be in chapter 7, and S must be in chapter 2. Then, R can be in chapter 1 or 3.
D: U can't be mentioned in chapter 1 because U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
E: If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be in chapter 4 or 6, and T and W must be in chapters 2 and 7 in some order. However, this would mean that Z must be in chapter 3, which violates the constraint that Z can't be adjacent to S.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - The clues are mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - If W follows T, then T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  - If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then U cannot be in chapter 7 and X cannot be in chapter 1.
  - X cannot be in chapter 6 since W is not in chapter 7.
  - Therefore, X must be in chapter 5.
  - Since Z is in chapter 7 and S is not in chapter 6, then S must be in chapter 5 or earlier.
  - Since T cannot be in chapter 1 and must be before W with two chapters separating them, then T must be in chapter 2 or chapter 3 and W must be in chapter 5 or chapter 6.
  - Therefore, U must be in chapter 6 and R must be in chapter 3.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The mystery novel consists of seven chapters, each named chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  - Seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Action: 
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, S must be in chapter 3 or 4.
  - If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be in chapter 6, and X must be in chapter 7. This leaves no place for U, therefore U cannot be mentioned after T. 
  - If U is not mentioned after T, then U must be in chapter 1, and X must be in chapter 2. This satisfies the condition that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Thus, the only possible order that satisfies all constraints is: U, X, T, R, S, W, Z. This means that X is mentioned in chapter 2.
  - Therefore, the answer is B: S is mentioned in chapter 3. Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The mystery novel consists of seven chapters.
  Seven clues are mentioned exactly once, one per chapter.
  Constraints:
    T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
    T must be mentioned before W.
    There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
    S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in any other chapter.
  A: R can be mentioned in chapter 3, and it does not violate any constraints.
  B: S can be mentioned in chapter 3 if and only if Z is mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, it violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  C: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 because W must be mentioned after T, and it is not possible to have exactly two chapters separating T from W if T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  D: U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and U must be mentioned in adjacent chapters with X.
  E: X cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 because U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and if X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6. However, it is impossible to mention T in any of these two chapters since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters between T and W.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The mystery novel has seven chapters, with seven different clues - R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each chapter gets only one clue.
  - T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then:
  - It is impossible for T to be mentioned in chapter 7 since T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating T from W.
  - S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so U must be in either chapter 5 or chapter 6, and X must be in either chapter 6 or chapter 7.
  - If U is in chapter 6, then S must be in chapter 5, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Thus, U must be in chapter 5, and X must be in chapter 6.
  - R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 since S is in chapter 5, and Z is in chapter 7. So, R can only be in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  Answer: Answer("E") - X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- There are seven clues, each of which is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
- T cannot be mentioned in Chapter 1, and T must be mentioned before W.
- There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W must be mentioned in either chapter 4 or chapter 5.

Analysis:
- Since Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W must be mentioned in either chapter 4 or chapter 5.
- If W is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. This means that either R or U must be mentioned in chapter 3, and X must be mentioned in chapter 6. This leaves no chapter for S, so S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, option (B) is not possible.
- If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and U must be mentioned in chapter 2. This means that X must be mentioned in chapter 4, and S must be mentioned in chapter 6. This leaves chapter 1 for R. Therefore, option (A), (C), and (E) are not possible.
- U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, but U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, option (D) is not possible.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  Seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  Since Z is mentioned in chapter 7, neither S nor W can be the clue mentioned in chapter 6. 
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be in chapter 6, and T must be in chapter 2 or 3. 
  T cannot be in chapter 2 because we would need to skip three chapters to get to W which is not possible. 
  Therefore, T must be in chapter 3. 
  Since U and X are adjacent, U must be in chapter 5 and X must be in chapter 6. 
  Therefore, W cannot be in chapter 5 because it would be adjacent to X, so W must be in chapter 6. 
  Therefore, S cannot be in chapter 3, so it must be in chapter 5. 
  R can be in chapter 1 or 2. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z must each be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then clues S and T cannot be mentioned in chapters 6 or 5. This is because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. So, if Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or earlier.
  
  A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then there are only two chapters between T and W, which violates the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. So, this cannot be true.
  B: If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. So, this cannot be true.
  C: If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 (because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters), which means that S must be mentioned in chapter 1 or 2. This is possible, and it also satisfies the constraint that T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. So, this could be true.
  D: If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, this cannot be true.
  E: If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, this cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each chapter (1-7) must mention exactly one clue.
  - T cannot appear in chapter 1.
  - T must appear before W with two chapters separating the two clues.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then it's not possible for T to be mentioned in chapter 7 (because T must appear before W, and W must be at least two chapters after T). So, the only option left is that X appears in chapter 5, since U must appear adjacent to X and only two clues are left for chapters 6 and 7: T and W. Therefore, it is possible that X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The novel consists of seven chapters, in which seven different clues are mentioned once, one clue per chapter, with the given constraints.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then U and X must be mentioned in chapters 5 and 6, in some order.
  A: There are only two chapters separating T and W, so if T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W is mentioned in chapter 6. This means that either U or X must be mentioned in chapter 5, but we know that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so this is not possible. So, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5. This means that U and X must be mentioned in chapters 4 and 5, in some order. But then T cannot be mentioned before W, because there would be only one chapter separating them. So, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W is mentioned in chapter 6, and U and X must be mentioned in chapters 5 and 7, in some order. This leaves R and S to be mentioned in chapters 1 and 2, in some order, and Z to be mentioned in chapter 7. So, T could be mentioned in chapter 4.
  D: U and X must be mentioned in chapters 5 and 6, in some order, so U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 6. This means that Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6, so Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 7. So, X cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  2. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  3. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  4. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  5. Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Using condition 1, either Louis or Tiffany would have to be assigned to 1923. However, we know Yoshio is not assigned to the project, so at least one of them is not assigned to 1923. 

Using condition 3, if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Since Yoshio is not assigned to the project, Ryan could still be assigned to the project. 

Using condition 4, if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. If Ryan is assigned to 1924, then Onyx would have to be assigned to 1923, which is not possible because we have already established that either Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. Therefore, the only possibility is that Ryan is assigned to 1923 and Onyx is assigned to 1922. 

Using condition 2, if Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924. 

We are not given any information about whether Louis or Onyx are assigned to the project or not, so we cannot determine if options A, D, or E are true. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  There are four years to be assigned, and four students assigned to them.

Solution:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students to be assigned.
  If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then there are four students to be assigned to the four years.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx is not assigned to the project.
  Thus, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then it could be true that Louis is assigned to the project, which means that Louis could be assigned to any of the remaining years 1921, 1922, or 1924.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are 4 years and 4 students assigned to these years, and each year will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there are only five students available for the project. This means that only one of Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and since Yoshio is not assigned to the project, this means that Louis, Mollie, and Onyx will be assigned to the project, with either Tiffany or Ryan being assigned to 1923. 
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means that Louis and Onyx will be assigned to 1921 and 1922. 
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which means that Mollie and Louis will be assigned to 1921 and 1922.

Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, it could be true that Ryan is not assigned to the project.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Each of the four years (1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924) will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: 
  To determine which option could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project we can use the following logic:
  
  - If Yoshio is not assigned, then the remaining 5 students will be assigned to the project.
  - Since there are 4 years and each year must be assigned to one student, at least one of the remaining students (Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, or Tiffany) will not be assigned to the project.
  
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project. - This could be true, as long as the remaining four students are assigned to the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project. - This cannot be true, because if Ryan is not assigned to the project, then neither is Onyx, which would violate the rule that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project. - This could be true, as long as Louis is assigned to 1923 and Ryan is assigned to a year other than 1923.
  
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922. - This could be true, as long as Louis is assigned to 1923 and Ryan is assigned to 1924.
  
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924. - This could be true, as long as Tiffany is assigned to 1923, Ryan is assigned to 1922, and Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  
  Therefore, the answer is: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for this project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  
Answer: "D"
Explanation: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for this project. 
  Since Ryan must be assigned to the project if Tiffany is assigned to it, and Yoshio is not available, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. 
  Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1923. 
  If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then she cannot be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, so Louis must be assigned to one of these years. 
  If Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, then this means that Ryan must be assigned to 1924. 
  If Ryan is assigned to 1924, then Louis must be assigned to 1922, which means that Onyx must be assigned to 1923. 
  Therefore, it is possible that Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are four students assigned to four different years.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Analysis:
  - Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923, which means Louis must be assigned to it.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to any year, which is not allowed.
  - If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then any of the years (1921, 1922, 1923, or 1924) could be assigned to the remaining students.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, which is not allowed.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to the project, which is not allowed because Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project, Ryan must be assigned to it, and Onyx must be assigned to 1922. However, this is not possible because Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.
  
Action: Answer("B") - Ryan is not assigned to the project.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  There are four years to be assigned and four students to be assigned to them, one student per year.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are five students available for four years.
Action: Answer("D") 
Exlpanation: If Yoshio is not assigned, then there are five students available for a four-year project. If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Louis must be assigned to 1921, Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to 1924. This assignment satisfies all of the conditions of the problem. Therefore, Onyx being assigned to 1922 could be true.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Each year has exactly one student assigned to it.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Yoshio is not assigned, there will be five students remaining to be assigned to the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  We need to find an answer that is consistent with the given conditions and the fact that Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Elimination:
  A: If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there are only four students left to be assigned to the four years. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to the project, and this answer is not possible.
  B: This answer is possible. If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, and Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923, so Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, leaving Mollie to be assigned to 1921 and Louis to be assigned to 1922.
  C: If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany and Ryan must be assigned to 1922 and 1924, respectively. This leaves only two students, Mollie and Onyx, to be assigned to 1921 and 1923. Therefore, this answer is not possible.
  D: This answer is possible. If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, and Louis must be assigned to 1921, which leaves only Mollie to be assigned to 1922.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which means that Ryan must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Tiffany's, which is not possible because Onyx is already assigned to 1922. Therefore, this answer is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - Each year will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  - The six students available are Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - If Louis or Tiffany is assigned to the project, only Tiffany or Louis, respectively, can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, we still have enough students to fill the four-year project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany. Therefore, each year can still be assigned to one student. 
If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 and only Tiffany or Louis can be assigned to 1924. If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, the assignment possibilities are:
- 1921: Mollie
- 1922: Onyx
- 1923: Ryan and Tiffany/Louis (depending on who is assigned to the project)
- 1924: Tiffany/Louis (whoever is not assigned to 1923)
Therefore, option D, "Onyx is assigned to 1922", could be true.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The project has four years and four students, one assigned to each year.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  We need to find a statement that could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project. 
  
Analysis:
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, and Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then we would only have four students to assign to four years, and all conditions would be met. Therefore, statement A could be true.
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, and Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the condition "If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's" would not apply. Therefore, statement B could not be true.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, and Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the condition "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923" would not apply. Therefore, statement C could not be true.
  - If Onyx is assigned to 1922, and Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Mollie could be assigned to 1921, and Louis or Tiffany could be assigned to 1923 (the only year left). Then Ryan would be the only one left and would have to be assigned to 1924, which would make the condition "If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's" true. Therefore, statement D could be true.
  - If Louis is assigned to 1924, and Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then only one of Louis or Tiffany could be assigned to 1923. However, we would still need to assign Mollie, Ryan, and Onyx to the other three years, and the conditions would not be met. Therefore, statement E could not be true.

The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order, from first through seventh, in which the realtor shows the houses?
Choices:
  A: K, 0, L, M, N, J, P
  B: N, L, P, K, M, 0, J
  C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J
  D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J
  E: P, 0, K, J, L, N, M
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. The first two houses are shown in the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth houses are shown in the afternoon, and the sixth and seventh houses are shown in the evening. 
  2. J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  3. K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  4. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L must be either the fourth or fifth house shown.

Elimination:
  A. K is shown first, which is not possible because K cannot be shown in the morning.
  B. L is shown second, which is not possible because the second house is shown in the morning.
  C. L is shown fourth, which is possible because K is shown before L and M is shown after L. The other houses are shown in a way that follows the given rules.
  D. M is shown third, which is not possible because the third, fourth, and fifth houses are shown in the afternoon.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring.
  2. If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall.
  3. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  4. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring, and P must be published in the fall. That means K and O must also be published in the fall, and L must be published in the spring. So the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore K and O must be published in the fall. P must be published in the spring. L can be published in either the fall or spring.
  
  Possible pairs of cookbooks that can be published in the fall along with M are K and O.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, which means that K must be published in the spring as well. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall, which is not possible since M is published in the fall.
  A: K and O must be published in the fall together if K is published in the fall, which is not possible since M is published in the fall.
  B: If M is published in the fall, L and N can be published in the fall. This is a possible pair.
  C: If L is published in the fall, O must be published in the fall. This is not possible because M cannot be published in the fall if N is also published in the fall.
  D: P cannot be published in the same season as M, so this is not a possible pair.
  E: O must be published in the fall if K is published in the fall, which is not possible since M is published in the fall. P cannot be published in the fall with M, so this is not a possible pair.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Process:
  - If M is in fall, then N must be in spring.
  - If K is in fall, then O must be in fall.
  - Thus, K and N will be on fall, and O will not be in fall.
  - P cannot be in fall, because M is in fall.
  - So the only pair that can be published in the fall along with M is K and 0.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. So, M and N cannot be part of the same season. Also, M and P cannot be published in the same season. Therefore, M must be published in the fall along with K and O. Therefore, the answer is A: K and O. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
- K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
- If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
- If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

If M is published in the fall, it means that N must be published in the spring and cannot be published in the fall. Therefore, we can eliminate choices (A), (B), and (C) since they include N as an answer. 

P cannot be published in the fall because it cannot be published in the same season as M. Therefore, we can eliminate choice (E).

That leaves us with only one choice:
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  M cannot be published in the same season as P.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, meaning that N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall, so the only combination of cookbooks that can be published in the fall if M is published in the fall is K and O.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  
Elimination:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, so we can eliminate choices A and B.
  N must be in the same season as K, so we can eliminate choice D.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall, so we cannot have K in the fall and choice C, L and O in the fall.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  Since M is published in the fall, we cannot have P in the fall, so P must be in the spring. Since K and N must be published in the same season, and we cannot have K in the fall, K and N must be in the spring. Finally, since O must be in the same season as K, it must also be in the spring. Thus, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is O and L.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
  
Analysis:
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  - Since K and N must be published in the same season, K cannot be published in the fall with M, because if K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M are L and O.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. M is published in the fall.
  2. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  3. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  4. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  5. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

Analysis:
  - Since M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. So, N cannot be the answer.
  - P cannot be published in the same season as M. So P cannot be the answer.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. So, K and O can only be published in the fall together.
  - Hence, the only valid pair of cookbooks that could be published in the fall along with M is L and O.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The compositions must be performed consecutively and one composition at a time.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the following compositions must be before it: O or H/L, F or T, and P.
  Only option D satisfies this condition.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then we have the following possible cases:
  - Case 1: O is performed first
  - Case 2: O is performed fifth

Option A: F, H, P
- F and P must be played after S, so they cannot be played first and second. 
- L or H must be the eighth song, so H cannot be played third. 
- S is played fourth, so A is not possible

Option B: H, P, L
- F and P must be played after S, so F cannot be played first. 
- L or H must be the eighth song. So, L cannot be played third. 
- S is played fourth
- This option satisfies all the conditions.

Option C: O, P, R
- F and P must be played after S, so neither F nor P can be played first.
- O must be played first or fifth, so it cannot be played in second or third place.
- L or H must be the eighth song, so neither L nor H can be played third
- S is played fourth, so C is not possible

Option D: O, P, T
- F and P must be played after S, so neither F nor P can be played first.
- O must be played first or fifth, so it can be played first
- T is played either immediately before F or immediately after R, but R cannot be played in the first three compositions
- L or H must be the eighth song, so neither L nor H can be played third
- S is played fourth, so D is not possible

Option E: P, R, T
- F and P must be played after S, so F cannot be played first.
- T is played either immediately before F or immediately after R, so T cannot be played third.
- L or H must be the eighth song, so neither L nor H can be played third
- S is played fourth, so E is not possible

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are eight compositions: F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T.
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of performances must be one of the following:
  * _ _ _ S _ _ _ _
  * _ _ _ _ S _ _ _
  * _ _ _ _ _ S _ _
  * _ _ _ _ _ _ S _
  
  We can eliminate options C, D, and E because they each start with O or P, which contradicts the given conditions.
  Option A is also not possible because P is performed before S and also as early as third, which means it cannot be the last composition performed.
  Thus, the correct answer must be B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the possible position for the compositions is:
  1- O
  2- R or F
  3- L or H
  4- S
  5- P
  6- T or F
  7- F or R
  8- H or L
  
  A: F, H, P -> H or F cannot be in position 7
  B: H, P. L -> H or L cannot be in position 8
  C: O, P, R -> Correct, this satisfies all conditions.
  D: O, P, T -> T cannot be in position 6
  E: P, R, T -> This violates the condition that S must be performed fourth.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  3. O is performed either first or fifth.
  4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  5. P is performed at some time before S.
  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
The order of compositions should satisfy all the above conditions.
If S is performed fourth, then the compositions before S must be O, P and one other composition. Compositions after S must include at least one composition before F or after R. Therefore, the compositions before S cannot be F or R, because that would mean that there is only one composition between the two. 
Choice C satisfies all the conditions in the problem, including the requirement that O is either first or fifth. Hence, the answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The compositions to be performed are F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then compositions that can be performed before S are O, F, R, T, H, L and P.
  
  A: F, H, P - F and H cannot be performed before S. Incorrect.
  B: H, P. L - P can be performed before S. Incorrect.
  C: O, P, R - O can be performed before S. Correct.
  D: O, P, T - O can be performed before S. Incorrect.
  E: P, R, T - P cannot be performed before S. Incorrect.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, it means:
  - O is performed either first or fifth, so P cannot be first.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H, so neither of them can be first.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O, so F cannot be first since it is one of the compositions that must be played between O and S.
  
  If F is played after S, then either R or T must be played before S, which violates the condition that P must be played before S. Therefore, F must be played before S. If F is second, then H and L cannot be played earlier since they are the 8th compositions to be played. Therefore, O must be played first, and P must be played third. This satisfies all the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The compositions to be performed are: F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
Analysis:
  If S is performed fourth, the compositions that could be performed before it are O, F, R, H, L, and P. 
  However, since P must be performed before S, the possible compositions before S are O, F, R, H, and L.
  Since O is performed either first or fifth, if S is fourth, then O must be first.
  The compositions that could be performed after S are F, R, H, L, and T.
  Since T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, the possible compositions after S are F, R, H, and L.
  However, since the eighth composition must be L or H and P must be before S, the possible compositions after S are F, R, and H.
  If at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and one of them is S, then S must be performed after R and before F.
  So, the possible order of compositions performed are O, R, S, F, followed by any combination of H, P, and L.

Action: Answer("D") - O, P, T
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the following conditions must hold:
  - If S is fourth, then P is performed before S.
  - If P is before S, then O cannot be the first composition performed. Therefore, O must be the fifth composition performed.
  - Since O is performed fifth, and P is before S, then either F or R must be performed immediately before or after T. Therefore, F or R must be performed last. Since the eighth composition performed is either L or H, then we have two possibilities for the order of the last four compositions: L-H-F-R or H-L-F-R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, if F or R is performed last, then at least two compositions must be performed between T and F or between T and R.
  Taking into account all these conditions, the only possible order for the first three compositions is O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H. 
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions could be one of the following:
  - O _ _ : The only composition that can be performed fifth is either L or H. This means that F and R must be performed together, either before or after the compositions performed between them. However, since S is performed fourth, P cannot be performed before S. Therefore, P must be performed after F and R. This leaves only compositions H and L to be performed between F and R. However, one of them must be the eighth composition performed, which is not possible since O is already performed. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - P O _ : The only composition that can be performed fifth is either L or H. The compositions performed after P and before S must be F, R, and either H or L. Therefore, the compositions performed between O and S must be H, L, and either F or R. However, one of them must be the eighth composition performed, which is not possible since O is already performed. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - _ P O : The only composition that can be performed fifth is either L or H. The compositions performed after S and before the eighth composition must be F, R, and either H or L. Therefore, the compositions performed between the first composition and S must be H, L, and either F or R. Since O must be performed first, the order of the first three compositions can be O, P, and T. This satisfies all the given conditions.
  - _ O P : The only composition that can be performed fifth is either L or H. The compositions performed after S and before the eighth composition must be F, R, and either H or L. Therefore, the compositions performed between the first composition and S must be H, L, and either F or R. Since O must be performed first, the order of the first three compositions can be O, P, and either F or R. However, one of them must be the eighth composition performed, which is not possible since either H or L must be the eighth composition performed.
  - _ _ P : Since S is performed fourth, the compositions performed before S must be O, either F or R, and either H or L. The order of the first three compositions can be either O, F, and H or O, R, and L. However, this leaves no compositions to be performed between F and R, which violates the given conditions.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Livestock must be in either bay 5 or 6, since it must be in a higher number bay than the bay holding textiles. 
  Bay 5 and 6 cannot hold machinery or produce, since produce must be in a higher number bay than the bay holding fuel, which in turn must be in a higher number bay than machinery. 
  This leaves grain or textiles to be in Bay 4, and since livestock is not in Bay 4, it follows that Bay 4 cannot hold livestock.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six bays numbered from 1 to 6.
  2. There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  3. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  4. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  5. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  6. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Using the given rules, we can create the following table:

Bay | Cargo
--- | -----
  1 | fuel
  2 | textiles
  3 | produce
  4 | ?
  5 | grain
  6 | livestock

Option C: Machinery could be in any of the remaining bays, so it is possible that bay 4 contains machinery.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo and Bay 6 holds another.
  The type of cargo held in Bay 4 cannot be livestock or grain.
  Bay 4 is next to the bay holding produce which has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.

Elimination:
  Since Bay 4 is next to the bay holding produce, there are only two possible types of cargo that can be held there: machinery or textiles.
  Machinery cannot be held in Bay 4 because Bay 4 is not the bay holding grain, and the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding machinery.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 bays numbered 1 through 6 from one side of the dock to the other and each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Bay 4 is located in the middle of the dock.
  
Analysis:
  We can eliminate grain (choice A) and livestock (choice B) because they must be located in bays 5 and 6 in some order.
  We can eliminate produce (choice D) because it must be located in bay 6.
  We can eliminate textiles (choice E) because it is next to the bay holding produce, which must be located in bay 6.
  We are left with machinery (choice C) as a possible cargo held in bay 4.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively.
  - There are exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - Bay holding Grain > Bay holding Livestock
  - Bay holding Livestock > Bay holding Textiles
  - Bay holding Produce > Bay holding Fuel
  - Bay holding Textiles is next to Bay holding Produce
  - We are asked which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
  
Analysis:
  - Bay 4 is not the first or the last bay, so it can be next to two other bays.
  - From the rule "Bay holding Textiles is next to Bay holding Produce", we know that Bay 3 or Bay 5 is holding Textiles.
  - If Bay 3 holds Textiles, then Bay 4 must hold Produce, which contradicts the rule "Bay holding Produce > Bay holding Fuel". Therefore, Bay 3 cannot hold Textiles, it must hold Produce.
  - So, Bay 5 holds Textiles.
  - We have the following sequence now: [Fuel, Produce, Textiles, Livestock, Grain, Machinery]
  - Therefore, the cargo held in Bay 4 cannot be Livestock, because Bay 4 is between Textiles and Grain bays, and we know that Livestock bay is located before the Textiles bay.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo. Bay 2 holds another. And so on, through Bay 6.
  Six types of cargo are: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  The bay holding grain > the bay holding livestock
  The bay holding livestock > the bay holding textiles
  The bay holding produce > the bay holding fuel
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce

Bay 1     Bay 2     Bay 3     Bay 4     Bay 5     Bay 6
-------   -------   -------   -------   -------   -------
  ?          ?        ?       CANNOT BE  ?         ?  

Elimination:
  We can eliminate A, B, D and E as potential answers, because each of those types of cargo could possibly be held in Bay 4, based on the given constraints.
  C: Machinery could not be held in Bay 4 because Bay 4 must be next to the bay holding textiles. The only types of cargo that can be next to a bay holding textiles is either a bay holding produce or a bay holding livestock. Therefore, machinery CANNOT be held in Bay 4.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  5. There are 6 bays numbered consecutively from 1 to 6.

To determine the answer, we need to find the possible types of cargo that could be held in bays 1 to 3 and 5 to 6 based on the given information and then determine which of those could not be held in bay 4.

Based on the first two statements, we can deduce that bay 6 holds grain and bay 5 holds livestock. Based on the fourth statement, we can deduce that either bay 3 or bay 4 holds textiles and the other holds produce. If bay 3 holds textiles, then bay 4 holds produce. If bay 3 holds produce, then bay 4 holds textiles. Based on the third statement, we know that bay 1 holds fuel.

Therefore, the possible types of cargo for bays 1 to 6 are:
Bay 1: fuel
Bay 2: machinery
Bay 3: produce or textiles
Bay 4: textiles or produce
Bay 5: livestock
Bay 6: grain

Thus, the type of cargo that CANNOT be held in bay 4 is machinery, which is not one of the six types of cargo given in the problem.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo.
  Bay 2 holds one of the remaining five types of cargo.
  Bay 3 holds one of the remaining four types of cargo.
  Bay 4 holds one of the remaining three types of cargo.
  Bay 5 holds one of the remaining two types of cargo.
  Bay 6 holds the remaining one type of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. 
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. 
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. 
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  If bay 4 holds machinery, then bay 3 must hold textiles, which is adjacent to bay 4. 
  Then, by the rules, bay 5 must hold produce, and bay 6 must hold fuel. 
  Thus, bay 1 must hold grain and bay 2 must hold livestock, which violates the rule that the bay holding grain is numbered higher than the bay holding livestock. 
  Therefore, machinery cannot be held in bay 4.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds either fuel or produce.
  Bay holding produce is adjacent to the bay holding textile.
  Bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  Six bays are numbered consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  
Analysis:
  From the given information, bay 6 holds either grain or livestock since it has the highest number. 
  Bay 5 holds either produce or fuel.
  Bay 3 holds either produce or fuel, but not the same type as Bay 5.
  Bay 2 holds either livestock or grain, but not the same type as Bay 6.
  Bay 1 holds either fuel or produce.
  Therefore, Bay 4 can only hold machinery or textiles.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Bay 4 is holding one of the six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
First, we can use the rule that the bay holding grain has a higher number than livestock to eliminate option A, grain, since it cannot be in Bay 4 if livestock is in a higher numbered bay than the one holding grain.
Next, the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Since textiles is next to the bay holding produce, if produce was in bay 4, then Bay 3 would be textiles, Bay 5 would be fuel, and Bay 6 would be machinery. This means livestock would have to be in Bay 2 and grain would have to be in Bay 1, which violates the rule that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. So, we can eliminate option D, produce.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs).
  - Each student will display exactly two paintings (an oil and a watercolor).
  - Two paintings will be displayed on each wall (walls 1, 2, 3, and 4).
  - No wall has only watercolors.
  - No wall has only one student's work.
  - No wall has both Franz's and Isaacs's work.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position on wall 4.

Action: Answer("D")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the only two possible walls for these paintings are walls 1 and 2. This means that Greene's watercolor is displayed on either wall 3 or 4. 
Since neither wall 3 nor wall 4 can have only watercolors, Greene must have an oil displayed on the same wall as his watercolor, which means that Greene's oil is displayed in a lower position on wall 1 or 2. 
This means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor in order to satisfy all the conditions. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, making Choice D the correct answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students displaying two paintings each.
  - Two paintings are displayed on each of the walls 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  - One painting is in the upper position and one in the lower position on each wall.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the wall in question must contain one painting by Greene and one painting by Franz. Because Greene's watercolor is already placed in the upper position of the wall where Franz's oil is displayed, the other painting by Greene on this wall must be an oil. This means that on this wall, Franz's watercolor must be in the lower position. Since Hidalgo cannot share a wall with both Isaacs and Franz, and since Isaacs's oil is already placed in the lower position on wall 4, Hidalgo's oil must go on either wall 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil could be displayed in an upper position on one of those walls. Thus, the correct answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four walls has two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - Each of the four students displays exactly two paintings, an oil, and a watercolor.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must also be on that wall, to satisfy the condition that there is no wall with the work of only one student displayed on it.

Analysis:
  - Hidalgo's paintings cannot be both on the same wall as Isaacs's paintings and on the same wall as Franz's paintings because that would result in a wall with the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - If Hidalgo's paintings are on the same wall as Greene's watercolor, then Hidalgo's oil must be in the upper position, to satisfy the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in the lower position, then Isaacs's oil must be in the upper position, to satisfy the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Two paintings each: an oil and a watercolor.
  Two paintings displayed on each wall: one upper, one lower.
  No wall has only watercolors.
  No wall has one student's work only.
  No wall has both Franz's and Isaacs's work.
  Greene's watercolor is on the upper position of the wall with Franz's oil.
  Isaacs's oil is on the lower position of wall 4.
Context: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, that means it is not displayed on wall 1 because that wall already has one of Franz's paintings. And it is not displayed on wall 4 because Isaacs's oil is already displayed in the lower position. Therefore, Greene's oil must be on either wall 2 or wall 3. 
  From the given information, we know that no wall can have only watercolors. Therefore, each wall must have an oil painting. Hidalgo is the only student left without their painting on a wall, so their oil must be on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. Hence, Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, so the answer is D.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each of the four walls must have one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  2. No wall may have only watercolors on it.
  3. No wall may have only one student's work on it.
  4. No wall may have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the wall must have Greene's watercolor in the upper position and Franz's oil in the lower position.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, it must be displayed in the lower position. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall from Isaacs's watercolor. Since each wall must have one oil painting and one watercolor painting, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 3, and Isaacs's oil must be displayed in the lower position of wall 2. This means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings (one oil and one watercolor) with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
To determine which one of the following must be true, we need to use the condition that Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor. 

Analysis:
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Franz's oil must be displayed in the upper position on the same wall, and Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position on the same wall (based on the condition that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed).
  - Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, we can deduce that Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on different walls than Franz's, Greene's, and Isaacs's paintings.
  - We know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, which means that Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 1, wall 2, or wall 3.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, Isaacs.
  - Each student displays exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings in the upper and lower positions.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be on a different wall. According to the given conditions, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed in the lower position of this wall. This means that Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on the same wall, which cannot be wall 4 since Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4. Thus, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 1, 2, or 3. However, we know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor (which is on wall 4). Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. This eliminates choices A, B, and D. We already know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so choice E must also be true. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are art students displaying paintings in an exhibition.
  - Each student is displaying exactly two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of that wall.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of that wall (because Isaacs's oil is already displayed on wall 4 in the lower position).
  - Therefore, the wall with Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor must have either Hidalgo's paintings or a combination of Hidalgo's and Isaacs's paintings.
  - Wall 4 already has Isaacs's oil, so Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on a different wall.
  - Thus, the only possible option is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in the upper position on one of the walls that has Isaacs's watercolor displayed on it. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. 

Therefore, the answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has exactly 1 oil painting and 1 watercolor painting.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

We know that Franz has an oil painting and a watercolor painting, and that Isaacs has an oil painting and a watercolor painting. However, we do not know which wall their paintings are being displayed on. We also know that Greene's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil, but we do not know which wall that is. 

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that wall cannot have both of Isaacs's paintings (because no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it). Therefore, Isaacs's other painting, the watercolor, must be displayed on a different wall.

Also, because we know that each wall has exactly one oil painting and one watercolor painting, if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene must have a watercolor painting displayed on another wall and that wall cannot have Isaacs's watercolor painting on it (because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it). 

Now let's consider each of the answer choices:

A: We do not have enough information to determine whether or not this must be true.
B: This could be true, but we cannot say for certain based on the information given.
C: Since we know that Hidalgo cannot have both of Isaacs's paintings displayed on their wall, and we know that Isaacs's watercolor painting is not on the same wall as Greene's oil painting, it must be the case that Hidalgo's oil painting is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor painting. Therefore, this statement must be true.
D: We do not have enough information to determine whether or not this must be true.
E: We know that Isaacs's watercolor painting is not on the same wall as Greene's oil painting, so it must be on a different wall. Therefore, this statement must be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Each of the four students displays one oil and one watercolor.
  2. Each wall has one upper position and one lower position.
  3. No wall has only watercolors.
  4. No wall has the work of only one student.
  5. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
  6. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

To be true:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
  - Franz's oil is not displayed in the same wall since it would violate condition 5.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the same wall, in the upper position, according to condition 6.
  - This means that Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the same wall.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's paintings cannot be displayed on the same wall as Greene's and Franz's, since it would violate condition 4.
  - Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on either walls 1 and 3, or on walls 2 and 3.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of the same wall.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, since it would violate condition 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be
Choices:
  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant
  B: the pharmacy and the toy store
  C: the two restaurants
  D: a restaurant and the toy store
  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The optometrist is next to the shoe store.
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Action: Answer("D") 
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there is only one possible arrangement for the immediate businesses on either side of this pair: the toy store and a restaurant. Hence, the answer is (D) a restaurant and the toy store.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The optometrist is next to the shoe store.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses and one of them must be at the opposite end of the row from the pharmacy.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Process of elimination:
  - The pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist because the shoe store is already next to the optometrist.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be next to the toy store or the veterinarian.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be next to the shoe store or the optometrist.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row from the pharmacy, so it cannot be next to the shoe store or the optometrist.

Conclusion:
  The only possibility is that the optometrist is next to the shoe store with the pharmacy next to the optometrist and the two restaurants at the opposite end of the row. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store must be the pharmacy and a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The optometrist and shoe store are next to each other. The pharmacy is at one end of the row and next to either optometrist or veterinarian. One of the restaurants is at the other end of the row. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
A: If there is a pharmacy at the left end, then there must be a restaurant at the right end. Therefore, the businesses on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store would be the pharmacy and a restaurant. This is a possible configuration.
B: If there is a pharmacy at the right end, then there must be a restaurant at the left end. Therefore, the businesses on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store would be the pharmacy and the toy store. However, this configuration violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
C: The two restaurants cannot be right next to each other, so this is not possible.
D: If there is a restaurant at the left end of the row, then there must be a pharmacy at the right end. Therefore, the businesses on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store would be a restaurant and the toy store. However, this configuration violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
E: If there is a veterinarian at the right end, then there must be a restaurant at the left end. Therefore, the businesses on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store would be a restaurant and the veterinarian. However, this configuration violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are seven spaces arranged in a straight row. 
  There are seven businesses: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist and shoe store take up two of the seven spaces and there are only five spaces left. 

Analysis:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. 
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the two restaurants cannot be next to the optometrist and shoe store. 
  Hence, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store must be the pharmacy and either a restaurant, the toy store, or the veterinarian.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are seven spaces in the shopping center, namely space 1 through space 7.
  Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist and the shoe store are together in a pair.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the possible arrangements of the businesses from left to right are:
- pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, X, X, restaurant, Y.
- Y, restaurant, X, X, shoe store, optometrist, pharmacy.
where X and Y represent a combination of any two businesses that are not the pharmacy, two restaurants, optometrist, shoe store, or toy store.
However, we know that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the only valid arrangement that satisfies all the constraints is:
- pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, toy store, X, restaurant, Y.
where X and Y represent a combination of any two businesses that are not the pharmacy, two restaurants, optometrist, shoe store, or toy store.
The businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store. Therefore, the answer is (B) the pharmacy and the toy store.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are only two possible arrangements:
1) ...Optometrist - Shoe Store...
2) ...Shoe Store - Optometrist...
The pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at opposite ends of the row.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Therefore, the only possible arrangement that fits the constraints is:
Pharmacy - ... - Restaurant - Optometrist - Shoe Store - ... - Restaurant/Veterinarian (depending on which restaurant is at the opposite end of the row)

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are two possibilities for their sequence: [optometrist, shoe store] or [shoe store, optometrist].
  - If [optometrist, shoe store] is the sequence, then the businesses immediately on either side of this pair are [pharmacy, restaurant] or [restaurant, pharmacy]. If [shoe store, optometrist] is the sequence, then the businesses immediately on either side of this pair are [restaurant, pharmacy] or [pharmacy, restaurant].
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row (spaces 1-7) in a shopping center.
  - There are seven businesses: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be: ?
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then we can assume that these two businesses occupy spaces 2 and 3 (in either order). Thus, the pharmacy cannot be in spaces 2 or 3 (since it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian). Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7. Since one of the restaurants must be at the opposite end of the row from the pharmacy, the restaurant that is not next to the pharmacy must be in space 7 or 1 (respectively). This means that the veterinarian cannot be in space 2 or 6 (since it cannot be next to the toy store), so it must be in space 4. Finally, the remaining businesses (the toy store and the other restaurant) must occupy spaces 5 and 6 (in either order). Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are the restaurant (in space 1 or 7) and the veterinarian (in space 4). Therefore, the answer is (E) a restaurant and the veterinarian.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  A shopping center has exactly seven spaces arranged in a straight row. 
  Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Processing:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are only two possible arrangements: 
  1) optometrist in space 2 and shoe store in space 3, or 
  2) optometrist in space 6 and shoe store in space 5
  In either case, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, 
  which means pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7. 
  If pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7, and the toy store cannot be in spaces 2, 3, or 4.
  If pharmacy is in space 7, then the restaurant must be in space 1, and the toy store cannot be in spaces 4, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, the only possible arrangement of businesses next to the optometrist and the shoe store is:
  optometrist, shoe store, pharmacy, restaurant, restaurant, toy store, veterinarian
  Thus, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and a restaurant.
  
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 spaces arranged in a straight row in the shopping center.
  - There are 7 businesses that will occupy these spaces: optometrist, pharmacy, 2 restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then there are only three possible configurations for the four businesses around this pair: pharmacy-vet, pharmacy-toy, or two restaurants.
  
Analysis: 
  - Since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, we have three possible configurations for the businesses around this pair:
    1. [optometrist][shoe store][pharmacy][???][???][restaurant][restaurant]
    2. [optometrist][shoe store][pharmacy][???][???][restaurant][toy store]
    3. [restaurant][restaurant][???][???][pharmacy][vet/optometrist][shoe store] 
  - In configuration 1, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, but neither of them can be placed immediately after the shoe store.
  - In configuration 2, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be after the restaurant. But then the two restaurants cannot be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - In configuration 3, the two restaurants are already next to each other, and the pharmacy is next to the optometrist.

Knowledge: 
  - Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday to Friday).
  - Each batch is made on a single day, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  
Analysis:

  - Since three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, the first batch of every kind of cookie is made on a different day.
  - The first batch of sugar cookies is not made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies can only be made on Monday or Friday, since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because each kind of cookie is made exactly three times a week, and the first two batches of oatmeal cookies are made on Monday and either Tuesday or Wednesday.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  - The second batch of peanut butter cookies can only be made on Tuesday, since the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on either Monday or Friday, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If the number of batches made on Friday is one, then the bakery made a total of 14 batches (3 x 2 x 5 - 1)

Analysis:

Knowledge:
- There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
- Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
- Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
- No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
- At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("D")  
If one batch is made on Friday, then it must be the third batch of some kind of cookie. 
Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Friday.
Therefore, the third batch must be either the third batch of oatmeal cookies or the third batch of peanut butter cookies.
If the third batch is the third batch of oatmeal cookies, then the first and second batches of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. This would mean that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday, the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday, and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday. However, this contradicts the fact that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
Therefore, the third batch must be the third batch of peanut butter cookies, which means the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. This leaves the first batch of oatmeal cookies to be made on Monday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies to be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies to be made on Thursday. This is consistent with all of the given conditions.
Therefore, the answer is D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter and sugar. Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then two batches must have been made on Wednesday and one on Thursday.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first and second batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on the same day.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Friday because the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
  - The third batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Friday because two batches have been made on Wednesday and one on Thursday.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - There are 3 batches of each kind of cookie made each week, one batch per day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  
Let's consider each option:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
     This option is not possible because the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.
  
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
     This option is not possible because the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday (the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies).
  
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
     This option is possible. If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday (since the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday), and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday (since the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday).
     
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
     This option is not possible because the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies, which is on Monday.
     
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
     This option is not possible because the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies, which is on Monday. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies each week.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the number of batches made on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday is 3.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we can infer that the third batch of sugar cookies will be made on Friday, which implies that the third batch of oatmeal cookies should be made on Thursday.
  Also, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies as no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
  
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday as there should be at least one batch of cookies made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday. Therefore, it cannot be made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies should be made on Friday. Therefore, it cannot be made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, and the second oatmeal batch is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, and the second sugar batch is made on Thursday. Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film and a western.
  Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  The list of movies shown on screen 2 must consist of a combination of two movies, one starting at 7 P.M. and the other starting at 9 P.M. 
  Since the romance cannot be shown on screen 2, the list does not include the romance movie.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, therefore they cannot both be in the list of movies shown on screen 2.
  The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  The list of movies on screen 2 cannot be "the sci-fi film, the mystery" because the horror film and the mystery cannot be shown on the same screen.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screen 2 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  
Elimination:
  If the western is shown on screen 2, it must be shown at 7 P.M. since it starts before the horror film. 
  Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, the only option left for the 7 P.M. movie on screen 2 is either the sci-fi film or the mystery. 
  However, the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, which eliminates option B.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.

A: the sci-fi film, the horror film - The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
B: the sci-fi film, the mystery - This could be an accurate list. 
C: the sci-fi film, the western - The western cannot be shown on screen 2 because the western begins at some time before the horror film does.
D: the western, the horror film - The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
E: the western, the mystery - This could be an accurate list.

Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The western starts before the horror movie.
  The sci-fi movie is not on screen 3.
  The romance is not on screen 2.
  The horror movie and the mystery are on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show movies at 7 PM and 9 PM each.
  Screen 3 shows one movie at 8 PM.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find the list of movies that cannot be shown in Screen 2.
  From the given conditions, we know that the Romance is not shown on Screen 2.
  Also, the Sci-fi movie is not shown on Screen 3.
  Therefore, the Sci-fi movie must be shown on either Screen 1 or Screen 2.
  According to the given conditions, Screen 1 and 2 show 2 movies each, one beginning at 7 PM and the other at 9 PM.
  Therefore, the Western movie must be shown at 7 PM or 9 PM on either Screen 1 or Screen 2.
  From the given condition, the horror movie is shown on a different screen than the mystery movie.
  
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film - This list could be accurate as per the given conditions.
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery - This list could be accurate as per the given conditions.
  C: the sci-fi film, the western - This list could be accurate if the Western movie is shown at 9 PM on Screen 2. Therefore, this is not the answer we are looking for.
  D: the western, the horror film - This list could be accurate if the Western movie is shown at 7 PM on Screen 2. Therefore, this is not the answer we are looking for.
  E: the western, the mystery - This list could be accurate if the Western movie is shown at 7 PM on Screen 2 and the Mystery movie is shown at 9 PM on Screen 2. Therefore, this is not the answer we are looking for.

Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  
Eliminating choices:
  - Choice A: The western cannot be shown before the horror film on screen 2 because there is only one movie before the other at 7 P.M. So, A is not accurate.
  - Choice B: There is no problem with this list. The mystery can be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M. and the horror film on screen 2 at 9 P.M. So, B can be accurate.
  - Choice C: The western cannot be shown on screen 2 because there is no romance in screen 2, and the western cannot be shown on screen 1 because there is already a movie at 7 P.M. So, C is not accurate.
  - Choice D: The western can be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1, and the horror film can be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2. So, D can be accurate.
  - Choice E: The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 because the mystery is already being shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2. So, E is not accurate.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:

  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  
Analysis:
  - Since screen 2 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., and there are five movies in total, two of them must be shown on screen 2.
  - The romance cannot be shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 2.
  - The western must be shown before the horror film, so it cannot be the second movie shown on screen 2.
  - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, so it must be one of the two movies shown on screen 2.
  
Action: Answer("E") - The western and the mystery cannot be shown on screen 2 together, so (E) cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - Screen 1 shows movies at 7 P.M. and 9 P.M.
  - Screen 2 shows movies at 7 P.M. and 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows one movie at 8 P.M.
Action: 
  Let's analyze the choices:
  - A: According to the given conditions, the horror movie cannot be on screen 2 if the mystery is on the other screen, so this choice is possible.
  - B: According to the given conditions, the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 2, so this choice is not possible.
  - C: According to the given conditions, the western cannot be on screen 2 if the horror film is on the other screen, so this choice is possible.
  - D: According to the given conditions, the western has to be before the horror film, so this choice is not possible.
  - E: According to the given conditions, the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so this choice is not possible.
  Therefore, the only choice that CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 is B. 
  Answer: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  - Since screen 2 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and one at 9 P.M., we need to find a pair of movies that could be shown on screen 2 based on the given conditions.
  - The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so the possible pairs of movies for screen 2 are: (1) sci-fi and horror, (2) sci-fi and mystery, and (3) western and horror or mystery.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film, so the western cannot be the second movie shown on screen 2.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it could be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 2.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
   - The list in choice E, "the western, the mystery," cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening. The reason is that the western must begin before the horror film does, but the mystery could be shown before or after the horror film. Therefore, we cannot determine the order of the movies in choice E.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are 5 movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  Since screen 2 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M., 
  and the romance is not shown on screen 2, we know that the romance is not one of the movies showing on screen 2.
  The horror and mystery films cannot be shown on the same screen, so only one of them can be on screen 2.
  The western is shown before the horror film, so it cannot be shown after the horror film, which means it must be one of the two movies on screen 2 starting at 7 P.M. 
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. Therefore, the sci-fi film must be one of the movies on screen 2 starting at 9 P.M. 
  So, the 7 P.M. movie on screen 2 must be the western and the 9 P.M. movie on screen 2 must be the sci-fi film.
  
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film - This is a possible list of movies on screen 2 because horror film is not playing at the same screen with the mystery.
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery - This is a possible list of movies on screen 2 because mystery is not playing at the same screen with the horror film.
  C: the sci-fi film, the western - This is a possible list of movies on screen 2 because the western is one of the movies on screen 2 starting at 7 P.M. and sci-fi film is one of the movies on screen 2 starting at 9 P.M.
  D: the western, the horror film - This is a possible list of movies on screen 2 because the western is one of the movies on screen 2 starting at 7 P.M. and horror film can be on screen 1 starting at 7 P.M. or on screen 2 starting at 9 P.M.
  E: the western, the mystery - This is NOT a possible list of movies on screen 2 because the mystery and horror films cannot be shown on the same screen.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, then the pharmacy is either in space 1 or 7 and one of the restaurants is either in space 1 or 7.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the other restaurant must be in space 4. However, this would mean that the shoe store is next to a restaurant, violating the rule that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the pharmacy is in space 7 and the other restaurant is in space 1.
  - Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist or the veterinarian is in space 6.
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, and the optometrist or the veterinarian is in space 6, then the toy store is in space 5.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and the restaurant is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian is in space 2.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
If the shoe store is in space 4, then we can deduce the following information:
  - The pharmacy cannot be in space 4, since it must be at one end of the row.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so neither of them can be in space 1 or space 7.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
  - Therefore, the veterinarian must be in either space 2 or space 6.
  - This means the pharmacy must be in space 1 and the optometrist must be in space 2, or the pharmacy must be in space 7 and the veterinarian must be in space 6.
  
So, the only option that must be true is that "the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian" (B).
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - A shopping center has 7 spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - A pharmacy and a restaurant must be at opposite ends of the row.
  - Two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Analysis:
  - If the shoe store is in space 4, then the only possible businesses that can be next to it are the two restaurants.
  - Hence, the pharmacy cannot be in space 3 nor in space 5, because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - Since the pharmacy cannot be in space 3 nor in space 5, it must occupy either space 1 or space 7.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 and one of the restaurants must be in space 7 (because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses) - in this case, the optometrist/veterinarian cannot be next to the pharmacy, so the pharmacy cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, and one of the restaurants must be in space 1.
  - The optometrist/veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6, but since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the optometrist must be in space 2 and the veterinarian in space 6.
  - Hence, the only choice that must be true is B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The shopping center has exactly seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Analysis: 
  - The pharmacy must be at the either end of the row, which means it cannot be in spaces 2 and 6 since these spaces are adjacent to space 1 and 7 respectively.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the possible locations for the pharmacy are either space 1 or 7. Without loss of generality, assume pharmacy is in space 1.
  - The restaurant must be at space 7. Therefore, the other restaurant must be located in space 3 or 5. Without loss of generality, assume restaurant 1 is in space 3.
  - The optometrist or the veterinarian must be next to the pharmacy. This means the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2. Without loss of generality, assume the optometrist is in space 2.
  - Now we have the following arrangement: 
    [Pharmacy, Optometrist, _, Restaurant 1, Shoe, _, Restaurant 2]
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, it must be in space 6.
  - The only space remaining is space 5, which must be occupied by the veterinarian.
  - Therefore, the following must be true:
    - The optometrist is next to a restaurant. (Option A is true)
    - The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. (Option B is false)
    - A restaurant is next to the toy store. (Option C is true)
    - The shoe store is next to the toy store. (Option D is true)
    - The shoe store is next to the veterinarian. (Option E is false)

Action: Answer("AD")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces numbered 1 through 7, arranged in a row.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and a restaurant at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is located in space 4.
  
Analysis:
  - Because the shoe store is in space 4, the businesses in spaces 3 and 5 must not be restaurants.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and a restaurant at the other end, so the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7 and a restaurant must be in the other.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is in space 1, the optometrist must be in space 2 and the veterinarian must be in space 8. If the pharmacy is in space 7, the optometrist must be in space 6 and the veterinarian must be in space 2.
  - If the veterinarian is in space 2, the toy store can't be in space 3 or 1 because it would be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 5 or 7.
  
Action: Answer("B") - The pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
  A: There are no clues to determine the location of the optometrist, so this choice is not necessarily true.
  B: The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the shoe store is in space 4, so the pharmacy cannot be next to the shoe store. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. This choice must be true.
  C: There are no clues to determine the location of the restaurant and the toy store, so this choice is not necessarily true.
  D: The shoe store is in space 4 and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so this choice is not true.
  E: The shoe store is in space 4 and the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so this choice is not true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - The shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - There are seven businesses: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Analysis:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means that there is only one possible place for the pharmacy and one possible place for the restaurant.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that there are only two possible arrangements for the restaurants: R _ _ R _ _ _ or _ _ _ R _ _ R.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. This means that the pharmacy can only be in space 1 or space 7, and the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. This means that the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")   
Explanation: Based on the constraints, the pharmacy can only be in space 1 or space 7, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. If the pharmacy were in space 1, then the optometrist or veterinarian would have to be in space 2, which is next to the shoe store. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the pharmacy must be in space 7 and the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 6. Therefore, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, which means that choice B is true.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then there are businesses on both side of space 4.
  
Analysis:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then there are businesses on both side of space 4. We can place the pharmacy, optometrist, and veterinarian in either of space 1, 2, and 3, and the two restaurants in either of space 5, 6, and 7. By using the given constraints, we can eliminate some of the choices.
  A: We do not know whether the optometrist is next to a restaurant or not.
  B: Since the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, which makes this choice true.
  C: We do not know whether a restaurant is next to the toy store or not.
  D: We know that the shoe store is in space 4, so it cannot be next to the toy store.
  E: We know that the shoe store is in space 4, so it cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row, numbered 1 to 7.
  - There are seven businesses that must be placed in the spaces - optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The shoe store is in space 4. 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. 
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. 
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the spaces 3 and 5 are occupied by other businesses. 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Therefore, it cannot be in space 3 and it must be in space 7. 
  One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, in space 1. 
  Therefore, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2. 
  Because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the veterinarian must be in space 3. 
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 5. 
  Therefore, the other restaurant must be in space 6.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the colors of those two rugs CANNOT be
Choices:
  A: forest and peach
  B: forest and yellow
  C: peach and turquoise
  D: peach and yellow
  E: turquoise and yellow
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The question is asking for a combination of two colors that cannot be used to make two solid rugs under the given rules.
  There are six colors available to weave the rugs: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. This means that if white is used in a rug, there must be at least three colors in that rug.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  If white is used in a multicolored rug, then there must be at least two additional colors, which will be used in the other two rugs. This means that a combination of forest and peach or forest and yellow can be used to make two solid rugs.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are six available colors of thread: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave three rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Solution: 
  Since there are exactly two solid rugs, the third rug must be multicolored.
  If white was one of the colors used in a solid rug, then two other colors would have to be used, making it impossible to have a third multicolored rug.
  Therefore, white cannot be used in any of the solid rugs.
  Olive requires peach to be included, and peach cannot be used with yellow in a rug, so olive cannot be used in a solid rug with yellow.
  This eliminates choices (B) and (D).
  Turquoise cannot be used with forest or peach, so it cannot be used in a solid rug with either of those colors.
  This eliminates choice (C).
  Therefore, the only remaining choice is (A): forest and peach.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The question mentions that there are six colors of thread available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. If there are exactly two solid rugs, that means three of the rugs will be multicolored. The rules for weaving the rugs are also given.
A: If forest and peach are used in the same solid rug, we cannot use both of them in any other rug. This would mean that we cannot have three multicolored rugs. Hence, this combination is not possible.
B: If forest and yellow are used in the same solid rug, we cannot use both of them in any other rug. This would mean that we cannot have three multicolored rugs. Hence, this combination is not possible.
C: If peach and turquoise are used in the same solid rug, we cannot use both of them in any other rug. This would mean that we cannot have three multicolored rugs. Hence, this combination is not possible.
D: This combination is possible. We can have a solid rug with peach and a solid rug with yellow. Then we can have three multicolored rugs using the remaining colors.
E: If turquoise and yellow are used in the same solid rug, we cannot use both of them in any other rug. This would mean that we cannot have three multicolored rugs. Hence, this combination is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are six colors of thread available -- forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Five colors will be used to weave the three rugs. 
  Each color will be used for only one rug. 
  In any rug with white, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug with olive, peach is also used. 
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. 
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  There are exactly two solid rugs.
  
Analysis: 
  Among the given choices, we need to find the two colors that cannot be used for both solid rugs. 
  Since there are exactly two solid rugs, all the rules apply to these two solid rugs. 
  Let's consider choice A - If we use forest and peach in the solid rugs, no other rug can use these colors. 
  Choice B - If we use forest and yellow, no other rug can use these colors. 
  Choice C - peach and turquoise cannot be used together in any rug. 
  Choice D - peach and yellow cannot be used together in any rug. 
  Choice E - turquoise and yellow cannot be used together in any rug. 
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, if there are exactly two solid rugs, the colors of those two rugs cannot be peach and turquoise.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  We need to find two colors that cannot be used together in a solid rug, given the constraints of the problem.
  There are six colors available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Each solid rug will be woven in a single color.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug that uses three colors.
  We need to consider the constraints that apply to each of the given pairs of colors.
  
Analysis:
  Let's consider each pair of colors:
  - A: forest and peach: We can use these colors together in a rug, so they could both be used in one of the solid rugs.
  - B: forest and yellow: We can use these colors together in a rug, so they could both be used in one of the solid rugs.
  - C: peach and turquoise: We cannot use these colors together in a rug, so they cannot both be used in a solid rug.
  - D: peach and yellow: We cannot use these colors together in a rug, so they cannot both be used in a solid rug.
  - E: turquoise and yellow: We can use these colors together in a rug, so they could both be used in one of the solid rugs.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  We are looking for a pair of colors that CANNOT be used together in a pair of solid rugs.
  The rules are:
    - Each color can only be used once.
    - White must be used with two other colors in a rug.
    - Olive and peach must be used together in a rug.
    - Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
    - Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
    - Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, and each solid rug uses only one color, then a total of two colors will be used in solid rugs. Thus, three colors will be used in multicolored rugs.
  The colors that cannot be used together in a pair of solid rugs are the ones that, when combined with any other color available, do not create a valid combination of colors for a multicolored rug.
  
Analysis:
  Let's examine each option to see if it could be a pair of colors that cannot be used together in a pair of solid rugs:
  - Option A: forest and peach
    - If forest and peach are used in the solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must use olive, turquoise, white, and yellow.
    - These five colors can be combined in several valid ways to create a multicolored rug.
    - Therefore, A is not correct.
  - Option B: forest and yellow
    - If forest and yellow are used in the solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must use olive, peach, turquoise, and white.
    - These four colors cannot be combined in a valid way to create a multicolored rug, since olive and peach must be used together.
    - Therefore, B is correct.
  - Option C: peach and turquoise
    - If peach and turquoise are used in the solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must use olive, forest, white, and yellow.
    - These five colors can be combined in several valid ways to create a multicolored rug.
    - Therefore, C is not correct.
  - Option D: peach and yellow
    - If peach and yellow are used in the solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must use olive, forest, turquoise, and white.
    - These four colors cannot be combined in a valid way to create a multicolored rug, since forest and turquoise cannot be used together.
    - Therefore, D is correct.
  - Option E: turquoise and yellow
    - If turquoise and yellow are used in the solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must use olive, forest, peach, and white.
    - These four colors cannot be combined in a valid way to create a multicolored rug, since olive and peach must be used together.
    - Therefore, E is not correct.
    
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The rules for weaving the rugs are:
  - Exactly 5 colors of thread will be used.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  - There are exactly two solid rugs.
  
For the solid rugs, only one color is used in each rug. Therefore, if there are exactly two solid rugs then at most two colors will be used. 

- If forest and peach were used in the solid rugs, two other colors would need to be used in the multicolored rug that contains white. This would require at least five colors in total, which is not possible.
- If forest and yellow were used in the solid rugs, two other colors would need to be used in the multicolored rug that contains white. This would require at least five colors in total, which is not possible.
- If peach and turquoise were used in the solid rugs, then forest, olive, and yellow would be used in the multicolored rug that contains white. This satisfies all of the rules.
- If peach and yellow were used in the solid rugs, then forest, olive, and turquoise would be used in the multicolored rug that contains white. This satisfies all of the rules.
- If turquoise and yellow were used in the solid rugs, then forest, olive, and peach would be used in the multicolored rug that contains white. This satisfies all of the rules.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are six colors of thread available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Each rug can only use five colors.
  Each color can only be used in one rug.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  There are exactly two solid rugs.
  
Analysis: 
  Since there are only two solid rugs, the other rug must be multicolored.
  If forest is used for a solid rug, it cannot be used with peach in a multicolored rug because of the rule that Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  If yellow is used for a solid rug, it cannot be used with peach in a multicolored rug because of the rule that Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  This eliminates options B and D.
  If peach is used for a solid rug, it cannot be used with turquoise in a multicolored rug because of the rule that Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  This eliminates option C.
  If turquoise is used for a solid rug, it cannot be used with peach in a multicolored rug because of the rule that Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  This eliminates option E.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We are given six colors - forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  We need to weave three rugs out of these colors.
  Each rug will have exactly 5 colors out of these 6 colors.
  Each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. 
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. 
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. 
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  If peach is used in one of the solid rugs, then we cannot use peach in the multicolored rug. So, we need to choose four colors from the remaining five colors.
  If yellow is used in one of the solid rugs, then we cannot use yellow in the multicolored rug. So, we need to choose four colors from the remaining five colors.
  So, if there are exactly two solid rugs, then the colors of those two rugs cannot be forest and peach, forest and yellow, peach and turquoise, or turquoise and yellow because in each of these cases we will be forced to use either peach or yellow in the multicolored rug, violating the rules. Thus, the answer is D, peach and yellow.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 colors of thread available to weave the rugs: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly 5 of these colors will be used to weave the 3 rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis: 
  Since there are exactly 5 colors used in the 3 rugs, then there can be at most one solid-colored rug, since each color can only be used once. If there are exactly two solid-colored rugs, then each of those rugs must use two of the same colors, along with one additional color. The only pairs of colors that cannot be used together are forest and turquoise, peach and turquoise, and peach and yellow. Therefore, the colors of the two solid-colored rugs cannot be forest and peach, forest and yellow, or peach and yellow since each of these pairs contains a color that cannot be used with another color.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: Verma could be the project leader if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have 3 members, and 1 of them will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a member if one of them is the leader.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a member, then Ruiz and Verma cannot be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Wells is not a member of the project. This is because Wells cannot be a project member if Ruiz and Verma are not project members. So, exactly two of the members are selected from Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, and Xue. If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be a member. If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then we have to select three members from Quinn, Ruiz, and Xue, which is impossible. Therefore, Smith must be a project member. 
  
  If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then we have to select three members from Quinn, Ruiz, Taylor, and Verma. However, Wells cannot be a member if Verma is not a member, and if Wells is not a member, then we can only select two members from Quinn, Ruiz, Taylor, and Verma. Therefore, either Smith or Xue must be a member. 
  
  If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then we have to select three members from Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, and Xue. However, if Quinn or Ruiz is a member, then one of them must be the leader, which is not possible because they cannot be members unless they are the leader. Therefore, Taylor must be a member.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be one of the three selected workers.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the leader, she must be one of the three selected workers. Therefore, Wells cannot be selected because neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is included. That means Ruiz must be the leader, with Quinn also a member. Smith must be the third member, with Taylor also included because of Smith. Therefore, Verma could be the project leader only if Smith is not a project member.
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Verma cannot be the leader.
  B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Quinn, Smith, or Verma must be the leader.
  C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma cannot be the leader.
  D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, it is still possible that Smith, Taylor, and Wells are selected, so Verma cannot be the leader.
  E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then it is impossible to select Smith, Taylor, and Wells at the same time, so Verma could be the leader.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members.
  Exactly one of the three members will be the project leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then they must be the leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then Ruiz and Verma cannot be selected.

Working through the answer choices:
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then it is impossible for Verma to be the project leader, since Quinn or Ruiz must be the leader if they are selected.
  B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then it is possible for Verma to be the project leader. Quinn or Smith could be the leader, and Verma could be one of the members.
  C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then it is impossible for Verma to be a member of the project, since Smith and Taylor are a required pair.
  D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then it is possible for Verma to be the project leader. Wells could be a member of the project, and Quinn or Ruiz could be the other member and the leader.
  E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then it is impossible for Verma to be a member of the project, since Ruiz and Verma cannot be selected if Wells is selected.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Quinn or Ruiz are project members, they must lead the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Exactly one project member will be the project leader.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then Verma must be a project member, but neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members if Wells is a project member. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member, which means Smith and Taylor must be project members since they are a pair. This eliminates choices A, B, and D. We can also eliminate choice E, because if Taylor is not selected, then Smith cannot be selected, and vice versa. Therefore, the only remaining option is choice C, which says that neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member since they can only be project members if they are leading the project. If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member. If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be. Therefore, the possibilities are Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, and Xue. We need to select three from these five workers, one of whom will be the project leader.
  
A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then we have to select 3 people from the group consisting of Ruiz, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue. Wells cannot be selected because neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected if Wells is selected. So, we are left with the group consisting of Ruiz, Taylor, and Xue. None of these can be the project leader since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then we have to select 3 people from the group consisting of Quinn, Smith, Verma, Wells, and Xue. Since Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member. If Smith is not selected, then Taylor cannot be a project member. So, we are left with the group consisting of Verma, Wells, and Xue. None of these can be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then we have to select 3 people from the group consisting of Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue. Since Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member. If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then we are left with the group consisting of Verma, Wells, and Xue. None of these can be the project leader since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then we have to select 3 people from the group consisting of Quinn, Ruiz, Taylor, Verma, and Wells. Since Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member. If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then we are left with the group consisting of Verma, Taylor, and Wells. Neither Taylor nor Wells can be the project leader since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then we have to select 3 people from the group consisting of Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Verma, and Xue. Since Verma is the project leader, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member. If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then we are left with the group consisting of Smith, Verma, and Xue. None of these can be the project leader since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three workers will be selected for the project, and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be project members if they lead the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, Ruiz and Verma can not be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then the other two selected workers cannot be both Ruiz and Quinn. If either Ruiz or Quinn is selected, they must be the project leader. This means that Smith and Taylor must be selected together. Also, if Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Thus, we can eliminate options A, B, and D because they allow for one of the excluded combinations of workers. Option C is also incorrect because it does not satisfy the condition that if Verma is a project leader, either Ruiz or Quinn must be selected. Therefore, the answer is E, which satisfies all the given conditions. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members and one of them will be project leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then he must be the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, then exactly two other workers will be selected as project members. This means that two of the following three workers must be selected: Ruiz, Smith, and Taylor. Additionally, if Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Taylor can be a project member. This leaves Smith as the only possible choice for the third project member if Wells is not selected. If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be a project member. This narrows the choices down to either Quinn or Smith as the project leader.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three workers will be selected for the project.
  - Exactly one of the three selected will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader if they are part of the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Let's check each choice:
A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  - If neither Quinn nor Smith are selected, then neither of the constraints that involve them matter.
  - We still have to check if Verma can be the project leader with the other constraints.
  - This choice cannot be the answer because it doesn't give us enough information to determine if Verma could be the project leader.
B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  - If neither Ruiz nor Taylor are selected, then none of the constraints that involve them matter.
  - We still have to check if Verma can be the project leader with the other constraints.
  - This choice cannot be the answer because it doesn't give us enough information to determine if Verma could be the project leader.
C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  - If neither Smith nor Taylor are selected, then the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be, is fulfilled.
  - We still have to check if Verma can be the project leader with the other constraints.
  - This choice cannot be the answer because it doesn't give us enough information to determine if Verma could be the project leader.
D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  - If neither Smith nor Xue are selected, then the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be, is fulfilled.
  - We still have to check if Verma can be the project leader with the other constraints.
  - This choice cannot be the answer because it doesn't give us enough information to determine if Verma could be the project leader.
E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
  - If neither Taylor nor Wells are selected, then the constraint that if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, is fulfilled.
  - We still have to check if Verma can be the project leader with the other constraints.
  - If Verma is selected along with Quinn and Smith, then Quinn would be the project leader because Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader if they are part of the project.
  - This choice cannot be the answer because Verma cannot be the project leader in this case.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above") 
None of the choices give us enough information to determine if Verma could be the project leader.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three of the seven workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Elimination:
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, if Smith is not selected, Taylor is not selected as well.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, if Verma is selected, Wells cannot be selected.

Analysis:
  Suppose Verma is the project leader. Then, Verma, Wells, and one more person will be selected. Since Wells is already selected, the last project member must be someone who is not Ruiz, Smith, or Taylor. Therefore, the only option that works is E, where neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Elimination:
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. So, if Smith is not selected, Taylor cannot be the project leader. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader. We can eliminate options C and D.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. So, if Verma is selected, Wells cannot be a project member. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader if Wells is selected. We can eliminate option E.
  
Analysis: 
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. So, there are only two possibilities: 
    Possibility 1: Quinn and Ruiz are selected, and one of them is the project leader.
    Possibility 2: One of Quinn or Ruiz is selected and Smith and Taylor are selected as the other two members. In this case, Smith or Taylor must be the project leader.

Action: Answer("B")  
  If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, it leaves Quinn, Smith, Verma, Wells, and Xue. If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. If Wells is selected, Verma cannot be a project member. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is for Verma to be selected along with Quinn and Xue, with Verma being the project leader. Therefore, Verma could be the project leader if neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.

Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown in the afternoon.
  C: L is shown in the evening.
  D: M is shown in the morning.
  E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show 7 houses during a single day as follows:

  Morning: First and Second houses
  Afternoon: Third, Fourth and Fifth houses.
  Evening: Sixth and Seventh houses.

  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

A: K cannot be shown in the morning and cannot be shown in the evening since J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon.
B: L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Since K is shown in the afternoon, L must also be shown in the afternoon, but we don't know if it will be the third, fourth, or fifth house shown in the afternoon.
C: J must be shown in the evening, and L must be shown after K and before M. Therefore, L cannot be shown in the evening. Therefore, it must be shown in the afternoon.
D: M cannot be shown in the morning. It has to be shown either in the afternoon or evening.
E: L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, M cannot be shown in the morning. It has to be shown either in the afternoon or evening.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show 7 houses in total to a prospective buyer.
  The first and second houses will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J will be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analyzing the Choices:
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning, and J is shown in the evening. Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. So, this choice cannot be true.
  B: L must be shown after K and before M. We know K cannot be shown in the morning, and L cannot be shown in the morning, so L and K must be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, this choice could be true.
  C: J is shown in the evening, and L must be shown after K and before M. We know K cannot be shown in the morning, and L cannot be shown in the morning, so L and K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. Therefore, this choice could be true.
  D: M cannot be shown in the morning because the third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
  E: M must be shown after L, which will be shown in the afternoon or evening. Therefore, this choice could be true.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses, the first and second in the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth in the afternoon, and the sixth and seventh in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown after K and before M.
  
Elimination:
  A: K cannot be shown in the evening, so this choice is not possible.
  B: L can be shown in the afternoon, but there's no rule that says it must be shown in the afternoon, so this choice is not necessarily true.
  C: J must be shown in the evening, and L must be shown after K and before M. Thus, L must be shown in the evening to satisfy both of these rules. Therefore, this choice must be true.
  D: M cannot be shown in the morning, so this choice is not possible.
  E: L must be shown after K and before M. Since L is shown in either the morning or the afternoon, and M is shown in the afternoon or evening, there is no definitive time when M must be shown. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show houses in the following order: two houses in the morning, three houses in the afternoon, and two houses in the evening.
  J will be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  Since K cannot be shown in the morning, it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L cannot be shown in the morning, and it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the first two houses to be shown in the morning must be N and O, since K cannot be shown in the morning.
  The order of houses shown in the afternoon must be KLM, since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The last two houses to be shown in the evening must be JP, since J must be shown in the evening.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
  Therefore, M is shown in the afternoon.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses in total throughout the day; two in the morning, three in the afternoon, and two in the evening.
  House J must be shown in the evening.
  House K cannot be shown in the morning.
  House L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Elimination:
  A. K cannot be shown in the evening since only J is shown in the evening. Therefore, it's false.
  B. L must be shown between K and M, thus it cannot be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, it's false.
  C. House J must be shown in the evening while L must be shown between K and M. Therefore, it must be shown in the evening. Thus, it's true.
  D. M cannot be shown in the morning since it's in between the afternoon and evening houses. Therefore, it's false.
  E. House L must be shown between K and M. Thus, M must be shown after L. Therefore, it's false.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:

Elimination:
  A: K cannot be shown in the evening.
  B: L can be shown in the afternoon, but it is not required to be.
  C: J must be shown in the evening, so L cannot be shown after J.
  D: M cannot be shown in the morning.
  E: L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:

  3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  4. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.

Using the given rules and applying them to the choices:
  A: The first two houses to be shown are in the morning, so K cannot be shown in the evening. Therefore, A is false.
  B: The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown are in the afternoon, so L can be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, B could be true.
  C: J is shown in the evening, and L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, C could be true.
  D: M is shown in the morning. However, we know that J must be shown in the evening, so M cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, D is false.
  E: M is shown in the afternoon. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so E could be true.

Action: Answer("B") or Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day, according to the following schedule:
  - The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  - The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  - The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Analysis:
  J cannot be shown in the morning or in the afternoon because it must be shown in the evening. Therefore, J is either the sixth house or the seventh house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K is either the third, fourth, or fifth house to be shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L is either the fourth or the fifth house to be shown.
  Based on the above reasoning, we can determine the following three facts:
  1. J is either the sixth or the seventh house to be shown.
  2. K is either the third, fourth, or fifth house to be shown.
  3. L is either the fourth or the fifth house to be shown.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The realtor has to show seven houses, two in the morning, three in the afternoon, and two in the evening. J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown after K and before M.
A: K cannot be shown in the morning, and J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, K cannot be shown in the evening.
B: L must be shown after K and before M. If L is shown in the afternoon, K must be shown in the morning and M in the evening; however, K cannot be shown in the morning, so this option is not possible.
C: L must be shown after K and before M. If L is shown in the evening, K must be shown in the morning and M in the afternoon; however, K cannot be shown in the morning, so this option is not possible.
D: M must be shown after L, and there are no houses to show after M, so M cannot be shown in the morning.
E: L must be shown after K, and there are no houses to show after M, so M must be shown in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses: J, K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  The first two houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  Since J must be shown in the evening, it is not possible for K to be shown in the evening, so option A is false.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and before M is shown. Since K cannot be shown in the morning and L must be shown at some time after K is shown, L must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  Since L must be shown before M is shown and M is shown in the afternoon, L must be shown in the afternoon.
  Therefore, the answer is option B: L is shown in the afternoon.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo will also have to be assigned to an ambassadorship. Thus, Jaramillo cannot be the only ambassador not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, and Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia since Novetzke is not available.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, and Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Novetzke and Landon must be assigned to the other two ambassadorships. But Landon cannot be assigned to Zambia since Kayne is already assigned to Yemen. Thus, Ong must be assigned to Zambia.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then we know that Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships. Additionally, if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships. However, if Jaramillo is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships, then we cannot be sure about the assignment of Kayne. Therefore, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, which means that the answer is D.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen:
    If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
    If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
    Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
    If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
    
  A: It is possible that Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, but it is not a necessary conclusion from the given information.
  B: It is possible that Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, but it is not a necessary conclusion from the given information.
  C: It is not possible for Ong to be assigned as ambassador to Zambia, because if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  D: It is not a necessary conclusion from the given information that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, because it is possible that Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela and Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  E: It is not a necessary conclusion from the given information that Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, because it is possible that Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela or Zambia.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador, then Kayne must also be assigned as ambassador.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.

Reasoning:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned as ambassador to any of the countries. Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela or Zambia. However, if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador, then Kayne must also be assigned as ambassador, which would violate the constraint that Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to one of the countries. Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which would contradict the initial assumption. Therefore, Ong must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it must be to Zambia, which is consistent with the constraints. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then either Jaramillo or Novetzke can be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, but not both. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
A) If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, because if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, A is not true.
B) If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Landon cannot be assigned as ambassador to Zambia, because if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, B is not true.
C) If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, we don't know anything about Ong's assignment. Therefore, C is not necessarily true.
D) If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then either Jaramillo or Novetzke can be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, but not both. Jaramillo might or might not be assigned to an ambassadorship, so D is not necessarily true.
E) If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, we don't know anything about Ong's assignment. Therefore, E is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
- If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Jaramillo must also be assigned as ambassador to one of the countries. 
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Action: Answer("B") 

If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must also be assigned as ambassador to one of the countries. Since Landon is assigned to Zambia, and Jaramillo and Novetzke are not assigned to Yemen, Venezuela, or Zambia, there are only two countries left where Jaramillo can be assigned: Venezuela and Yemen. However, we know that if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, and Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Thus, B is true and the answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships since it is given that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo cannot be assigned to Venezuela since if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne has to be assigned as well. Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- Kayne or Novetzke is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Action: Answer("B")

If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to Yemen. This means Novetzke must be assigned either to Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, this means that Jaramillo cannot be assigned to Venezuela, because in that case there would be no ambassadorship left for Kayne to fill. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. So, it must be true that Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Thus, the correct answer is B.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke can't be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  - If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to another country.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne can't be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Analysis:
  - If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke can't be assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, Novetzke will not be assigned as ambassador to any country.
  - If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to another country. Therefore, the only possibility is that Jaramillo will be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne can't be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. However, we know that Kayne is assigned to Yemen, so Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. However, we do not know if Landon will be assigned as ambassador to any country.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Kayne cannot be assigned to Venezuela or Zambia because Jaramillo and Landon are not assigned to Yemen.
- If Kayne is assigned to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
- If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.

Action: 
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships. Thus, Jaramillo must be assigned to Venezuela because if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Knowledge: Each member of the band performs exactly one solo during the concert. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
 
Solutions: 
- Guitarist: Cannot perform the fourth solo.
- Percussionist: Must perform before the keyboard player.
- Keyboard player: Must perform after the violinist and before the guitarist.
- Saxophonist: Must perform after the percussionist or the trumpeter.
- Trumpeter: Can perform before the saxophonist.
- Violinist: Does not have any specific restrictions.

If the saxophonist performs after the percussionist, then the only possible order for the third solo would be either violinist- saxophonist- keyboard player or trumpet-saxophonist-keyboard player. Therefore, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the guitarist, which is not one of the options. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Each of the six members performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  To perform the third solo, the saxophonist must perform after the first and second solos, which must be performed by two of the following: percussionist, trumpeter, violinist.
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the percussionist cannot perform the third solo.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist, so the violinist cannot perform the third solo.
  The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, so one of them must perform the first solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist performs either the second or the third solo.
  From the above, we see that the saxophonist can perform the third solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter performs the first solo, and the guitarist performs the second or the third solo.
  Therefore, the keyboard player cannot perform the third solo. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Solution:
  - From the given information, we can conclude that the guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, and the keyboard player should perform a solo after the violinist but before the guitarist.
  - Also, the percussionist must perform a solo before the keyboard player.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  - The only possibility to satisfy these conditions and constraints is that the violinist performs the first solo, followed by the percussionist, the trumpeter, the saxophonist, the keyboard player, and then the guitarist.
  - Therefore, the member who cannot perform the third solo is the saxophonist.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Six-member band gives a concert and each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  We know that the guitarist cannot be the fourth. So, either the guitarist is the first, second, or third, or one of the remaining four musicians performs before the guitarist.
  We also know that the percussionist performs before the keyboard player. Therefore, the violinist must perform before the keyboard player. 
  Also, The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter does, but not both. Thus, the saxophonist cannot perform 3rd solo as the percussionist and trumpeter are the only options for performing the first two solos. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - The first solo can be performed by any member of the band.
  - The second solo can be performed by either the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  - The third solo can be performed by any member of the band except for the guitarist (due to the first restriction), the percussionist (because it performs earlier than the keyboard player), or the saxophonist (because it has to perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both).
  - This leaves us with the keyboard player and the violinist as possible candidates for the third solo.
  - However, the keyboard player cannot perform the third solo after the guitarist (due to the second restriction).
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

We know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so they perform either the first, second, or third solo. 

If the guitarist performs the first solo, then the percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player, the violinist performs a solo before the keyboard player, and the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter. This means the saxophonist will perform a solo after the percussionist, who has already performed, so the saxophonist can only perform a solo after the trumpeter. But this is impossible because the saxophonist would have to perform after the fourth solo, which is not possible.

If the guitarist performs the second solo, then the percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player, the violinist performs a solo before the keyboard player, and the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter. This means the saxophonist will perform a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter. If the percussionist performs their solo before the trumpet player, then the saxophonist can perform after the percussionist. But in this case, the keyboard player would have to perform after the guitarist and before the percussionist, which is not allowed. Therefore, the percussionist performs after the keyboard player, which means the saxophonist performs after the trumpet player. This scenario works.

If the guitarist performs the third solo, then the percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player, the violinist performs a solo before the keyboard player, and the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter. This means the saxophonist will perform a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter. If the percussionist performs their solo before the trumpet player, then the saxophonist can perform after the percussionist. But in this case, the keyboard player would have to perform after the guitarist and before the percussionist, which is not allowed. Therefore, the percussionist performs after the keyboard player, which means the saxophonist performs after the trumpet player. This scenario works.

Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or E because each of those performers can perform the third solo. The answer is D, the trumpeter. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are six solos performed by the members of the band, each performing exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Approach:
  We need to determine which member of the band cannot perform the third solo. By assessing the given information, we can try to place the members in order of their solos.

Solution:
  Let us assume that the order of solos has been determined, starting with the first. We can use the given information to eliminate possible orders of solos until there is only one possible order.
  
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
- The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the keyboard player must perform the last solo. However, this is not possible since the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the second or third solo.
- The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. If the keyboard player performs the second solo, then the order of solos must be violinist, keyboard player, percussionist, trumpeter, guitarist, saxophonist. This satisfies all of the given conditions except for the saxophonist, who cannot perform a solo after the percussionist and before the guitarist. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform the fourth solo.
- The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. If the saxophonist performs the second solo, then the order of solos must be percussionist, saxophonist, violinist, keyboard player, guitarist, trumpeter. This satisfies all of the given conditions. Therefore, the saxophonist can perform at the second solo.
- Now, the possible members to perform the third solo are the percussionist, the violinist, and the trumpeter. 
- The violinist already performed the first solo, so he cannot perform the third solo. 
- The percussionist cannot perform the third solo because the keyboard player must perform a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does, and the keyboard player must perform the fourth solo.
- Therefore the only possible answer is D: trumpeter. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  Let's suppose that the saxophonist performs the third solo. Since the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both, then either the percussionist or the trumpeter must perform the second solo. However, the keyboard player must perform a solo at some time after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. Then, the keyboard player cannot perform the fourth solo and the last solo must be performed by the guitarist. Since there are no restrictions on the first solo, the violinist can perform the first solo. Therefore, we have the following order of solos: violinist, percussionist or trumpeter, saxophonist, keyboard player, and guitarist. This means that the saxophonist can perform the third solo. Thus, choice C cannot be the answer and the correct answer is None of the Above.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six members in the band, and each member performs exactly one solo.
  2. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  3. The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  4. The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  5. The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
To determine who cannot perform the third solo, we need to determine who must perform the third solo based on the given restrictions. 

From restriction 2, we know that the percussionist performs before the keyboard player. 

From restriction 3, we know that the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist. So, the guitarist must perform after the keyboard player.

From restriction 5, we know that the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. This means that the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist or the trumpeter or even after both.

Therefore, the order of performances must be violinist, percussionist, saxophonist, [none of the above], keyboard player, guitarist.

The only option for the third solo that is not in this order is D: trumpeter. Therefore, the answer is D. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Six members are there in the band.
- Each member performs exactly one solo.
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
- The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
- The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
- The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter performs, but not both.

Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation:
Let's say the player who performs third is the guitarist. Then the first three players would be percussionist, saxophonist and violinist in some order. Then the keyboard player must perform before the guitarist, which is impossible because the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Hence the guitarist cannot perform third number solo. Therefore, the trumpeter must perform the third number solo. So, they perform in the following order: percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist, keyboard player, guitarist. Thus, the player who cannot perform the third solo is the trumpeter. The answer is D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the sixth audition?
Choices:
  A: Kammer's audition
  B: Lugo's audition
  C: Trillo's audition
  D: Waite's audition
  E: Zinn's audition
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are six singers to audition: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  We know that Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions; since the fifth audition must be recorded, Waite's audition cannot be the fifth or sixth audition.
  We also know that Kammer's audition must occur before Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must occur before Yoshida's audition.
  Kammer's and Lugo's auditions must be recorded. 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
  Therefore, the possible order of auditions could be Lugo, Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida. 
  Trillo's audition could be the sixth audition as it occurs after Kammer's and Zinn's auditions and before Yoshida's.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The auditions are for six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded.
  - The other four auditions will not be recorded.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Using the conditions, we can determine the order of the auditions as follows:
1. Waite (not recorded)
2. Kammer (recorded)
3. Trillo (not recorded)
4. Zinn (not recorded)
5. Yoshida (recorded)
6. ?
Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, and Waite's audition is the first one, we know that Waite's audition cannot be the fourth one. Since the fifth audition must be recorded, we know that Yoshida's audition must be the fifth one. 
This means that the only option left for the sixth audition is Lugo's audition (which must be the second recorded audition). 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded. The other four will not be.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Let's evaluate each option:
  - Option A: Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Option B: Lugo's audition will be recorded, and the fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - Option C: Trillo's audition must come after Kammer's audition.
  - Option D: Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Option E: Zinn's audition must come before Yoshida's audition.

None of the options seems to violate the given conditions. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the auditions is:
  * Waite
  * Kammer
  * Trillo
  * [cannot be recorded]
  * Lugo
  * Yoshida
  * Zinn
  A: Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  B: Lugo's audition must be recorded and must occur after the fourth audition, so Lugo's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  C: Trillo's audition must occur after Kammer's audition, so Trillo's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  D: Waite's audition must occur earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  E: Zinn's audition must occur earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition can be the sixth audition.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  From the condition that the fourth audition cannot be recorded, we can infer that the fourth audition must be either Kammer's audition or Lugo's audition, since they are the only two auditions that are recorded.
  From the condition that the fifth audition must be recorded, we can infer that the fifth audition is either Kammer's audition or Lugo's audition.
  From the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, we can infer that Waite's audition must be the first or the second audition.
  From the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, we can infer that Kammer's audition must be the first or the second audition, and Trillo's audition must be the third or the fourth audition.
  From the condition that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, we can infer that Zinn's audition must be the first, the second, or the third audition, and Yoshida's audition must be the fifth or the sixth audition.
  
Solution:
  If Kammer's audition is the first or the second audition, then Trillo's audition must be the third or the fourth audition, which means that either Lugo's audition or Waite's audition must be the sixth audition, but we know that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so it cannot be the sixth audition. Therefore, Kammer's audition cannot be the first or the second audition.
  If Lugo's audition is the first or the second audition, then Kammer's audition must be the third or the fourth audition, which means that either Waite's audition or Trillo's audition must be the sixth audition. However, we know that Trillo's audition cannot be the sixth audition, since the fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, the only option left is that Waite's audition is the sixth audition.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  Based on the given conditions, we can determine the order of the first five auditions: 
  1. Waite
  2. Kammer (recorded)
  3. Trillo 
  4. Zinn 
  5. Lugo (recorded)
  According to the conditions given, the sixth audition must take place after the fifth audition; therefore, it cannot be Kammer's or Lugo's audition because they are already scheduled for earlier auditions. It also cannot be Trillo's audition because it would be the fourth audition and cannot be recorded. Waite's audition is already scheduled as the first audition, so the only option available for the sixth audition is Zinn's audition.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analysis:
  If the fifth audition must be recorded, then the only possible auditions that could be recorded are Kammer's and Lugo's. Therefore, we know that either Kammer's or Lugo's audition will be the fifth audition. Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, we know that the fourth audition must be either Trillo's, Waite's, or Zinn's. Since Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, we know that Waite's audition cannot be the fourth audition. Therefore, the fourth audition must be either Trillo's or Zinn's. However, we also know that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, and Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, the only possibility for the sixth audition is Trillo's audition.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analyzing each option:
  A: Kammer's audition must happen before Trillo's, so Kammer's cannot be the sixth audition.
  B: Lugo's audition must be recorded, so it cannot be the sixth audition.
  C: The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so Trillo's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  D: Waite's audition cannot be the sixth, since it must happen before the two recorded auditions.
  E: Zinn's audition can be the sixth audition, as long as Yoshida's audition happens before it, which is allowed by the conditions.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it has to be either the third or the sixth audition. 
The fifth audition must be recorded.
Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
 
Analysis: 
If Waite's audition goes first, then the order will be Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Zinn, and Yoshida. The fourth audition can only be Lugo's audition, which means Trillo's audition must be the third audition, and Kammer's audition must be the second audition. Thus, the only remaining audition is Waite's audition, which will be the sixth audition. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Elimination:
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, meaning Waite's audition must be one of the first three. 
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, meaning Kammer's audition must also be one of the first three.
  Given that Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded, and the fourth audition cannot be recorded, the fourth audition must be either Trillo's audition, Waite's audition, or Zinn's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, meaning Zinn's audition cannot be the last audition.

Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, Trillo's audition could be the sixth audition.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two per section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports)
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section
  - No Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then we know that the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes, Gagnon, or Hue. We also know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, either Gagnon or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section.

If Gagnon has a photograph in the Metro section, then it can't have any photograph in the Sports section because of the constraint. Therefore, the only possibility for the two photographs in the Metro section is that one is by Fuentes and the other is by Hue.

If Hue has a photograph in the Metro section, then Fuentes must also have a photograph in the Sports section, since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, there must be exactly one photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section.

Lastly, we need to determine the number of photographs in the Sports section by Hue. If Hue has three photographs in total, then one is in Lifestyle and two are in Sports. If Hue has two photographs in total, then one is in Lifestyle and one is in Sports. If Hue has one photograph in total, then it must be in Lifestyle. Therefore, we can't determine the number of photographs in the Sports section by Hue.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Based on the given information, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there are two possibilities:
- The third photographer, Fuentes, has photographs in the Lifestyle and Sports sections.
- The third photographer, Fuentes, has photographs in the Metro and Sports sections.

Thus, neither A, C, D, nor E must be true. However, since there is no constraint preventing Gagnon from having a photograph in the Metro section, it is possible that one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Therefore, the answer is B: "Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon."
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - A total of 6 different photographs are to appear in the newspaper, exactly 2 photographs per section, in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - The available photographs were taken by 3 different photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The newspaper has three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are six photos in total, exactly two per section.
  - Each photographer must have at least one photo but no more than three photos.
  - At least one photo in Lifestyle must be taken by a photographer who has at least one photo in Metro.
  - The number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle is the same as the number of Fuentes' photos in Sports.
  - None of Gagnon's photos can be in Sports.
  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
- Gagnon cannot have any photos in the Sports section (rule #6)
- At least one photo in Lifestyle must be by a photographer who has at least one photo in Metro (rule #5)
  - But Gagnon cannot have any photos in the Sports section, which means Gagnon can only have photos in the Metro and Lifestyle sections.
- Hue must have the same number of photos in Lifestyle as Fuentes has in Sports (rule #6)
  - If Hue has one photo in Lifestyle, Fuentes must also have one photo in Sports, and vice versa.
- Fuentes cannot have any photos in the Metro section (no relevant rule states this, but it follows from the above deductions).

Based on these deductions:
- A cannot be true because we already concluded Fuentes cannot have any photos in Metro.
- B can be true because Gagnon can have one photo in Metro, and Hue must have one photo in Metro.
- C cannot be true because Gagnon cannot have any photos in Sports.
- D can be true because Hue must have the same number of photos in Lifestyle as Fuentes has in Sports.
- E cannot be true because Hue must have one photo in Metro, so he cannot have two photos in Sports.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are 6 photographs in total, 2 per section.
- There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- Each photographer has at least 1 but no more than 3 photographs.
- At least one Lifestyle photograph must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the other Lifestyle photograph must be by Fuentes to satisfy the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. 

Knowledge:
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Therefore, Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section since a Lifestyle photograph by Fuentes is required, and it cannot go into the Sports section. This also means that Fuentes cannot have both photographs in the Sports section because then Hue would have two photographs in the Lifestyle section, which contradicts a given condition. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:

  - Six photographs in total will appear, two in each section of Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.

  - At least one photograph in Lifestyle must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro.
  - Number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in Sports.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in Sports.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
  - Gagnon has only one photograph in Lifestyle and none in Sports.
  - Hue has only one photograph in Lifestyle and none in Sports.
  - Fuentes has one or two photographs in Sports.

A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. (not necessarily true)
B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. (not necessarily true)

Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - A total of six different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon and Hue.
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs.
  - At least one photograph in Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: 
  - If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there are two cases:
    * Case 1: The second photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes.
        - In this case, one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue and the other is by Gagnon and the third photographer, Fuentes, has one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
        - Since one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and we know that Hue has at least one photograph in Lifestyle, then Hue must have at least one photograph in the Metro section.
        - Also, we know that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so he cannot have any photographs in the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. 
        - According to the given conditions, the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section. Since we know that Fuentes has one photograph in the Lifestyle section and Gagnon has none, then Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section, and Hue must have one photograph in the Sports section as well.
        - Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes, and exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
        - So, the correct answer is D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
    * Case 2: The second photograph in the Lifestyle section is not by Fuentes.
        - In this case, one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue and the other is by Gagnon and the third photographer, Fuentes, has two photographs in the Lifestyle section.
        - Since one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and we know that Hue has at least one photograph in Lifestyle, then Hue must have at least one photograph in the Metro section.
        - However, we don't know how many photographs Gagnon has in the Metro section, so we cannot determine which one of the statements about the Metro section is true.
        - Also, we know that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, but we don't know how many photographs Hue and Fuentes have in the Sports section, so we cannot determine which one of the statements about the Sports section is true.
        - Therefore, none of the statements A, B, C, D, or E must be true.
        - So, the correct answer is None of the Above.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- There will be six different photographs, exactly two photographs per section in Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports section.
- Each photographer can take at least one but no more than three photographs.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Since one photograph in Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the remaining two photographs in Lifestyle section will be taken by Fuentes. Moreover, according to the rule that at least one photograph in Lifestyle section must be taken by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro section, either Gagnon or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, the remaining photograph in Metro section will be taken by Fuentes. Finally, following the rule that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, we can conclude that exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- There are six photos in total, exactly two per section for the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
- Each photographer has between one and three photos.
- At least one Lifestyle photo is by a photographer who has at least one photo in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section is the same as the number of Fuentes' photos in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photos are in the Sports section.

If one photo in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
- At least one Lifestyle photo is by Fuentes.
- Gagnon cannot have any photos in the Sports section because none of Gagnon's photos are in that section.
- Two photographers (Fuentes and Hue) must have at least one photo in the Sports section to satisfy the condition that the number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section is the same as the number of Fuentes' photos in the Sports section.

A: It is not necessarily true that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
B: It is not necessarily true that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
C: It is not possible for both photos in the Metro section to be by Gagnon because Gagnon already has a photo in the Lifestyle section.
D: It is not necessarily true that exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue because Fuentes also needs to have at least one photo in the Sports section.
E: It is not necessarily true that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue because Fuentes also needs to have at least one photo in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - A total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section (total of 3 sections).
  - Each section is limited to using photographs taken by three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, it means that one photograph in the Metro section must be by either Gagnon or Hue, and one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes. This is because:
  - Each photographer must have at least one photograph in one of the sections, and Gagnon and Hue already have one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - Because one of the Lifestyle photographs is by Gagnon, Gagnon cannot have a photograph in the Sports section.
  - Because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and Hue already has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. There are three kinds of cookies - oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  3. Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  4. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  5. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  6. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  7. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  Let's assume that no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday. Then, we can infer that the first two batches of cookies were made on Monday and Tuesday, and the third batches of cookies were made on Thursday and Friday to ensure that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. This means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday, so the answer is B. Choice A is not necessarily true since only one batch of cookies may be made on Tuesday. Choice C is not true because we know that only one batch of cookies is made on Monday. Choice D is also not necessarily true as only one batch of cookies may be made on Thursday. Choice E is not necessarily true since we have no information about the number of batches of cookies made on Monday and Tuesday.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - A bakery makes three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then:
- One batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on one of Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
- One batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on one of Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
- One batch of sugar cookies must be made on one of Monday, Tuesday, or Friday.
- No batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.

Option A: It is possible that exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, and the last batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on Thursday and Friday, respectively. So, this option is not always true.
Option B: It is not possible to make three batches of cookies on Friday because the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. So, this option is not true.
Option C: At least one batch of cookies must be made on Monday and it cannot be the case that all three batches are of different kinds. Therefore, at least two batches of the same kind of cookie must be made on Monday. This option is true.
Option D: The second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday, so it is not possible to have two batches of cookies on Thursday. This option is not true.
Option E: This statement cannot be determined from the given information. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. 
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Solution:
  Let's consider the possible scenarios for making the cookies:
  Monday: At least one batch of cookies is made. It could be any of the three types. Let's assume it to be Oatmeal cookies.
  Tuesday: The other two types of cookies must be made today. Let's assume they are Sugar cookies and Peanut Butter cookies.
  Wednesday: No batch of cookies is made.
  Thursday: The second batch of Sugar cookies is made and the first batch of Peanut Butter cookies is made.
  Friday: The second batch of Oatmeal cookies is made and the second batch of Peanut Butter cookies is made.
  We have a valid solution and according to this solution:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are not made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are not made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are not made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are not made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are not made on Monday than on Tuesday.
  So, none of the options are true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there will be exactly three batches of cookies made on the other four days (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday).
  Only one batch of each kind of cookie can be made on a given day.
  
Analysis:
  From the conditions, we know that one batch of cookies must be made on Monday. We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the third and final batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Friday. However, since no two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day, it can't be made on Tuesday or Friday because there are already two batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies made on those two days. Therefore, the third and final batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday. This means that all three batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, one batch on each day.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Each of the three kinds of cookie has three batches per week, for a total of nine batches over the course of the week.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Exactly one batch of each type of cookie is made per day.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we know that there are only two batches of cookies made on that day. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The bakery makes three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only 2 batches of cookies made on Wednesday at most.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then it is possible that two batches of cookies were made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and it is also possible that only one batch of cookies was made on Monday, Thursday, and Friday, and three batches of cookies were made on Tuesday. Thus, we can eliminate options C, D, and E, which make assumptions about the number of batches of cookies made on a specific day. 

Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, we can conclude that exactly three batches of cookies must be made on Friday, as there are already three batches of each kind of cookie made from Monday to Thursday and no more than two batches can be made on any other day. Hence, option B is true.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar, and exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  2. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  3. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  4. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  5. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  6. If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there can be at most one batch of cookies on Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 2, we know that there can be at most one batch of cookies on Wednesday. Then, since there are exactly three batches of each kind of cookie made each week, there must be two batches of cookies on either Tuesday or Friday to make sure there are exactly three batches of cookies made on those two days combined. Therefore, either choice A or B must be true. 
  Choices C and D are both false because condition 2 states that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. 
  Choice E cannot be determined from the given conditions because we don't know how many batches of cookies are made on each day. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies were made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies would also have to be made on Monday, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, which means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Tuesday.
  This leaves only Thursday for the second batch of sugar cookies, and Friday for the last batch of each cookie type.

Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
- There are three batches of each type of cookie, so there are a total of 9 batches of cookies per week.
- Each batch of cookie is made on a different day of the week.
- No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day.
- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
- At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

Analysis:
- If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, we can determine which batches of cookies are made on each day of the week.
- We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and no two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, there must be at least one batch of each type of cookie made on Monday.
- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so they cannot be made on Monday.
- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
- We know that exactly three batches of each type of cookie are made each week, so if we already have two batches of a type of cookie, we know when the third batch will be made.

Action: Answer("B") 
Choice B is the only one that must be true based on the given conditions. If no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, then there must be three batches of cookies made on Friday, since there are a total of nine batches of cookies made each week.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we can conclude that one batch of each kind of cookie is made on Monday, and one batch of each kind of cookie is made on either Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday. 
  Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, then both of these batches must be made on either Tuesday, Thursday or Friday. 
  Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Tuesday or Friday.
  We can conclude that on the day when the second batch of sugar cookies is not made, two batches of cookies are made. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A teacher will assign each of five students—Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga—to exactly one of two research teams, the green team and the red team. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  Two research teams are available: green team and red team.
  One team will have two members, and one team will have three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: We know from the context that Olga is a facilitator and Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Therefore, Lateefah cannot be a facilitator. We also know that Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, and since Olga is a facilitator, Juana cannot be a facilitator. Hence, the only option that must be true is that Juana and Mei are not both facilitators, so the answer is D.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  The assignment has to satisfy the above conditions.
  
Analysis: 
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, and there is only one green team facilitator, it follows that Lateefah is not a facilitator. Since Olga is a facilitator, and there is only one red team facilitator, it follows that Olga is assigned to the red team. So Juana must be assigned to the green team. Since Kelly is not a facilitator, and the green team already has a facilitator, it follows that the red team facilitator must be from Kelly, Mei, or Juana. Therefore, Mei must be the red team facilitator, so Juana and Kelly are not both facilitators.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The five students are Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  The assignment must satisfy the following conditions:
    Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
    Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
    Kelly is not a facilitator.
    Olga is a facilitator.

To determine the correct answer, we can use the given conditions to eliminate answer choices that cannot be true. 
  We know Lateefah is assigned to the green team, so B cannot be true.
  We know Kelly is not a facilitator, so E cannot be true.
  We know Olga is a facilitator, so C must be true.
  If Olga is a facilitator and is on the green team, then Juana must be on the red team, so A must be true.
  If Juana is on the red team and Olga is a facilitator on the green team, then Mei must be the other facilitator, so D must be false.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There will be two research teams, one with two members and the other with three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as a facilitator.
  Lateefah is on the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team from Olga.
Action: Answer("D")
Reasoning:
  There are two scenarios: 
  1. Green team has two members (facilitator: Lateefah), and red team has three members (facilitator: Olga).
  2. Red team has two members (facilitator: Lateefah), and green team has three members (facilitator: Olga).
  In both scenarios, Olga is a facilitator. Therefore, option C is incorrect. 
  Juana is on the team opposite Olga, so if Olga is a facilitator on the red team, then Juana is on the green team. However, if Olga is the facilitator on the green team, Juana is on the red team. Therefore, option A is incorrect and option B is incorrect since Lateefah is already designated as a facilitator. 
  Since Kelly is not a facilitator, there are only two possible facilitators: Olga and Lateefah. If Lateefah is the facilitator on the green team, then Juana and Mei are not facilitators. If Olga is the facilitator on the green team, then Lateefah is the facilitator on the red team, and Mei is not a facilitator. Either way, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators, so the correct answer is D. Option E is also incorrect.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga
  - Two teams: green team and red team
  - One team has 2 members, and the other has 3 members
  - One member of each team will be a facilitator
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team
  - Kelly is not a facilitator
  - Olga is a facilitator
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is

Analysis:
  - Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team has 2 or 3 members and 1 of them is a facilitator, and the red team has 3 or 2 members and 1 of them is a facilitator. 
  - Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be assigned to the green team. 
  - Since Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, Juana must be assigned to the red team. 
  - Mei's team assignment is not specified, but we know that Juana and Olga are on different teams, and Lateefah is on the green team, which means that Kelly and Mei are on the red team.
  - Therefore, Kelly is not a facilitator and Mei's facilitator status is unknown.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are two research teams, green and red. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  2. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  3. Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  4. Kelly is not a facilitator.
  5. Olga is a facilitator.
  6. Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
  From condition 3, Lateefah must be assigned to the green team. 
  From condition 4, Kelly is not a facilitator.
  From condition 5, Olga is a facilitator.
  From condition 6, Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  So, Mei must be assigned to the green team and Olga must be assigned to the red team.
  Thus, neither Juana nor Mei is a facilitator, and Lateefah is the facilitator of the green team.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are two research teams: the green team and the red team.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analysis:
  We know that Lateefah is on the green team and Olga is a facilitator. Therefore, Olga must be the facilitator of the red team because she cannot be the facilitator of the green team. Juana cannot be on the same team as Olga, so she must be on the green team. Mei is the only one left and must be on the red team, making Juana and Mei both non-facilitators. Therefore, A, B, and C are false. D is true because Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. E is false because we know that Olga is a facilitator.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two research teams: a green team and a red team.
  One team has two members, and the other has three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, the green team will have three members, and the red team will have two members. Therefore, Juana and Olga will be on different teams. Since Olga is a facilitator, she cannot be on the same team as Kelly. Therefore, Kelly is on the red team. Juana must then be on the green team. Mei is the only remaining student, so she is on the red team. Therefore, Mei and Kelly are the facilitators.

A: Juana is assigned to the red team. (False)
B: Lateefah is a facilitator. (False)
C: Olga is assigned to the green team. (True)
D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. (True)
E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator. (False)

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, then the green team has three members including Lateefah and the red team has two members. 
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the green team. 
  Juana and Olga must be assigned to different teams.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so she cannot be assigned to the green team which already has Olga as a facilitator.
  Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  Since Olga is assigned to the green team, and one member of each team is a facilitator, then one member of the red team must be a facilitator.
  Thus, Lateefah, the only remaining member of the green team, is not a facilitator.
  
Action: Answer("A") - Juana is assigned to the red team.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  2. There are two teams: green team and red team.
  3. One team has two members and the other has three members.
  4. One member of each team is designated as the facilitator.
  5. Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
  6. Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  7. Kelly is not a facilitator.
  8. Olga is a facilitator.

First, we know that Lateefah is on the green team, and there are only two teams, so the other three members (including one facilitator) must be on the red team. We also know that Olga is a facilitator, so she must be on the red team with two other members, which means Juana must be on the green team with Mei. As a result:

A: Juana is assigned to the red team. False.
B: Lateefah is a facilitator. False.
C: Olga is assigned to the green team. False.
D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. True.
E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator. True.

Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The seven houses are J, K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Solution:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so neither K nor L can be shown after J is shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so the only possibility is that K is shown in the afternoon.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, we know that K < L and L < M.
  Since there are no other constraints, we can have any of the remaining houses shown at any time.
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible since J must be shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown. This is possible since L can be shown in the afternoon after K and before M.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown. This is possible since there are no constraints on when P can be shown.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. This is not possible since there are no constraints on when N and O can be shown.
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. This is possible since there are no constraints on when N and P can be shown.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show 7 houses in total: J, K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  The first two will be shown in the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth will be shown in the afternoon, and the last two will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening, so it can't be one of the first two houses.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  A: If K is shown after J is shown, then J cannot be one of the first two houses shown in the morning. This would mean that K must be one of the first two houses shown in the morning, but this contradicts the fact that K can't be shown in the morning. Therefore, A is false.
  B: Since J must be shown in the evening, L must be shown at some point after J is shown. Therefore, B could be true.
  C: Since J must be shown in the evening, P could not be one of the first two houses shown in the morning. This means that it would have to be shown in the afternoon or evening, so C could be true.
  D: This statement doesn't provide any information that can lead to a conclusion, so it is not useful.
  E: Since L must be shown at some time after K is shown, and N and P cannot be one of the first two houses shown in the morning, N and P must be shown at some time after K is shown. Therefore, E could be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show 7 houses to a buyer during a single day. 
  The first and second houses will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown - This cannot be true since K cannot be shown in the morning.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown - This is possible if J is the first house shown in the morning and L is the sixth or seventh house shown in the evening.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown - This is possible if J is the first house shown in the morning and P is the sixth or seventh house shown in the evening.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is - This cannot be true since there is no restriction on when N and O can be shown, and they do not affect the timing of the other houses.
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is - This cannot be true since N and P can only be shown in the afternoon or evening and K cannot be shown in the morning.
  
Action: Answer("C") - P is shown at some time after J is shown.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The realtor will show 7 houses to a prospective buyer during a single day.
  - The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  - The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  - The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  - J must be shown in the evening.
  - K cannot be shown in the morning.
  - L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Action: 
  Let's analyze each option:
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or the evening. J is shown in the evening, so K cannot be shown after J. Therefore, K must be shown before J, which means that K cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. So, A is false.
  B: J must be shown in the evening, so L cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. Also, L must be shown at some time before M is shown. So, the only possible time for L to be shown is in the afternoon. Therefore, L cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. So, B is false.
  C: J must be shown in the evening, so P cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. So, C is false.
  D: M is shown in the afternoon, so N and O cannot be shown at some time after M is shown because they will be shown in the evening. So, D is false.
  E: K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or the evening. Both N and P will be shown in the evening, so they cannot be shown at some time after K is shown. Therefore, E is false.
  
  None of the above is true, so the most likely answer is the one that says "None of the above". 
  Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. 
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. 
  The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

A: If K is shown at some time after J is shown, then K would be shown in the afternoon or evening. But K cannot be shown in the morning. Thus, this option is not possible.
B: According to the rules, J must be shown in the evening. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Thus, L cannot be shown after J. This option is not possible.
C: According to the rules, J must be shown in the evening. P can be shown in the evening because the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. Thus, this option is possible.
D: According to the rules, the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon. Thus, it is not possible for both N and O to be shown at some time after M is shown. This option is not possible.
E: According to the rules, L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Both N and P can be shown at some time after K is shown because the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. Thus, this option is possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, O, and P—during a single day, with specific time slots for each group of houses.
  J must be shown in the evening, and K cannot be shown in the morning. 
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

A: K must be shown either in the afternoon or evening, so it cannot be shown after J is shown in the evening.
B: L must be shown after K, and J must be shown in the evening, so L cannot be shown after J is shown in the evening.
C: P can be shown in the afternoon or evening, so it could be shown after J is shown in the evening.
D: Both N and O must be shown in the afternoon, so neither of them can be shown after M is shown in the afternoon.
E: Both N and P could be shown in the afternoon or evening, so they could be shown at some time after K is shown.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis: 
  Option A conflicts with the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning, and J must be shown in the evening.
  Option B satisfies the condition that L must be shown at some time after K is shown and before M is shown, and it is possible because J can be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  Option C satisfies the condition that J must be shown in the evening, and P can be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  Option D is not possible because the last two houses must be shown in the evening, and only one house is left to be shown after M.
  Option E is not possible because N and P must be shown at different times, and both are shown after K.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Elimination:
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning, and J must be shown in the evening, so K cannot be shown after J. This choice is not possible.

  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Elimination:
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown. - This cannot be true because J must be shown in the evening, and K cannot be shown in the morning.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown. - This cannot be true because L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. We do not know whether K was shown before or after J.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown. - This could be true because we only know that J must be shown in the evening, and P can be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. - This cannot be true because only two houses are shown in the evening, and J must be one of them.
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. - This cannot be true because we do not know the order of showing after the afternoon session, and we do not have any information to know whether N or P was shown in the afternoon.

Action: Answer("C")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, and the only way to obtain class 3 buildings is by trading class 2 buildings.
  RealProp owns no class 2 buildings, and can trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building, and can trade it for two class 3 buildings or trade the class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, then it will still own a class 2 building and the statement that Trustcorp owns no class 2 building will be false.
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for a building of the same class, then it will still own a class 2 building and the statement that Trustcorp owns no class 2 building will be false.
  Therefore, the only way to ensure that Trustcorp owns no class 2 building is for Trustcorp to trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 1 buildings. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  The only other company that owns class 2 buildings is Southco, which owns one class 2 building.
  RealProp owns one class 1 building.
  RealProp owns two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
Action: Answer("C")  
If Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings and traded one for two class 3 buildings, then Trustcorp would no longer own any class 2 buildings. The only other company that owns class 2 buildings is Southco, therefore, it must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns three buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns two buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns three buildings: King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  There are three types of trades that can occur.
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some trades.

Analysis:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some trades, then they must have traded all their class 2 buildings.
  Southco only owns one class 2 building, so if Trustcorp has no class 2 buildings, then they have not traded with Southco.
  RealProp owns one class 1 building, so if they traded it for two class 2 buildings, then Trustcorp would have acquired a class 2 building, which is not possible.
  If Trustcorp traded their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, then RealProp's class 3 buildings would have to be traded, which means RealProp would have to receive a class 2 building in return, which is not possible. Therefore, RealProp's class 3 buildings must have been traded.
  Trustcorp could have traded their class 2 buildings with RealProp's Zimmer House, which is a class 3 building, and received two class 3 buildings in return.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower) and two class 3 buildings (Yates House, Zimmer House).
  - Southco owns a class 1 building (Flores Tower) and a class 2 building (Lynch Building).
  - Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings (King Building, Meyer Building, Ortiz Building).
  - The only way Trustcorp can end up with no class 2 buildings is trading them for class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  - To trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, Trustcorp needs to have at least one class 2 building initially.
  - Therefore, Trustcorp can only trade their class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings or trade them for other class 2 buildings.

Analysis:
  - If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings, then they have traded them all away for either class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  - The only possible trades that Trustcorp could have made are: 
    * King Building (class 2) for Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3).
    * Meyer Building (class 2) for Garza Tower (class 1) and Yates House (class 3).
    * Ortiz Building (class 2) for Garza Tower (class 1) and Yates House (class 3).
  - From the above trades, we can infer that RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower).
  - We cannot infer whether Southco owns only class 2 buildings or has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  - Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower or the Zimmer House.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three companies (RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp) that own different buildings, which are categorized as class 1, class 2, or class 3. 
  - The trades must be of one of three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  - Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  
  A: There is no information provided that would directly relate to this choice or make it a must be true statement. 
  B: There is no information provided that would directly relate to this choice or make it a must be true statement. 
  C: Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it must have traded a class 2 building with Southco in order for Southco to own a class 2 building. Therefore, this statement must be true and is the correct answer. 
  D: There is no information provided that would directly relate to this choice or make it a must be true statement. 
  E: Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, and the Zimmer House is a class 3 building owned by RealProp. Therefore, this statement cannot be true. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
- The only way Trustcorp can trade a class 2 building is by trading it for two class 3 buildings.
- Southco owns no class 3 buildings, so it cannot trade with Trustcorp for a class 2 building.
- Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
- RealProp owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
- Therefore, the only way for Trustcorp to trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is to trade with RealProp.
- If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building with RealProp, then RealProp would own a class 2 building and Trustcorp would own two class 3 buildings.
- If Trustcorp makes a trade with RealProp, then Southco must make a trade with either RealProp or Trustcorp in order to obtain a class 1 building.
- Therefore, Southco must either trade its class 1 building with Trustcorp for two class 2 buildings or trade its class 2 building with RealProp for two class 3 buildings.

Action: Answer("A")  
If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building with RealProp, then RealProp would own a class 1 building (Garza Tower) and two class 3 buildings (Yates House and Zimmer House). Therefore, A is the correct answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp is required to trade their class 2 buildings for other buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco does not own any class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building (Flores Tower) and a class 2 building (Lynch Building).
  
Analysis:  
  Trustcorp is required to trade its class 2 buildings for other buildings. Therefore, if they don't have any class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that Trustcorp has only traded its class 2 buildings with other buildings. Given that Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, it means that Trustcorp has not made any trades with RealProp, who owns a class 1 building, and has only traded with Southco, who does not own any class 3 buildings. Also, Southco owns a class 1 building, and they cannot trade it for two class 3 buildings. Therefore, Southco must have traded Trustcorp a class 2 building for two class 1 buildings. This means that Southco has at least one class 2 building after the trades.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 building after some number of trades.
  
Analysis:
  We know that Trustcorp started with three class 2 buildings, and each trade must be of one of three kinds. So, Trustcorp could only have traded its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings. If Trustcorp used only trades of type 1, then it would still have class 2 buildings after some number of trades. Therefore, Trustcorp must have made trades of type 2 or type 3. If Trustcorp made trades of type 2, then it would have traded one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, which would mean that Southco owned a class 1 building and two class 2 buildings, but this would contradict the fact that RealProp owns a class 1 building. Therefore, Trustcorp must have only made trades of type 3, which means that Trustcorp traded all three class 2 buildings for six class 3 buildings. This means that RealProp's class 1 building and Southco's class 1 building must still be in the possession of their respective companies. Thus, we can eliminate choices A, C, D, and E. The only option left is B.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  - Southco only owns class 2 and class 1 buildings.
  - Trustcorp owns only class 2 and class 3 buildings, none of which are class 1.
  - The only way for Trustcorp to get rid of its class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  - By trading Trustcorp's class 2 building away, Trustcorp will no longer own any class 2 building.
  
Analysis:
  - Trustcorp owns only class 2 and class 3 buildings, none of which are class 1. Therefore, it cannot trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building, nor can it trade a class 3 building for a class 1 building.
  - The only way Trustcorp can trade away its class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  - After this trade, Trustcorp will no longer own any class 2 building.
  - If Southco trades with Trustcorp, it must give Trustcorp two class 2 buildings, but Trustcorp cannot receive any class 2 building. Therefore, Southco cannot trade with Trustcorp.
  - RealProp could trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, but this does not affect Trustcorp's holdings.
  - Therefore, the only possible trade is between RealProp and Trustcorp, with RealProp trading its class 1 building for two of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings. After the trade, Trustcorp will own only class 3 buildings.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp has to trade one of its class 2 buildings for one or two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns the only class 1 building.
  Southco owns only one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  
Reasoning:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it must have traded both the Meyer Building and the King Building for class 3 buildings. It still owns one building, the Ortiz Building, which is class 2.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower).
  Southco does not own only class 2 buildings because it owns a class 1 building (Flores Tower).
  There is no information to determine if Southco has made a trade with Trustcorp.
  Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower and does not own the Zimmer House.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will fill the six slots of a benefit concert.
  - Slots are numbered 1 to 6, from earliest to latest.
  - Constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Action: 
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Zircon must also perform before Xpert.
  - Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot 6 since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - If Zircon is not in slot 6, then Uneasy must be in slot 6 since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - If Uneasy is in slot 6, then Yardsign must be in slot 1 or 2 since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. 
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Xpert cannot be in slot 6, so Xpert must be in slot 5.
  - Therefore, Vegemite must be in slot 3 since Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Zircon cannot be in slot 2.
  - This leaves Wellspring in slot 4 and Zircon in slot 2.
  - None of the choices match this configuration.
  - Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Vegemite performs before Zircon
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform before Xpert
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert
  
If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then we know that:
- Xpert is in slot 6
- Wellspring is in slot 5

Vegemite performs before Zircon, so Vegemite cannot be in slot 6 and Zircon cannot be in slot 1.

If Uneasy performs in slot 5, then Zircon would be in slot 1, which is not possible. Therefore, Uneasy cannot be in slot 5.

If Vegemite performs in slot 3, then Yardsign would be in slot 1, which is not possible. Therefore, Vegemite cannot be in slot 3.

If Wellspring performs in slot 3, then Zircon would be in slot 1, which is not possible. Therefore, Wellspring cannot be in slot 3.

If Zircon performs in slot 2, then Uneasy would be in slot 6, which is not possible. Therefore, Zircon cannot be in slot 2.

If Zircon performs in slot 4, then Uneasy would be in slot 6, which is possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The six slots of a benefit concert are numbered slot one through slot six.
Bands Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon will perform in the concert.
Each band will perform in just one slot.
Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, it means that the order of the slots that the bands will perform in is as follows:

Yardsign - Vegemite - Zircon - Wellspring - Xpert - Uneasy

Knowledge:
A. If Uneasy performs in slot five, then it would mean that they are not in the last three slots. This contradicts the given information that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Therefore, option A is not true.
B. If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon would have to perform in slot four, which contradicts the given information that Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, option B is not true.
C. Since Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, they must perform in slot four. Therefore, option C could be true.
D. If Zircon performs in slot two, then it would mean that Wellspring and Xpert would have to perform in slots three and four, but we know that Wellspring performs before Xpert. Therefore, option D is not true.
E. If Zircon performs in slot four, it would fit with the given ordering of the bands, and it would be possible for all other bands to perform in their designated slots. Therefore, option E could be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Six slots, numbered slot one through slot six, need to be filled by six bands.
  - Each band will perform in just one slot.
  - The order must meet the following constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the possible scenarios are:
    - (1) Wellspring is in slot two, Xpert is in slot three, Yardsign is in slot one, Vegemite is in slot four, Zircon is in slot five, and Uneasy is in slot six.
    - (2) Wellspring is in slot three, Xpert is in slot four, Yardsign is in slot one, Vegemite is in slot two, Zircon is in slot five, and Uneasy is in slot six.
    - (3) Wellspring is in slot four, Xpert is in slot five, Yardsign is in slot one, Vegemite is in slot two, Zircon is in slot three, and Uneasy is in slot six.
    - (4) Wellspring is in slot five, Xpert is in slot six, Yardsign is in slot one, Vegemite is in slot two, Zircon is in slot three, and Uneasy is in slot four.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
- Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.

Approach:
If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the bands must be: Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, [remaining two bands], in some order. 

We know that Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots and that Vegemite must perform before Zircon. Since Wellspring performs before Xpert and both of them perform after Zircon, there are only two possible orders for Yardsign, Vegemite, and Zircon: Vegemite, Zircon, Yardsign or Zircon, Vegemite, Yardsign.

A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, then the order of the bands would be: Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Yardsign, Uneasy. This is not possible since Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.

B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then the order of the bands would be: Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy. This satisfies all the constraints, so this could be true.

C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then the order of the bands would be: Yardsign, Zircon, Wellspring, Vegemite, Xpert, Uneasy. This violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.

D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then the order of the bands would be: Yardsign, Zircon, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy. This violates the constraint that Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.

E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then the order of the bands would be: Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy. This satisfies all the constraints, so this could be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Xpert must be in slots four and five, in some order.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must be in slot six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign must be in slot one, slot two, or slot three.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, then slot four must be either Wellspring or Xpert. But if Xpert performs in slot four, then Zircon must perform in slot three, which contradicts the constraint that Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Uneasy does not perform in slot five.
  B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then slot two must be either Wellspring or Zircon. But if Zircon performs in slot two, then Xpert must perform in slot one, which contradicts the constraint that Xpert must perform in a later slot than Wellspring and Zircon. Therefore, Vegemite does not perform in slot three.
  C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then the order of the first three slots must be Yardsign, Wellspring, and Zircon (in some order). But if Zircon performs in slot two, then Xpert must perform in slot one, which contradicts the constraint that Xpert must perform in a later slot than Wellspring and Zircon. Therefore, Wellspring does not perform in slot three.
  D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then the order of the first three slots must be Yardsign, Zircon, and Wellspring (in some order). But if Wellspring performs in slot four, then Xpert must perform in slot five, which contradicts the constraint that Xpert must perform in a later slot than Wellspring and Zircon. Therefore, Zircon does not perform in slot two.
  E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then slot three must be either Wellspring or Xpert. But if Xpert performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot two, which contradicts the constraint that Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Zircon does not perform in slot four.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will fill the six slots of a benefit concert.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
Process of elimination:
  - Option A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, then Zircon performs in slot six, and Yardsign performs in slot one. But this would violate the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Therefore, option A is not true.
  - Option B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign performs in slot one, and Zircon performs in slot six. But this would violate the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, option B is not true.
  - Option C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Zircon performs in slot six, and Xpert performs in slot four. But this would violate the constraint that Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert. Therefore, option C is not true.
  - Option D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then Wellspring performs in slot one, and Xpert performs in slot three. But this would violate the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, option D is not true.
  - Option E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then Wellspring performs in slot three, and Xpert performs in slot five. This satisfies all the constraints, so option E could be true.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Six slots numbered from one to six need to be filled, each slot with a different band.
- Constraints:
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
- If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots two and three in some order. 

Analysis:
- Zircon cannot perform in slot two because that would mean Wellspring would have to perform in slot one, which is before one of the slots that Yardsign can perform in.
- Zircon cannot perform in slot six because it would not be before Xpert.
- If Wellspring is performing in slot two, then the only possible order for the first three slots is Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring.
- Therefore the only possible slot for Uneasy is slot five.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six slots, numbered slot one through slot six.
  2. Six different bands will perform, one in each slot.
  3. The order of slots must meet the following constraints:
      - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
      - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
      - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
      - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  4. Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
  A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, then there is only one slot left for Yardsign, and it cannot be slot one or slot two, which contradicts the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. So, this choice is not possible.
  B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot six, which contradicts the constraint that Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. So, this choice is not possible.
  C: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. Since Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, Wellspring must perform in slot four and Xpert must perform in slot five. This choice is possible.
  D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then Vegemite must perform in slot one, which contradicts the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. So, this choice is not possible.
  E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then Wellspring must perform in slot three, which contradicts the constraint that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. So, this choice is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered one through six.
  - There are six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
Analysis:
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Xpert performs in slot six.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Wellspring cannot perform in slot one or two.
  - Therefore, Wellspring performs in slot four or five.
  - Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, and Wellspring cannot perform in slot one or two, Yardsign must perform in slot one or two.
  - Since Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Yardsign must perform in slot one or two, Vegemite cannot perform in slot one or two.
  - Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot three or four.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, Zircon performs in slot two.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
  If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. This means that either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen. However, we also know that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Since Ong was already assigned, the only way that Kayne can be assigned is if Jaramillo is also assigned. This means that Jaramillo must be assigned to one of the two remaining countries. Finally, according to the constraints, Landon must be assigned to Zambia. Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("B") Jaramillo and Novetzke.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to any country, then Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to one of the other two countries.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia or Yemen. Since Landon is assigned to Zambia, Kayne cannot be assigned there. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This means that Novetzke is ruled out for Yemen, and must be assigned to either Zambia or Venezuela, along with Jaramillo. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Jaramillo and Novetzke 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  2. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  3. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  4. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  5. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Solving the problem by elimination:
  - According to constraint 5, Landon is assigned to Zambia, so he cannot be assigned to Yemen or Venezuela.
  - According to constraint 4, Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. So, we have two cases:
    - Case 1: Kayne is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, and Novetzke is not. In this case, according to constraint 2, Jaramillo should also be assigned to an ambassadorship, which leaves Novetzke unassigned. So, this case is not possible.
    - Case 2: Novetzke is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, and Kayne is not. In this case, we can assign Jaramillo to the remaining ambassadorship to meet constraint 2. And, according to constraint 3, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, which means he should be assigned to Zambia. So, the assignments are Novetzke to Venezuela, Jaramillo to Yemen, and Kayne to Zambia.
    
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
Action: 
  From the constraints, we know that Ong cannot be assigned to Yemen or Zambia. Thus, the remaining two countries are Yemen and Zambia. 
  If Landon is assigned to Zambia, then Kayne and Novetzke must be assigned to Venezuela and Yemen, respectively, to meet the constraint. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela as well, and Novetzke must be assigned to Zambia. Thus, Landon would be assigned to Yemen. 
  Therefore, the possible combinations of ambassadors are:
    - Jaramillo and Landon (if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela and Landon to Yemen)
    - Jaramillo and Novetzke (if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela and Novetzke to Zambia)
    - Kayne and Landon (if Landon is assigned to Zambia and Kayne to Yemen)
    - Kayne and Novetzke (if Novetzke is assigned to Zambia and Kayne to Venezuela)
    - Landon and Novetzke (if Landon is assigned to Zambia and Novetzke to Venezuela)
  Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, so Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship.
  Landon is assigned to Zambia if he is assigned to any ambassadorship.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Logic: 
  Since Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. 
  If Jaramillo is one of the ambassadors, then Kayne must also be one of the ambassadors. This means that either Novetzke or Landon should be assigned to the remaining country. 
  If Novetzke is assigned to the remaining country, then Kayne cannot be assigned to any country. Therefore, Landon should be assigned to the remaining country. 
  If Landon is assigned to the remaining country, then either Kayne or Novetzke can be assigned to the remaining country. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: 
  We know that Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, and Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, the only option is for Kayne to be assigned as ambassador to Zambia and Novetzke to be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. According to the constraints, Jaramillo must be assigned as an ambassador with Kayne. Landon must be assigned as an ambassador to Zambia. So, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon. Therefore, the answer is A.
  Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  2. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned.
  3. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  5. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  So, Ong is assigned to Venezuela, which means Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. And if Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned. Therefore, neither Jaramillo nor Kayne can be assigned to Yemen. Thus, either Novetzke or Landon will be assigned to Yemen. Landon is assigned to Zambia, so Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen. This leaves Jaramillo and Kayne to be assigned to the remaining countries, but it is not specified which ambassador will be assigned to which country.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  One ambassador will be assigned to each country.
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. From the given statements, we don't know which ambassador is assigned to Yemen, but we do know that it is not Kayne. We also know that Landon is assigned to Zambia. Therefore, the ambassadors assigned to other countries must be Jaramillo and Novetzke. So, the answer is A: Jaramillo and Landon.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Ong is assigned as the ambassador to Venezuela.
- Landon is assigned as the ambassador to Zambia, if assigned to any country.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Ong must not be assigned as the ambassador to Yemen.
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.

Action: Answer("E") 

If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This means either Jaramillo or Novetzke must be assigned as the ambassador to Yemen. If Jaramillo is assigned to Yemen, then Kayne must be assigned to one of the remaining countries, which means Novetzke must be assigned to the last country. Therefore, the possible assignments are Jaramillo to Yemen, Kayne to Zambia, and Novetzke to Venezuela. This leaves Landon to be assigned to the last remaining country, which is Zambia. Thus, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Landon and Novetzke. Therefore, the answer is (E) Landon and Novetzke.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three countries to which new ambassadors need to be assigned: Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. 
  - There are five candidates for the ambassadorships: Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong.
  - Only one ambassador can be assigned to each country, and no ambassador can be assigned to more than one country.
  - The following constraints must be met:
    - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
    - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
    - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
    - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
    
Analysis:
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to another country, then Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela.
  - If Landon is assigned as ambassador, it must be to Zambia.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned as an ambassador.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be Landon and Novetzke.

Also, both photographers have at least one photograph in one of the sections, and none of Gagnon's photographs are in the Sports section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is not specified, so it is not a problem that both photographs in Sports are taken by Hue. Therefore, this selection is acceptable.

C: Both photographs in Lifestyle are by Fuentes and both are by Gagnon in Metro, which violates the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, this selection is not acceptable.

D: Both photographs in Sports are taken by Hue, which violates the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Also, both photographs in Metro are taken by Gagnon, which does not satisfy the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, this selection is not acceptable.

E: One photograph in Lifestyle is by Gagnon, but none of Gagnon's photographs can be in Sports. Also, both photographs in Metro are taken by Hue, which does not satisfy the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
A: If Greyhounds are on day 1, then Siamese cannot be on day 2 because no breed can be featured on two consecutive days. Therefore, A is not possible.
B: If Himalayans are not featured on day 1, and no breed can be featured on two consecutive days, then it is not possible for Greyhounds and Himalayans to both be featured on day 7. Therefore, B is not possible.
C: If Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, then they cannot be featured on day 1 or day 7. Therefore, if Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4, then Himalayans must be featured on days 2, 3, and 4. Since no breed can be featured on two consecutive days, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 3. Therefore, C is not possible.
D: If Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5, then Himalayans cannot be featured on day 4 (because Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans), and therefore Himalayans must be featured on days 2, 3, and 5. Since no breed can be featured on two consecutive days, Manx cannot be featured on day 4. Therefore, D is not possible.
E: If Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6, then Himalayans cannot be featured on day 5 (because Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans), and therefore Himalayans must be featured on days 2, 3, and 4. Since no breed can be featured on two consecutive days, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 3 and Siamese cannot be featured on day 4. Therefore, the only remaining breeds are Manx and Newfoundlands, which could be featured on day 6. Therefore, E is possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
Analysis:
  - Using the given information, we can create a table with the possible breeds that can be featured on each day:
  
| Day | Puppy 1 | Kitten 1 | Puppy 2 | Kitten 2 | Puppy 3 | Kitten 3 |
|-----|---------|----------|---------|----------|---------|----------|
| 1   | Greyhound | X         | X        | X         | X        | X         |
| 2   | X        | Siamese  | X        | X         | X        | X         |
| 3   | X        | X         | X        | Himalayan | X        | X         |
| 4   | X        | X         | X        | X         | X        | Himalayan |
| 5   | X        | X         | Rottweiler | X         | X        | X         |
| 6   | X        | X         | X        | X         | Newfoundland | Manx |
| 7   | X        | X         | X        | X         | X        | X         |

  - Using the table, we can verify the following:
    - Choice A is not possible because Greyhounds cannot be featured on consecutive days.
    - Choice B is not possible because Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1 and no breed can be featured on both day 1 and day 7.
    - Choice C is not possible because Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans.
    - Choice D is possible, since no breed can be featured on consecutive days and Rottweilers and Manx have not been featured on any of the previous four days.
    - Choice E is not possible because Newfoundlands cannot be featured on any of the first five days.

---|---|---
1 | Greyhound | 
2 | Newfoundland | 
3 | Rottweiler | 
4 | Manx | Himalayan
5 | Greyhound | 
6 | Rottweiler | Siamese
7 |  | Newfoundland

Now let's check each option.

A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2. This is not possible because Greyhounds cannot be featured on two consecutive days.

B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7. This is not possible because any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7 and Greyhounds are featured on day 1.

C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4. This is possible according to the chart above.

D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5. This is not possible because Manx was featured on day 4 and no breed can be featured on two consecutive days.

E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6. This is possible according to the chart above.

Therefore, the answer is C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
Response 4:

- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Choice A is not possible because no breed can be featured on day 2 if Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- Choice B is not possible because any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Choice C is not possible because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.

- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1, they cannot be featured on day 2, and thus choice A is not possible.
- Similarly, since any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7, and thus choice B is not possible.
- Since Himalayans are not featured on day 1, they must be featured on days 2-4, and thus they cannot be featured on day 4 again with Rottweilers, making choice C not possible.
- Since Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, they cannot be featured on day 5 with Manx, making choice D not possible.
- Therefore, choice E is the only one that could be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:

- Since no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 3 or day 4.
- Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, they cannot be featured on day 1 or day 7. Therefore, they can be featured on day 2, day 3, day 4, day 5, or day 6.

- If Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 2, day 3, or day 4 if Himalayans are featured on those days.

Answer:
A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2 - Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 2, so this is not possible.
B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7 - This is not possible because any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4 - This is not possible because if Himalayans are featured on day 4, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 3 or day 4.
D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5 - This is possible if Himalayans are featured on day 2, day 3, or day 6. 
E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6 - This is not possible because no breed can be featured on both day 6 and day 7.

C: This choice cannot be true because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
D: This choice cannot be true because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.

- This is not possible because no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.

B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
- This is not possible because any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1.

C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
- This is not possible because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  5 students - Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  They each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez both review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two students review exactly the same play or plays.
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review Tamerlane.
  
  A: Megregian must review Undulation since three students must review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill must review Tamerlane since three students already reviewed Undulation. 
  C: Jiang cannot review Undulation since neither Megregian nor Lopez reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  D: Lopez must review Tamerlane since exactly two students review Tamerlane.
  E: There is no information on O'Neill reviewing Sunset. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Five students review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation. 
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. 
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane. Therefore:
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the two students who review exactly the same play are Kramer and O'Neill.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Since Kramer is one of the two students who review the same play, and since at most three studentsReview Undulation, Kramer does not review Undulation. Therefore, only Lopez and Megregian review Undulation.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang does not review Undulation.

A: Megregian must review Undulation, so this is not true.
B: O'Neill must review Tamerlane, so this is not true.
C: This is not true, since Jiang does not review Undulation.
D: This is not true, since O'Neill reviews Tamerlane.
E: This is not true, since O'Neill reviews Tamerlane and not Sunset.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
 - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
 - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
 - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
 - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
 
We know that exactly three of the students review Undulation, and since only 5 students are reviewing the plays we know that the other two cannot review Undulation. Therefore, the following has to be true:
- Kramer and O'Neill do not review Undulation.

A: Megregian could still review Undulation.
B: O'Neill does not review Undulation, we know this to be true.
C: Jiang could still review Undulation, but since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, this choice is not likely.
D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane, but we know for certain that only Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, so this choice is not possible.
E: O'Neill cannot review Sunset, since we know O'Neill and Kramer review the same play (Tamerlane), this choice is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Five students review exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then only two of the students can share a play, since each of the three plays must be reviewed by at least one student.
  Also, since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, neither of them can review Undulation.

A: If Megregian does not review Undulation, then all three students who review Undulation must be among Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, and O'Neill. But since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they cannot review Undulation. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

B: If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then there are two possibilities: (1) Kramer and Lopez both review Undulation, or (2) one of Kramer or Lopez reviews Undulation and the other reviews both Sunset and Tamerlane. Either way, two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, this choice is possible.

C: If Jiang reviews Undulation, then none of the other students who review plays can review Undulation. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

D: If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then neither Kramer nor O'Neill can review Tamerlane (since exactly two students can share a play, and they already share a play with each other). Therefore, this choice is not possible.

E: If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then two of the other students must review exactly the same play or plays as each other (since there are only three plays and four students left). Therefore, this choice is possible.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Five students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation), but do not review any other plays.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the two other students must have reviewed the same play or plays.
  
Analysis: 
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed the same play or plays. Therefore, either two students reviewed Tamerlane and the other two reviewed Sunset or one student reviewed Sunset and another student reviewed Tamerlane. Based on the given information, if Megregian reviews fewer plays than both Kramer and Lopez, then Megregian must have reviewed Sunset, which means that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane. Now, if Jiang also reviewed Tamerlane, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Tamerlane, which contradicts given information. Therefore, Jiang must have reviewed Sunset. However, we cannot say anything about whether O'Neill reviewed Undulation or not. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Five students reviewed three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. 
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Categorizing the students and the plays:
  Students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
  Plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation

Given that exactly three of the students reviewed Undulation, we know that only two students did not review it. 
If some student reviewed two of the three plays, then at most two students could review the same play.
Therefore, the students who reviewed Undulation reviewed only that play. 
Thus, we can make the following deductions:
  - Two students reviewed the same play that is not Undulation.
  - Only two students didn't review Undulation.
  - O'Neill and Kramer reviewed Tamerlane. 
  - Megregian reviewed more than one play.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play Jiang reviewed.

A: If Megregian didn't review Undulation, then he/she reviewed either Sunset or Tamerlane. This leads to the following combinations of play assignments:
  - Jiang: Undulation, Kramer: Tamerlane, Lopez: Sunset, Megregian: Tamerlane, O'Neill: Undulation (Contradicts that only two students didn't review Undulation)
  - Jiang: Undulation, Kramer: Tamerlane, Lopez: Sunset, Megregian: Sunset, O'Neill: Undulation (Contradicts that only two students didn't review Undulation)
Therefore, A cannot be true.

B: If O'Neill didn't review Undulation, he must have reviewed Sunset. This leads to the following combinations of play assignments:
  - Jiang: Undulation, Kramer: Tamerlane, Lopez: Undulation, Megregian: Tamerlane, O'Neill: Sunset
This combination is consistent with all the given conditions. Therefore, B could be true.

C: Jiang cannot review Undulation because it is already assigned to three students. Therefore, C cannot be true.

D: Lopez cannot review Tamerlane because Tamerlane is already assigned to two students, Kramer and O'Neill. Therefore, D cannot be true.

E: O'Neill reviewed Tamerlane, therefore, he cannot review Sunset. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Five students - Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian and O'Neill, review one or more of three plays - Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. 
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed the same play or plays as each other.
Solution:
  Possible combinations of students who could have reviewed the same play or plays as each other are (Kramer, O'Neill) and (Lopez, Megregian). 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot be the pair that reviewed same play or plays as each other.
  So, Lopez and Megregian must be the pair that reviewed same play(s) as each other, and both of them reviewed the play Undulation.
  Now, based on the given conditions:
    Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So, Jiang does not review Undulation.
    Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So, Megregian reviewed all three plays. Hence, Megregian reviews Undulation.
  Therefore, Megregian reviews Undulation.
  A is not possible since Megregian reviewed Undulation.
  B is possible since it is not mentioned that O'Neill reviewed Undulation.
  C is not possible since Jiang does not review Undulation.
  D is not possible since it is mentioned that Lopez did not review any play reviewed by Jiang and Megregian reviewed Undulation.
  E is not possible since it is mentioned that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Kramer and Lopez < Megregian for number of reviews.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill.
  - Three plays reviewed: Sunset, Tamerlane, Undulation.
Action: 
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the two remaining students must review the same play or plays. There are only two plays left for them to review, Tamerlane and Sunset. Therefore, there are only two possible pairs of students who can review the same play or plays.
  - The pair is either Kramer and O'Neill or Kramer and Lopez.
  If Megregian reviewed Undulation, then none of the remaining students Kramer or Lopez could have reviewed the same play as Megregian since neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews. Thus, Megregian could not have reviewed Undulation (contradicting the fact that exactly three students reviewed it).
  So (A) can't be true.
  If O'Neill reviewed Undulation, then Kramer must have reviewed Tamerlane, and Lopez must have reviewed Sunset. From this, we know that Megregian also reviewed Tamerlane (since Megregian > Kramer and Lopez). This would mean that all five students reviewed plays, contradicting the given information that exactly three reviewed Undulation. So (B) can't be true. 
  If Jiang reviewed Undulation, then neither Megregian nor Lopez could have reviewed the play. This would mean that all three of them reviewed one of the plays Tamerlane or Sunset, which would contradict the fact that exactly two of the students reviewed the same play or plays. So (C) can't be true.
  If Lopez reviewed Tamerlane, then Kramer must have reviewed Tamerlane, Megregian must have reviewed Sunset (since he/she reviews fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez and doesn't review any play that Jiang reviews), and O'Neill must have reviewed Undulation. This satisfies all conditions and thus (D) is a possible truth.
  If O'Neill reviewed Sunset, then Kramer must have reviewed Tamerlane, Megregian must have reviewed Undulation, and Lopez must have reviewed Tamerlane as he/she can't review any play Megregian reviews. This satisfies all conditions and thus (E) is a possible truth. 
  In conclusion, either (D) or (E) could be true.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Five students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) review one or more of exactly three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play that Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students review Tamerlane. Based on the rules, we can deduce the following:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they are two of the students who review the same play.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation, since they do not review any play that Jiang reviews. Therefore, they are the two remaining students who review the same play (Tamerlane).
Therefore, we know that:
  - The students who review Tamerlane are Kramer, O'Neill, and either Lopez or Megregian.
  - The students who review Undulation are Jiang and the two remaining students who did not review Tamerlane.
  
A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
If Megregian does not review Undulation, then the three students who reviewed Undulation are Jiang and the two students who did not review Tamerlane. This means the students who reviewed Tamerlane are O'Neill, Kramer, and Lopez, which violates the condition that only two of the students can review the same play. Therefore, this choice is not true.

B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then the three students who reviewed Undulation are Jiang and the two students who did not review Tamerlane. This means the students who reviewed Tamerlane are Kramer, Lopez, and Megregian. This satisfies all the conditions and is a possible scenario. Thus, this choice could be true.

C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
This is true based on the information given.

D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
This is also a possible scenario, as previously explained. Thus, this choice could be true.

E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
This choice is not possible, as we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, we cannot have O'Neill also review Sunset.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: There are five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—reviewing three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation. Two students review the same play or plays as each other. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. The number of students reviewing Undulation is 3. 
A: If Megregian does not review Undulation, then three students reviewed Tamerlane and Undulation, which means Jiang reviewed either Tamerlane or Undulation, which contradicts the rules. Therefore, this option is not true.
B: From the rules, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. For three people to review Undulation and for that option to be true, one of Kramer or O'Neill must be one of the three reviewing Undulation. Therefore, O'Neill cannot be the person who is not reviewing Undulation. This option is not true.
C: Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. And since three people review Undulation, Jiang could be one of them without contradicting any of the rules. Therefore, this option could be true.
D: From the rules, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, Lopez cannot review Tamerlane if he/she didn't review any play that Jiang reviewed. Therefore, this option is not true.
E: There is no indication about who reviewed Sunset in the rules. Therefore, O'Neill might have reviewed Sunset while reviewing Tamerlane but not Undulation. Therefore, this option could be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Each client has two targets - one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  Service targets are set at 3 days, 2 days or 1 day.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Solution: 
- A 1-day website target can be set for Truvest and Solide, but not for Image, since Image's voicemail response target would have to be longer than the website response target.
- A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all the clients.
- A 2-day website target can be set for Solide and Truvest, but not for Image, since Image's voicemail response target would have to be shorter than the website response target.
- A 3-day voicemail target can be set for all the clients.
- A 3-day website target can be set for all the clients.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest. 
Two service targets are set for each client, one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
The service targets can be 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
There are six targets in total (two for each client). 
From the given conditions, we know that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
We need to examine all the targets and see which one cannot be set for more than one client.

Option A: a 1-day website target - This target may be available to all clients, so it cannot be the answer.
Option B: a 2-day voicemail target - This target may be available to all clients, so it cannot be the answer.
Option C: a 2-day website target - This target may be available to both Solide and Truvest, as Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, it is possible that this target can be set for two clients.
Option D: a 3-day voicemail target - This target may be available to all clients, so it cannot be the answer.
Option E: a 3-day website target - This target may be available to all clients, so it cannot be the answer.

Action: Answer("C") - a 2-day website target is the only target that may be available to two clients, namely Solide and Truvest. Therefore, it is the answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Six service targets need to be set for three clients, with each client having two targets (one for website, one for voicemail).
  The targets are 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days.
  Conditions:
    1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Analysis:
  To determine which target cannot be set for more than one client, we need to examine each target's conditions and see if there is any overlap between them.
  A: a 1-day website target: This target could be set for multiple clients, as long as the voicemail target is longer than 1 day.
  B: a 2-day voicemail target: This target could be set for multiple clients, as long as the website target is shorter than 2 days.
  C: a 2-day website target: This target could be set for multiple clients, as long as the voicemail target is longer than 2 days.
  D: a 3-day voicemail target: This target could be set for multiple clients, as long as the website target is shorter than 3 days.
  E: a 3-day website target: This target could be set for multiple clients, as long as the voicemail target is longer than 3 days.
  
Conclusion:
  None of the targets could be set for only one client, so the answer is None of the Above. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The target times are 3 days, 2 days, and 1 day.
  Two targets are set for each client.
  Image has the shortest voicemail target.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  No client's website target can be longer than its voicemail target.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company plans to set two targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Using the given conditions, the following targets can be set for each client:
- Image: 1-day voicemail, 2-day website (since the website target can't be longer than the voicemail target)
- Solide: 2-day voicemail, 1-day website (since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target)
- Truvest: 2-day voicemail, 2-day website (since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target)

Therefore, the following target cannot be set for more than one of the clients:
Action: Answer("E") a 3-day website target
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The maintenance company receives service requests from 3 clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client: one for requests received through the maintenance company's website, and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The targets are set at 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
If one of the choices could apply to all three clients, then it violates one of the conditions. 
- Choice A cannot be correct because all three clients could have a 1-day website target (since none of the voicemail targets can be longer than the website targets). 
- Choice B is correct because if, for example, Truvest has a 2-day voicemail target, then no other client could have a 2-day voicemail target (because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets).
- Choice C cannot be correct because one of the clients (Solide) must have a website target shorter than Truvest's website target. 
- Choice D cannot be correct because all three clients could have a 3-day voicemail target (since none of the website targets can be longer than the voicemail targets). 
- Choice E cannot be correct because one of the clients (Solide) must have a website target shorter than Truvest's website target.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The company has 3 clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  The company sets two service targets for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 

Elimination:
  - If a 1-day website target can be set for one client, it can be set for other clients as well.
  - A 2-day voicemail target can be set for multiple clients since it is not mentioned that it cannot be set for more than one client.
  - A 2-day website target cannot be set for Truvest since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - A 3-day voicemail target can be set for multiple clients since it is not mentioned that it cannot be set for more than one client.
  - A 3-day website target cannot be set for Image since None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The company sets two service targets for each client, one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
- Two clients can't have the same target for the same request channel.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
- Option A: a 1-day website target could be set for more than one client since the prompt doesn't place any restrictions on website targets.
- Option B: because no two clients can have the same voicemail target, a 2-day voicemail target cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
- Option C:  a 2-day website target could be set for more than one client as long as the clients don't have conflicting requirements for their website targets.
- Option D: a 3-day voicemail target could be set for more than one client, again as long as the clients don't have conflicting requirements for their voicemail targets.
- Option E: a 3-day website target can be set for more than one client, as there are no restrictions on website targets.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. Targets are set for 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days. The following conditions exist:
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

To determine the answer to this question, we need to consider which target cannot be set for two different clients.

Analysis:
- The 1-day website target can be set for multiple clients as long as their voicemail target is also 1 day, since none of the clients' website targets can be longer than their voicemail targets.
- The 2-day voicemail target can be set for multiple clients, since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than their voicemail target.
- If we consider the 2-day website target, we have to divide into possibilities: if this is set for Solide's website requests, Truvest's website target must be set for 3 days, according to the rule that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. On the other hand, if the 2-day website target is set for Truvest's website requests, there is no problem because Solide's website target can be set for any of the three options. In any case, the 2-day website target can be set for more than one client.
- The 3-day voicemail target can be set for multiple clients, since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than their voicemail target.
- The 3-day website target can be set for multiple clients, since none of the clients' website targets can be longer than their voicemail targets.


Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The targets are 3-day, 2-day, or 1-day.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  Trades can be made in three ways:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to make only one trade.
    
Analysis:
  - The Flores Tower is a class 1 building, so it must be traded with two class 2 buildings. This means that Flores Tower cannot be traded for Garza Tower as it is also a class 1 building.
  - The Yates House and the Zimmer House are both class 3 buildings, which cannot be traded for class 1 or class 2 buildings.
  - This leaves the Garza Tower as the only building that can be traded for either a class 1 building or two class 2 buildings.
  - Trustcorp has all the class 2 buildings, so the trade for Garza Tower must be with Trustcorp.
  - Therefore, we can conclude that RealProp will trade the Garza Tower with Trustcorp for either one class 1 building or two class 2 buildings.
  - This means that Trustcorp will have two class 1 buildings and one class 3 building, and Realprop will have one class 3 building and either two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  - Southco cannot participate in this trade because it does not have any buildings that can be traded for Garza Tower.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The trade must be one of the following:
    - One building for one other building of the same class.
    - One class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    - One class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.

Elimination:
  Options A and D include a trade of a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, but Southco only has one class 1 building. Thus Options A and D can be eliminated.
  
Analysis:
  Options B, C, and E include one class 1 building, two class 2 buildings, and two class 3 buildings. This is possible under the given conditions. 
  - Option B would require RealProp to trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings, but Trustcorp has only one class 1 building. Thus Option B can be eliminated.
  - Option C would require RealProp to trade the Yates House (class 3) for two class 2 buildings, but the Yates House is not a class 2 building. Thus Option C can be eliminated.
  - Option E could be possible since all the buildings belong to each of the three classes. 
  
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
  1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
  2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  
Analysis: 
  Based on the information given, it is impossible to trade any of the class 3 buildings for class 1 buildings, which eliminates trades of the type 2 and type 3. 
  
  The Flores Tower is the only class 1 building, so it can only be traded for buildings of class 1, which eliminates option B and D. 
  
  In option A, all three companies end up owning a class 1 building, which is not possible since there is only one class 1 building available. 
  
  Option C fulfills all the requirements:
  - RealProp trades Garza Tower (Class 1) for Lynch Building (Class 2).
  - Southco trades Flores Tower (Class 1) for Yates House (Class 3) and Zimmer House (Class 3).
  - Trustcorp keeps the King Building (Class 2), Meyer Building (Class 2), and Ortiz Building (Class 2).
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns a class 1, a class 3, and another class 3 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  A trade has to be between buildings of the same class or between buildings of different classes as specified.
 
  A: This trade does not satisfy any of the three types of trades specified and, additionally, would require a class 2 building to be traded for a class 1 building.
  B: This trade satisfies the third type of trade specified. Therefore, it is not a possible scenario.
  C: This trade does not satisfy any of the three types of trades specified and would require a class 1 building to be traded for two class 3 buildings and a class 3 building to be traded for a class 2 building.
  D: This trade does not satisfy any of the three types of trades specified and would require either a class 1 building to be traded for two class 3 buildings or a class 3 building to be traded for a class 2 building.
  E: This trade does not satisfy any of the three types of trades specified and would require a class 1 building to be traded for two class 3 buildings and a class 3 building to be traded for a class 2 building. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis: To match the ownership of buildings after only one trade, we need to determine who has a building of class 1, 2, and 3. Furthermore, we need to consider the types of trades that can be made by each company while maintaining an equal number of buildings. From the given options, the only option that satisfies these conditions is option E. RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings. Southco owns a class 2 building and a class 1 building. Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings. For RealProp to trade their class 1 building, they need to trade it with Southco for two class 2 buildings. Southco can then trade the received Class 1 building with Trustcorp for two class 3 buildings, where Trustcorp gives two of its class 2 buildings instead. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns class 1, 3, and 3 buildings.
  Southco owns class 1 and 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp owns 3 class 2 building.
  One trade must involve trading one building of a certain class for two buildings of a different specified class or trading two buildings of the same class.
  
  A: In order for RealProp to have the Flores Tower, it would have had to trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings, which means it would also have to give up the Yates House or Zimmer House. Since both of those buildings are class 3, it is not possible for RealProp to make this trade and end up with the Flores Tower. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
  B: In this option, RealProp would need to trade one of its class 3 buildings for a class 2 building from Trustcorp. But Trustcorp has only class 2 buildings, therefore it is not possible for RealProp to get a class 2 building from Trustcorp. This option is not possible.
  
  C: RealProp would have to trade one of its class 3 buildings for a class 1 building from Southco. Southco only has 1 class 1 building, therefore it is not possible for RealProp to get a class 1 building from Southco. This option is not possible.
  
  D: RealProp would have to trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, one of which would have to come from Trustcorp. Trustcorp only has three class 2 buildings, therefore it is not possible for Trustcorp to give one of its class 2 buildings to RealProp and still have two class 2 buildings left. This option is not possible.
  
  E: This option is possible because RealProp could trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, one from Southco and one from Trustcorp. Southco would have to give up the Flores Tower in return for RealProp's Garza Tower, and Trustcorp would have to give up two of their class 2 buildings in return for Southco's Flores Tower and RealProp's Garza Tower. Therefore, this option is possible.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - RealProp: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3)
  - Southco: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2)
  - Trustcorp: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2)
  - The possible trade options are:
      - Trade 1 class 1 building for 2 class 2 buildings
      - Trade 1 class 2 building for 2 class 3 buildings
      - Trade 1 building for another building of the same class
Action: Answer("D") 
  - The trade involves one class 1 building and two class 2 buildings
  - RealProp only has one class 1 building, which is Garza Tower
  - Southco only has one class 1 building, which is Flores Tower
  - Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings, so it could give up two of them
  - Therefore, the trade could be RealProp trading Garza Tower for Trustcorp's Meyer Building and King Building, and Trustcorp trading two of their class 2 buildings (Ortiz Building and King Building) for RealProp's Yates House and Zimmer House.
  - After the trade, the ownership would be: 
    RealProp: Garza Tower, Yates House, and Zimmer House
    Southco: Flores Tower, Lynch Building
    Trustcorp: Meyer Building, Ortiz Building
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp has three buildings, two of which are class 3.
  Southco has two buildings, one of which is class 1 and the other is class 2.
  Trustcorp has three buildings, all of which are class 2.
  There are only three possible ways of trading buildings.
  For option A, RealProp would need to trade their class 1 building, but there is no class 2 building for them to receive in return.
  For option B, RealProp would need to trade their class 3 building for a class 1 building, but there is no class 1 building for them to receive in return.
  For option C, the trades are possible: RealProp trades the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower, Southco trades the Lynch Building for the Yates House and the Zimmer House, and Trustcorp trades the Meyer Building for the Garza Tower.
  For option D, RealProp would need to trade their class 1 or class 3 building for a class 2 building, but there is no class 2 building for them to receive in return.
  For option E, RealProp trades the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower, Southco trades the Lynch Building for the Yates House and the Zimmer House, and Trustcorp trades the King Building for the Zimmer House.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. 
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  
  In order to trade, companies need to find another company who owns the required class of building for the trade.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W.
  There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U is mentioned in chapter 3. 

Process of elimination:
  We know that U is mentioned in chapter 3. 
  According to the clues, X must be in chapter 2 or 4.
  But since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, X must be in chapter 4.
  Now, according to the rules, T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating them. 
  This means T must be in chapter 1, 2, or 3. But since U is already in chapter 3, T cannot be in chapter 3, so T must be in chapter 1 or 2.
  Furthermore, we know that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S and Z must be in chapters 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  Finally, we know that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, which means W must be in chapter 6 or 7.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 1. This is possible because R can be in any of the remaining chapters (excluding 3 and 4).
B: R is mentioned in chapter 5. This is also possible because R can be in any of the remaining chapters (excluding 3 and 4).
C: S is mentioned in chapter 7. This is possible according to the rules.
D: W is mentioned in chapter 6. This is possible because W can only be in chapter 6 or 7.
E: X is mentioned in chapter 4. This is not possible because we already determined that X must be in chapter 4.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is in exactly one chapter.
  - Chapters are numbered 1 through 7.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1.
  - T must be before W and separated by two chapters.
  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
    
Since U is mentioned in chapter 3 and U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, X must be in either chapter 2 or chapter 4. S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be in chapter 2 or chapter 4. This means that either S or Z must be in chapter 2, and the other must be in chapter 5, 6 or 7. 

This leaves only two possible options for the placement of T. Either T is in chapter 5 and W is in chapter 7, or T is in chapter 6 and W is in chapter 4.

If T is in chapter 5, then R cannot be in chapter 5 or chapter 7 due to the constraint that S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters. If T is in chapter 6, then R cannot be in chapter 1, 2, 6 or 7. This leaves only chapter 5 for R. Neither W nor X can be in chapter 5, so W must be in chapter 7 and X must be in chapter 6. 

Therefore, the only option that could be true is: Answer("D") W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Seven clues, R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z are mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  Action: 
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, there are some restrictions on placement of other clues:
  - T cannot be in Chapter 1, so it can only be in Chapter 2 or Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 or Chapter 6 or Chapter 7.
  - By the rule of separation, T cannot be in Chapter 2 and Chapter 4, because that would put T and W too close to each other. The minimum separation between T and W is two chapters.
  - Therefore, T can be in Chapter 5 or 6 or 7.
  - By the rule of adjacency, U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X must be in Chapter 4 or Chapter 6.
  - By the rule of adjacency, W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X cannot be in Chapter 6, which means it must be in Chapter 4.
  - Therefore, W must be in Chapter 6 and T must be in Chapter 5.
  - By the rule of separation, S cannot be in Chapter 6 or Chapter 7. So S must be in Chapter 1 or Chapter 2 or Chapter 3 or Chapter 4.
  - By the rule of adjacency, S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters. Therefore, Z cannot be in Chapter 2 or Chapter 3. So Z must be in Chapter 5 or Chapter 6 or Chapter 7.
  
  Now we can check the options:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1. This is possible. 
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5. This is possible.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7. This is not possible as S can only be in Chapter 1 or Chapter 2 or Chapter 3 or Chapter 4.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6. This is possible.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4. This is already found to be true.
  
  Answer: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The mystery novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  - Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Answering each choice: 
  A: If R is mentioned in chapter 1, there will be no place to fit T since T cannot be in chapter 1. This choice is not possible.
  B: If R is mentioned in chapter 5, T must be in either chapter 2 or 3 (since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.) Thus, X will be in either chapter 4 or 6 (since U is mentioned in chapter 3, and U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.) S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, so they must be in chapters 2, 4, 6, or 7, and W will be in the remaining chapter. This choice is possible.
  C: If S is mentioned in chapter 7, Z cannot be in chapter 6, and T must be mentioned before W, which leaves only chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 available for T, W, X, and Z. But since Z is after S, it cannot be in chapter 6. Thus, there is no place to fit all clues in the given constraints. This choice is not possible.
  D: If W is mentioned in chapter 6, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, X must be mentioned in chapter 7, and U must be mentioned in chapter 5. R and Z must then be in chapters 1 and 2, in some order, and S must be in chapter 4 or 5. But if S is in chapter 5, then there is no place to fit U and X, since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Thus, this choice is not possible.
  E: If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then U must be in chapter 3, T must be in chapter 5, W must be in chapter 7, and S, R, and Z must be in chapters 1, 2, and 6, in some order. This choice is possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - A total of 7 clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue must appear exactly once, one per chapter from chapter 1 to chapter 7.
  - Constraints:
    - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
    - T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating their mentions.
    - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    
To solve the question, we can start with the given information that U is mentioned in chapter 3, and then look at each answer option and see if it could be true based on the constraints given.

Analysis:
- Option A: If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, leaving no place for U and violating the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, option A is not possible.
- Option B: If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then S and Z must be split between chapters 4 and 6. This is possible, as long as T appears before W in chapter 2, U is mentioned in chapter 3, and the other clues are assigned accordingly. Therefore, option B is possible.
- Option C: If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5, leaving no place for W and violating the constraint that T must appear before W with exactly two chapters separating them. Therefore, option C is not possible.
- Option D: If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, Z must be mentioned in chapter 4, and U must be mentioned in chapter 3, leaving no place for X and violating the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, option D is not possible.
- Option E: If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then U must be mentioned in chapter 3 and W must be mentioned in chapter 7. Then, T can be mentioned in chapter 2, S and Z can be split between chapters 1 and 5, and R can be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, option E is possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven chapters, and seven clues to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - Since U is mentioned in chapter 3, T cannot be in chapter 1, and W cannot be in chapter 4 or 5. Therefore, based on the constraint that says T must be mentioned before W, T and W must be in chapters 2 and 6, in some order.
  - U and X must be in adjacent chapters, so U is in chapter 3 and X is either in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither can be in chapter 6, which means one must be in chapter 7 and the other in chapter 5. 
  - R can be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5, and R cannot be in chapter 6 since that is where W is mentioned.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T and W can be mentioned in chapter 2 and 6 in some order that satisfies the constraint, and S and Z can be in chapters 3 and 7. X can be in chapter 2 if it was not mentioned in chapter 4 as required.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. The clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z are mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  2. T cannot be in chapter 1.
  3. T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T and W.
  4. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  5. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  6. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

To be true, we must be able to fit the other six clues into the remaining five chapters, observing all six constraints given above. 

Let us consider each option and see if it is possible or not: 
  A: If R is in chapter 1, then T cannot be in chapter 2, leaving T to be in chapter 3 or 4, which would break the constraint that T must be separated from W by exactly two chapters. Therefore, R cannot be in chapter 1. 
  B: If R is in chapter 5, then T must be in chapter 3 or 4, which satisfies the requirement that T must be separated from W by at least two chapters. It is also possible to place the remaining clues while satisfying the other constraints. Therefore, it is possible that R is in chapter 5 if U is in chapter 3. 
  C: If S is in chapter 7, then Z must be in chapter 6, which means that W must be in chapter 4 or 5. But if W is in chapter 4 or 5, then it is not possible to place T and X in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be in chapter 7. 
  D: If W is in chapter 6, then T must be in chapter 3 or 4, which satisfies the requirement that T must be separated from W by at least two chapters. It is also possible to place the remaining clues while satisfying the other constraints. Therefore, it is possible that W is in chapter 6 if U is in chapter 3. 
  E: If X is in chapter 4, then U must be in chapter 3 and W must be in chapter 6. But if W is in chapter 6, then it is not possible to place T and X in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X cannot be in chapter 4. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The novel has 7 chapters and mentions 7 clues exactly once.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Solution:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Since there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, and T must be mentioned before W, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so T must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, which means S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 7. This leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 1, and X to be mentioned in chapter 4, which satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the answer is A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The novel consists of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  - Seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - There are a number of constraints that limit the order in which the clues can be mentioned.
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be in either chapter 2 or 4.
 
The only constraints which are relevant to this question are that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, if U is in chapter 3, then X can only be in chapter 2 or 4.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue will be assigned to one chapter, and each chapter will have one clue.
  - The clues must be ordered according to the following constraints:
    - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
    - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
    - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U is mentioned in chapter 3.
  
Analysis:
  - From the order constraints, we know that T must be mentioned in either Chapter 2 or Chapter 4.
  - Since U is mentioned in Chapter 3 and U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, we know that X must be mentioned in Chapter 2 or Chapter 4.
  - From the order constraints, we know that W must be mentioned in either Chapter 5 or Chapter 7.
  - From the order constraints, we know that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S and Z cannot be mentioned in Chapter 6 or Chapter 7.
  - If R is mentioned in Chapter 1, then W must be mentioned in Chapter 6 or Chapter 7, which violates the constraint that T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating them.
  - If R is mentioned in Chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in Chapter 7 and T in Chapter 2, which satisfies all the constraints.
  - If S is mentioned in Chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in Chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - If W is mentioned in Chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in Chapter 2 and R in Chapter 5, which satisfies all the constraints.
  - If X is mentioned in Chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in Chapter 2 and R in Chapter 5, which satisfies all the constraints.
  
Action: Answer("B") - R is mentioned in chapter 5.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are five students who review Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation plays.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Eliminating choices:
  A: Jiang reviews at least one play, but neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews; so this is not possible.
  B: This is possible since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  C: Megregian must review all the three plays since both Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian; so this is not possible.
  D: This is not possible since Megregian must review all the three plays.
  E: This is not possible since Megregian must review all the three plays.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  3. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  4. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
Based on the rules, we can eliminate some choices:
  - Choice A: Jiang cannot review Tamerlane as none of Lopez or Megregian reviews any play reviewed by Jiang.
  - Choice E: It is not possible for Lopez, Megregian and O'Neill to have reviewed exactly the same play or plays, as then there would be 3 students who reviewed the same play which is against the rules.
  
Now we are left with the following choices:
  - Choice B: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. But we don't know if exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Choice C: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Kramer and Lopez review less plays than Megregian. And three students review the same play or plays as each other.
  - Choice D: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. And three students review the same play or plays as each other.
  
Both choices C and D have the same group of students that review Tamerlane. 
Since choice C explicitly says that three students review the same play or plays as each other, while that's not mentioned in choice D, we will go with choice D as the answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  There are three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Lopez and Megregian do not review any play that Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Two of the students review the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  From the given statements, we can infer that at least two students review Tamerlane. So, options A and E can be eliminated.
  Also, Megregian does not review any of the plays that Jiang reviews. So, option D can also be eliminated.
  According to the given statements, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, the correct answer must have Kramer and O'Neill in it. Further, if we take option C, then it would mean that Lopez and Megregian would have to review the same play which contradicts one of the given conditions. Hence, the correct answer is option B: Kramer, O'Neill. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill
  They review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

To find out which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane, we need to look for the options that include Kramer and O'Neill, since they both review Tamerlane. We also know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so they cannot review Tamerlane. Therefore, the possible options are A, B, and C.

Option A includes only Jiang and Kramer, but we know that O'Neill also reviews Tamerlane, so option A is not correct.

Option B includes Kramer and O'Neill, which is correct.

Option C includes Kramer, Lopez, and O'Neill, but we know that Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, and Megregian does not review Tamerlane, so this option is not correct.

Options D and E do not include Kramer, which is necessary for a complete and accurate list of the students who review Tamerlane.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A is incorrect because Jiang doesn't review any play reviewed by Kramer according to the third condition.
  - Choice C is incorrect because Lopez doesn't review Tamerlane and thus it violates the first condition.
  - Choice D is incorrect because Megregian doesn't review Tamerlane according to the second condition.
  - Choice E is incorrect because Lopez doesn't review Tamerlane according to the first condition.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

The correct answer is B because it satisfies all the conditions and states that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews. 
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Analysis:
  - Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, options D and E are incorrect since they don't include O'Neill.
  - Option A is incorrect because Kramer and Jiang can't both review Tamerlane.
  - Option B is possible since both Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane. But we need to verify if any of the other students reviewed the same play(s) as them.
  - Option C is not possible because Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane which means neither of them can review more plays than Megregian. So if both Kramer and Lopez review Tamerlane, then Megregian can't review a third play which is a contradiction.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.

Observation:
- Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, then the only way for exactly two students to review the same play or plays as each other is for either Kramer or O'Neill to be paired with Megregian.

Actions: 
- Checking the given choices:
  - A: Jiang reviewed no play that is also reviewed by Kramer (from the second observation). It's incorrect because it does not include O'Neill who also reviewed Tamerlane (from the first observation).
  - B: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane (from the first observation). It's a possible answer, but it could be too early to decide without checking the other choices.
  - C: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane (from the first observation), but it also includes Lopez (from the first observation). Thus, it's incorrect because it includes more than two students.
  - D: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane (from the first observation). Megregian is the only student who hasn't been paired with any other student yet. Thus, it could be a possible answer. It's similar to choice B, but it includes Megregian instead of being a single pair.
  - E: It includes Megregian and O'Neill, who both reviewed Tamerlane, but it also includes Lopez (from the first observation). Thus, it's incorrect because it includes more than two students.

Therefore, the answer is D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Each of the five students reviews one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays.

Let's examine each option:
  A: Jiang and Kramer are the only ones who review Tamerlane. However, the condition "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other" is not met.
  B: Kramer and O'Neill are the two students who review Tamerlane, which satisfies the condition "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other."
  C: Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, but Lopez reviews fewer plays than Kramer and should not review Tamerlane according to the conditions given.
  D: Megregian reviews fewer plays than Kramer and should not review Tamerlane according to the conditions given.
  E: Lopez and O'Neill cannot both review Tamerlane because both of them review fewer plays than Megregian, and Megregian cannot review Tamerlane. 

Therefore, the only option that meets all of the given conditions is:
Action:Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. 
  Also, neither Megregian nor Lopez review any play reviewed by Jiang.
  Thus, Jiang can only review Sunset or Undulation. 
  We also know that exactly two students review the same play or plays, and we already have two students, Kramer and O'Neill, who reviewed Tamerlane.

Action: Answer("B") 
  The only possible pair of students who reviewed the same play are Kramer and O'Neill. 
  Thus, the answer is (B) Kramer, O'Neill.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.
- Exactly two out of the five students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
- Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.

We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they have to be in the list of students who review Tamerlane. Also, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang is not on the list. Furthermore, we know that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other, so our list should include two or three students.

Analysis:
- A does not include O'Neill, so it's incorrect.
- B includes Kramer and O'Neill, which is correct.
- C includes Kramer and O'Neill, but also adds Lopez which is not necessary since it's a list of students who review Tamerlane only.
- D includes Kramer and O'Neill, but also adds Megregian which is not necessary since it's a list of students who review Tamerlane only.
- E includes O'Neill and Megregian, but not Kramer, so it's incorrect.

Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The organizer must select at least 5 works and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works.
  The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play.
  The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: 
    - No more than four French works are selected.
    - At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
    - At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.

    - The maximum number of French works that can be selected is 4.
  - At least three but no more than four novels are selected:
    - The minimum number of novels that can be selected is 3. 
    - The maximum number of novels that can be selected is 4.
  - At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected: 
    - The number of French novels selected must be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels selected.
  - If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected: 
    - Only one French play can be selected.

Analysis:
  - A: This choice requires to select one French novel and one French play which contradicts the requirement that only one French play can be selected.
  - B: This choice requires to select one French novel and one Russian play which violates the requirement of having at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

  - D: This choice suggests selecting two French novels which fulfills all the requirements.
  - E: This choice suggests selecting two Russian novels which will violate the requirement of having at least as many French novels as Russian novels. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The group of works consists of:
    - 3 French novels
    - 3 Russian novels
    - 2 French plays
    - 1 Russian play
  - At least three but no more than four novels must be selected.
  - No more than four French works are selected.
  - At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  - If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
  
Analysis:
  - We need to select at least 5 works and at most 6 works from the group.
  - We must select:
    - At least three but no more than four novels. Therefore, we must select 3 or 4 novels from the total of 6 novels.
    - No more than four French works. We have three French novels and two French plays, so we can select at most 4 French works, but we need to make sure that we don't select more than 3 French novels.
    - At least as many French novels as Russian novels. This means that if we select 3 novels, we need to select at least 2 French novels and 1 Russian novel. If we select 4 novels, we need to select at least 2 French novels and 2 Russian novels.
    - If both French plays are selected, then we cannot select the Russian play. So, we need to be careful when selecting the French plays.
    
Solution:
  - We can select 3 novels from the total of 6 novels. This means that we can select either 1 French novel, 1 Russian novel, and 1 other novel, or 2 French novels, 1 Russian novel, and 1 other novel. If we select 4 novels, we can select 2 French novels, 2 Russian novels, and no other novel.
  - If we select 3 novels, we need to make sure that we select at least 2 French novels and 1 Russian novel. If we select 4 novels, we need to make sure that we select at least 2 French novels and 2 Russian novels.
  - We can select at most 4 French works, but we need to make sure that we don't select more than 3 French novels.
  - If we select both French plays, we cannot select the Russian play.
  
Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that we must select at least two French novels, and we can select either one French play and one Russian novel or one French novel and one French play. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The group of works consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
- The organizer must select at least 5 and at most 6 works.
- No more than 4 French works are selected.
- At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Analysis:
To satisfy the conditions, the organizer must select at least 3 novels, which means that the organizer cannot select only one novel. Also, at least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected, so there must be either 2 French novels and 2 Russian novels or 3 French novels and 3 Russian novels. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play cannot be selected, which means that only one French play can be selected.

Action: Answer("A")  
Therefore, the organizer must at least select one French novel (because there must be at least as many French novels as Russian novels) and one French play (because only one French play can be selected if both French plays are not selected).
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The organizer must select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9.
  The group includes:
    - 3 French novels
    - 3 Russian novels
    - 2 French plays
    - 1 Russian play
  No more than 4 French works can be selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Analysis:
  To satisfy the requirements, the organizer must select at least:
  - 1 French novel (because at least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected and there are 3 Russian novels)
  - 1 Russian novel (because at least 3 novels must be selected and there are 3 French novels)
  - 1 French play (because if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected)
  This makes a total of 3 works selected. To select more works, we have two cases:
  - If the organizer selects 1 French novel, 1 Russian novel, and both French plays, then the requirements are fully satisfied, and a total of 4 works are selected.
  - If the organizer selects 2 French novels and 1 Russian novel, then the requirements are fully satisfied, and a total of 4 works are selected.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The organizer must select at least 5 works and at most 6 from a group of 9 works: 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
  No more than four French works are to be selected.
  At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Action: Answer("D")  
Reasoning: 
  To satisfy the first condition, we can select at most 4 French works, which means we must select at least 1 Russian play or 1 Russian novel.
  To satisfy the second condition, we must select at least 3 novels. Since there are only 6 possible works selected, we cannot select more than 3 novels. Therefore, we must select exactly 3 novels (either all French or 2 French and 1 Russian).
  To satisfy the third condition, we must select at least as many French novels as Russian novels. Since we must select exactly 3 novels, we can select either all 3 French novels or 2 French novels and 1 Russian novel.
  Finally, to satisfy the fourth condition, we must not select both French plays. Therefore, we can select at most 1 French play. 
  In summary, to satisfy all the conditions, the organizer must select 2 French novels, 1 Russian novel, 1 French play, and 1 Russian play. This is 5 works in total, which is the minimum number of works required. Therefore, the answer is D: two French novels.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- At least 5 and at most 6 works from 9 works must be selected.
- The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
- No more than 4 French works are selected.
- At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Analysis:
- At least three novels must be selected. This means that either three Russian novels or two French novels and one Russian novel must be selected.
- French novels must be either two or three. If it is two, then one or both French plays must be selected. However, this violates the condition that the same French plays cannot be selected with the Russian play. Therefore, three French novels must be selected.
- Since at least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected, three Russian novels must be selected as well.
- Finally, since three French novels and three Russian novels are already chosen, the final work can be either a French play or a Russian play.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- The organizer will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works consisting of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
- No more than four French works are selected.
- At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Analysis: 
- The minimum number of works that the organizer must select is five.
- Since the organizer must select at least three novels and no more than four novels, we know the organizer will select either three or four novels.
- Since at least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected, if three novels are selected it must be two French novels and one Russian novel. If four novels are selected, it must be two French novels and two Russian novels.
- Since no more than four French works are selected, there can be at most two French plays. 
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Action: Answer("A")  
- The organizer must select one French novel and one French play. 
- If three novels are selected, the third novel must be a Russian novel. 
- Since no more than four French works are selected, the organizer must select at most one more French work. If so, it cannot be another French play (otherwise, the Russian play will be selected).
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The organizer must select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works, which consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
- No more than 4 French works are selected, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Option Analysis:
- A: It's possible that the organizer could select one French novel and one French play, but there are no requirements that they must.
- B: It's possible that the organizer could select one French novel and one Russian play, but there are no requirements that they must.
- C: It's possible that the organizer could select one Russian novel and one French play, but there are no requirements that they must.
- D: The organizer must select at least one French novel, but they must select no more than four French works. Selecting only two French novels would still leave the possibility of selecting two French plays and one Russian novel, which would be a valid combination. However, it is also possible to select more than two French novels if fewer than three French works overall are selected.
- E: The organizer must select at least one Russian novel, but they could select either one or two, depending on the other selections.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The organizer must select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. 
  The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. 
  No more than four French works are selected. 
  At least three but no more than four novels are selected. 
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. 
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Solution:
  The organizer can select at most four French works. 
  The organizer must select at least three but no more than four novels. 
  Since there are three French novels and three Russian novels, the organizer must select at least two French novels.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected. Therefore, if the organizer selects one French play, they must select the Russian play.
  The organizer can select at most one French play, so either one French novel or one French play can be selected, but not both. 

Action: Answer("D")  
The organizer must select at least two French novels. Therefore, the best option is to select two French novels, two Russian novels, and one French play or one Russian play. Hence, the organizer must at least select two French novels.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3)
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2)
  Trustcorp owns King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2
  Trades can only be made between buildings of the same class or with specific combinations.
  We need to determine if there is a trade that could result in each situation.

Process of elimination:
  A: RealProp cannot own Flores Tower because it is a class 1 building and neither Yates House nor Zimmer House are class 1. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  B: This could be true if a trade occurs where Southco trades Lynch Building (class 2) for Trustcorp's Meyer Building (class 2).
  C: This could be true if a trade occurs where RealProp trades Yates House (class 3) for Southco's Lynch Building (class 2).
  D: Trustcorp owns neither Flores Tower (class 1) nor Ortiz Building (class 3). Therefore, this cannot be true.
  E: RealProp cannot own Meyer Building because it is a class 2 building and neither Yates House nor Zimmer House are class 2. Therefore, this cannot be true.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class; Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings; Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  
A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower. This is not possible since RealProp only owns one class 1 building which is the Garza Tower.
B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building. This is not possible since Southco only owns one class 1 building which is the Flores Tower and Meyer Building is a class 2 building.
C: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. This is not possible since Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and Lynch Building is already owned by Southco.
D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building. This is not possible since Flores Tower is already owned by Southco.
E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. This is possible since both Garza Tower and Meyer Building are class 2 buildings that are owned by different companies.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  
  Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
  Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.

Solution:
  A: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco and it is class 1, so RealProp cannot own the Flores Tower. A cannot be true.
  B: The Flores Tower is class 1 and Meyer Building is class 2, so Southco cannot own the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building at the same time. B cannot be true.
  C: The Garza Tower is class 1, so Southco cannot own the Garza Tower, and Lynch Building is class 2, so RealProp cannot own Lynch Building. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: Flores Tower is class 1 and Ortiz Building is class 2, so Trustcorp cannot own the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building at the same time. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  E: Garza Tower is class 1, and Meyer Building is class 2, so RealProp cannot own the Garza Tower, and Trustcorp cannot own the Meyer Building. Therefore, E cannot be true.
  
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - RealProp owns buildings in class 1, 3 and 3.
  - Southco owns buildings in class 1 and 2.
  - Trustcorp owns building in class 2.
  - The trades can only be made among buildings of the same class or as per the given three kinds of trades.
  - We have to determine which option is not possible.
 
Analysis:
  - We know that all the buildings in class 1 have already been traded and all the class 3 buildings belong to RealProp.
  - Therefore, RealProp cannot own the Flores Tower or the Lynch Building.
  - Southco cannot own the Garza Tower, the Yates House, or the Zimmer House.
  - Trustcorp cannot own the Garza Tower or the Yates House.
  - Using these facts, we can now eliminate the options that are not possible.
 
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, so option A is not possible.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
   1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
   2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
   3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Logic: 
  If we can determine which buildings belong to which company, we can determine if any of the given statements are false.
  RealProp owns only one class 1 building and Southco owns only one class 1 building. Therefore, statement A cannot be true. 
  To make statement B true, Southco would need to own the Meyer Building. However, the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, so statement B is false.
  To make statement C true, Southco would need to own the Garza Tower. However, the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, so statement C is false.
  Statement D is false because the Flores Tower is owned by Southco not Trustcorp.
  Statement E is false because the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp not Trustcorp.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, a class 3 building, and another class 3 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Trades must be of exactly one of three given forms.

Solution:
  Choice A: RealProp cannot own the Flores Tower (class 1), because it is owned by Southco.
  Choice B: Possible. The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, and the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp.
  Choice C: Possible. The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, and the Lynch Building is owned by Southco.
  Choice D: Possible. The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, and the Ortiz Building is owned by Trustcorp.
  Choice E: RealProp cannot own the Meyer Building (class 2), because it is owned by Trustcorp.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Trades can only happen between buildings of the same class or in a specific set of trades mentioned in the question.
  
Option Analysis:
  A: RealProp does not own the Flores Tower.
  B: Southco must own Flores Tower, so this option is incorrect.
  C: Southco must own Garza Tower, so this option is incorrect.
  D: Trustcorp does not own the Flores Tower.
  E: Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings    
Solution:
  If RealProp owns the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower, then Southco must own Yates House and Zimmer House, which are both Class 3 buildings. To make this happen, Southco would need to trade the Flores Tower for two Class 3 buildings, which is not allowed. Therefore, this scenario is impossible, making option A incorrect.
  If Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building, then Trustcorp must own the Lynch Building and either the Yates House or the Zimmer House. The only way to get a Class 3 building from RealProp is to trade a Class 1 building and the only Class 1 building that Trustcorp does not own is Garza Tower. In this scenario, there is no way for Trustcorp to acquire Garza Tower, so option B is incorrect.
  If Southco owns the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, then Trustcorp must own the Yates House, Zimmer House, and either the King Building or the Ortiz Building. The only way to acquire a Class 1 building is to trade two Class 2 buildings, but there is no way for Trustcorp to then acquire a second Class 1 building to trade for Garza Tower. Therefore, option C is incorrect.
  If Trustcorp owns the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building, then Southco must own the Yates House, Zimmer House, the Garza Tower, the Lynch Building, and the King Building. There is no way to make this happen with the available trades, so option D is incorrect.
  If Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building, then RealProp must own the Flores Tower and either the Lynch Building or the King Building. To get a Class 3 building from Southco, RealProp would have to trade a Class 1 building. But since Trustcorp already owns both other Class 1 buildings, it cannot make this trade. Therefore, option E is incorrect.
 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns class 1, 3, and 3.
  Southco owns class 1 and 2.
  Trustcorp owns class 2, 2, and 2.
  Trades can only happen within the same class or with the stated exceptions.

Solution:
  A: RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1) and Yates and Zimmer Houses (both class 3). This statement is not possible because RealProp owns no class 2 buildings to trade for the Flores Tower owned by Southco.
  B: Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2). This statement is possible because Trustcorp owns Meyer Building (class 2), which they can trade for the Flores Tower.
  C: Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2). This statement is not possible because RealProp owns no class 2 buildings to trade for Lynch Building.
  D: Trustcorp owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Ortiz Building (class 2). This statement is not possible because Southco owns no class 3 buildings to trade for two class 2 buildings.
  E: Trustcorp owns Garza Tower (class 1) and Meyer Building (class 2). This statement is possible because RealProp owns Yates House (class 3) which they can trade for two class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - RealProp owns three buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  - Southco owns two buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  - Trustcorp owns three buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  - The three companies only trade buildings with each other.
  - Trades must be of exactly one of three kinds:
    * Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    * Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    * Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  - If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it can only receive two buildings of class 1 or one building of class 2 and one building of class 3.
  - If RealProp trades the Yates House or the Zimmer House, it can only receive two buildings of class 3 or one building of class 2 and one building of class 1.
  - If Southco trades the Flores Tower, it can only receive two buildings of class 2 or one building of class 1 and one building of class 3.
  - If Southco trades the Lynch Building, it can only receive two buildings of class 3 or one building of class 1 and one building of class 2.
  - If Trustcorp trades the King Building or the Meyer Building, it can only receive two buildings of class 3 or one building of class 2 and one building of class 1.
  - If Trustcorp trades the Ortiz Building, it can only receive two buildings of class 2 or one building of class 1 and one building of class 3.
  - Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, C, D and E as they are all possible through different trades.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Five witnesses must testify over three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Each witness testifies once and exactly once.
  3. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  4. Hong cannot testify on Monday.
  5. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday.
  6. Two witnesses need to testify on Tuesday.
  7. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Garcia cannot testify on that day. Also, since Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, we need to assign Garcia to either Monday or Tuesday for the schedule to work. However, one of those two days must have two witnesses so it cannot be Monday, therefore Garcia must be assigned to Tuesday. Hong cannot be on Monday, so Hong must be assigned to Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must be on Monday and the other witness on Tuesday with Iturbe on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  1. If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on the same day as Franco. Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco and Hong cannot testify on Wednesday.
  3. At least one witness testifies on Monday, so there are two possibilities: Franco testifies on Monday or a witness other than Franco, Hong or Iturbe testifies on Monday.
  4. Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, and we already know that Franco, Garcia, Hong, and Iturbe cannot testify on Tuesday, the only witness left is Jackson.
  5. Since Hong cannot testify on Monday, and Franco cannot testify on Tuesday or Wednesday if Hong testifies on the same day, the only possibility is that Franco testifies on Monday, and Hong testifies on Tuesday. Garcia must testify on Wednesday, and Iturbe testifies on Wednesday as well.
  
Conclusion:
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then "Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday". Therefore, the answer is (C) Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday.
We know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Hong cannot testify on Wednesday, which means Hong must testify on Tuesday. 
According to condition 3, there must be exactly two witnesses testifying on Tuesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday because Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco. This means that Garcia must testify on Wednesday.
Therefore, the only true statement is that Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. Out of five witnesses - Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson, the testimony of each witness must fall on exactly one out of three days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  2. Exactly two witnesses must give testimony on Tuesday.
  3. Iturbe will testify only on Wednesday.
  4. Franco can’t testify on the same day as Garcia, and Hong can’t testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness will testify on Monday.
  
Reasoning:
  - Franco cannot testify on the same day as Hong. Therefore, Hong will not testify on Monday because there must be at least one witness who testifies on Monday.
  - From condition 3, we know that Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco and Hong will testify on either Monday or Tuesday.
  - From condition 1, we know that Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. Thus, Garcia must testify on Monday together with either Franco or Hong.
  - Since Hong cannot testify on Monday, Franco will testify with Garcia on Monday, and Hong will testify with Jackson on Tuesday.
  - Thus, from condition 2, Iturbe will testify alone on Wednesday.
  - Therefore, the answer must be D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing is three days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day.
  Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must testify on Monday together. Since Hong does not testify on Monday, it means Franco will not testify on the same day as Hong. Thus, this situation cannot happen and none of the choices is correct.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is 3 days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  - If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday since Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Hong must testify on Tuesday to satisfy the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. However, this would mean that Franco and Hong testify on different days, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, A is not true.
  - If Garcia testifies on Monday, then Franco cannot testify on Monday, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, B is not true.
  - If Garcia testifies on Wednesday, then Franco must testify on Tuesday to satisfy the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. However, this would mean that Franco and Garcia testify on the same day, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, C is not true.
  - If Hong testifies on Tuesday, then Franco must testify on Wednesday to satisfy the condition that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. However, this would mean that Franco and Hong testify on different days, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, D is not true.
  - Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, so E is not true.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing lasts exactly 3 days, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, it means that Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco or Hong (due to the condition that Franco and Garcia cannot testify together). 
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Hong cannot testify on Tuesday, which means that Hong has to testify on Wednesday. 
  Since only two witnesses can testify on Tuesday, and Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco or Hong, then Garcia must testify on Monday with Franco. 
  This leaves Jackson to testify alone on Tuesday. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Five witnesses--Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is to take place on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.

Since the question says that Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, and since Hong does not testify on Monday, then Franco must testify either on Tuesday or Wednesday.  But since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, then Franco must testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Garcia will have to testify on Monday since Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. So the answer is B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
- The hearing is exactly 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
- Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least 1 witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday because exactly 2 witnesses must testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Garcia must not testify on Tuesday and must testify on Monday or Wednesday. 

Knowledge:
- Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday.
- One of Garcia's testifying days is Tuesday. 
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. 

If Garcia were scheduled to testify on Wednesday, then there would be no available day left for Franco because Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, since at least 1 witness testifies on Monday and Franco cannot testify on Tuesday or Wednesday, Garcia must testify on Monday. 

Knowledge:
- Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday.
- Garcia must testify on Monday.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco and Hong are scheduled to testify on the same day, then we know that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on that day, so Garcia must testify on the remaining day (either Monday or Tuesday).

If Garcia testifies on Monday, then Hong must testify on Tuesday and there would be no possible day for Iturbe to testify since he can only testify on Wednesday. This is a contradiction, so we can eliminate choice B.

If Garcia testifies on Tuesday, then Hong cannot testify on Tuesday and must testify on Wednesday. This means only Franco can testify on Monday, leaving Iturbe to testify on Wednesday. This satisfies all of the conditions, so we have found a valid schedule.

Therefore, the only conclusion that we can draw is that Action: Answer("D") Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

  We need to find a possible order of the six auditions, given certain conditions.
  2 of the 6 auditions will be recorded: Kammer's and Lugo's auditions.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

  Among the remaining options, only answer choice D satisfies all conditions.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.

  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo. This option satisfies all the given rules.
  C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida. This option violates the rule that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida. This option violates the rule that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo. This option violates the rule that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Kammer and Lugo’s audition will be recorded. Other auditions will not be recorded.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Eliminating answer choices with violations of the rules, we are left with the following possible order of the auditions: 

  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
  
A violates the rule that the fifth audition must be recorded.
C violates the rule that the fourth audition cannot be recorded. 
D violates the rule that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
E violates the rule that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
    
A: Kammer's audition is first and Trillo's audition is second, which violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. 

B: Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, and the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, Waite's audition must be first, followed by Kammer's audition. Then, the fifth audition must be Yoshida's, followed by Zinn's audition. Finally, Lugo's audition is last and Trillo's audition is not fourth. Therefore, this could be a possible order.

C: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, Zinn's audition cannot be fourth, as it is later than Waite's audition and the two recorded auditions. Therefore, this is not a possible order.

D: The fifth audition must be recorded, so Yoshida's audition cannot be first or second. Therefore, this is not a possible order.

E: Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so this is not a possible order.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Eliminating the choices one by one:

  - Choice A: Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, but Trillo is before Kammer in the order proposed by this choice, so this choice is not valid.

  - Choice B: This order satisfies all of the conditions:
      - 1st: Waite (must take place earlier than the recorded auditions)
      - 2nd: Kammer (Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition)
      - 3rd: Yoshida (Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition and the 5th audition must be recorded)
      - 4th: Zinn (Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition)
      - 5th: Lugo (Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded)
      - 6th: Trillo (the 4th audition cannot be recorded)

  - Choice C: Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition must be recorded, so this choice is not valid because Lugo is not one of the first two auditions.

  - Choice D: The order proposed in this choice is not valid because the 5th audition must be recorded.

  - Choice E: The order proposed in this choice is not valid because Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
There are six auditions that are to take place in a specific order. 
Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded. 

Analysis:
From the conditions given, we know that:
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the four non-recorded auditions.
- The fifth audition must be recorded, so it cannot be Kammer or Lugo.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite must go before the fifth audition (the first to be recorded).
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer must go before Trillo.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn must go before Yoshida.

Looking at the answer choices:
- A: Kammer goes first, but the fourth audition cannot be recorded, so this is not possible.
- B: This order satisfies all the given conditions, so it is a possible order.
- C: Lugo's audition is second, but Lugo's audition must be recorded, so this is not possible.
- D: Zinn goes second, but Zinn's audition must go before Yoshida's audition, so this is not possible.
- E: This order does not satisfy the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded. This means that the fourth audition will be one of the four unrecorded auditions.
  The fifth audition must be recorded. This means that the recording of the fifth audition cannot happen before all the previous auditions are complete.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. This means that Waite's audition will happen before the fifth audition and the sixth audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. This means that Kammer's audition will happen before the third audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. This means Zinn's audition will happen before the sixth audition.
  
Analysis:
  Using the given conditions, we can determine the exact order of some auditions and narrow down the possible orders. For example, we know that:
    - The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so the fourth audition must be one of {Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, Zinn}.
    - The fifth audition must be recorded, so the fifth audition must be one of {Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida}.
    - Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either first or second.
    - Kammer's audition must take place before Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either first or second.
    - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be fourth or earlier.
    
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some options:
    - Option A: Kammer cannot be first because Waite's audition must be earlier than the recorded auditions. Lugo's audition is recorded, which means that Lugo's audition must be fifth. Therefore, option A is not possible.
    - Option B: This order satisfies all the given conditions and is a possible order.
    - Option C: This option is impossible because Waite's audition is third and it must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
    - Option D: Zinn's audition happens second and Zinn's audition must happen before Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Zinn's audition will not be followed by Yoshida's audition. Therefore, option D is not possible.
    - Option E: This option is impossible because Zinn's audition must happen sooner than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Zinn's audition cannot be last.
    
Conclusion:
  The only possible order is option B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  2. The fifth audition must be recorded.
  3. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  4. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  5. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Elimination:
  From condition 3, Waite's audition should happen first or second. So options C, D, and E can be eliminated.
  From condition 4, Kammer's audition will happen first or second. So option A can be eliminated.

Final analysis:
  We are left with option B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo. 
  This satisfies all the given conditions and is a possible order for the six auditions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
 
Eliminating choices based on the given rules:
  - Rule 4: Kammer before Trillo. This means option A is incorrect since Trillo is before Kammer.
  - Rule 5: Zinn before Yoshida. This means option B is incorrect since Yoshida is before Zinn.
  - Rule 6: Waite before the two recorded auditions. This means option C is incorrect since Kammer's audition is before Waite's.
 
Analysis of option D:
  - Waite is first as required by Rule 3.
  - Zinn is before the two recorded auditions, as required by Rule 6.
  - Kammer is before Trillo, as required by Rule 4.
  - Lugo is after the two recorded auditions, so she must be last, as required by Rule 2.
  - The only remaining spot is for Yoshida, so she must be fifth, which satisfies Rule 5.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A corporate manager is selecting employees for a research team. The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. The selection is constrained by the following conditions: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team?
Choices:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt
  B: Ortega and Wong
  C: Paine and Schmidt
  D: Thomson and Yoder
  E: Yoder and Zayre
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We need to select a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team. 
  If Myers on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. 
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. 
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Process of elimination: 
  A: If Ortega is on the team, according to the constraints, Schmidt cannot be on the team. Hence, it is not a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  B: If Wong is on the team, then Myers and Yoder must also be on the team, so Wong and Myers can be a pair at least one of whom must be on the team.
  C: If Schmidt is on the team, then Paine and Thomson must also be on the team, so Paine and Schmidt can be a pair at least one of whom must be on the team.
  D: If Thomson is on the team, it is not constrained that Yoder be on the team. Hence, it is not a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  E: If Yoder and Zayre are the pair, there is no constraint saying either Yoder or Zayre need to be on the team. Hence, it is not a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees but we don't know if all the eight employees will be considered.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  The question asks for a pair of employees that must be on the team. Based on the given constraints, we can eliminate some pairs:
  - Myers and Ortega or Paine cannot be on the team together.
  - Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must be on the team together.
  - Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team together.
  By process of elimination, we can determine that one of the pairs must be on the team.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  Based on the given constraints, the only remaining pair is Ortega and Wong. Therefore, we can conclude that at least one of them must be on the team. Thus, the correct answer is (B) Ortega and Wong.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The research team should include at least four employees of the eight given.
  - If Myers is on the team, then Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, then Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  - If Wong is on the team, then Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.

We are asked to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
If we look at the given conditions, we can see that Wong must be on the team along with Myers and Yoder.
That means Myers and Yoder are a pair of employees that must be on the team. 

So, the answer is:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The team will include at least four employees.
  - The team will be selected from eight employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
Action: 
  Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team.
  Wong and Myers are a pair and must both be on the team if one of them is.
  Therefore, Wong and Myers are the only pair of employees in the choices where at least one must be on the team. 
  Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The research team will include at least four employees.
  The team can be selected from among eight employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is selected, Ortega and Paine cannot be selected.
  If Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must be selected.
  If Wong is selected, both Myers and Yoder must be selected.
  
Analysis: 
  We need to find a pair of employees that must be on the team. 
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be selected. So, only one of them can be on the team if the other is not.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must be selected. Hence, Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson are a group of three employees that are always selected or not selected together.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must be selected. Hence, Wong, Myers, and Yoder are a group of three employees that are always selected or not selected together.
  There are no such conditions for the other employees.

Action: Answer("B")  
  Pair (Ortega and Wong) must be on the team because Wong must be selected if Myers and Yoder are selected, and Ortega must be on the team if Wong and Myers are not selected.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The team must include at least four employees from a total of eight possible employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must be on the team.
  If Wong is selected, both Myers and Yoder must be on the team.
  
  To answer the question, we need to find a pair of employees that must be on the team together, based on the given constraints.

Analysis:
  The only pair of employees that must be on the team together based on the constraints given is Wong and Myers. If Wong is on the team, then Myers must be on the team. And if Myers is on the team, then Wong must be on the team. Therefore, the answer is B: Ortega and Wong.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The team will include at least four employees from a total of eight employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  
Process of Elimination:
  A: If Schmidt is on the team, Paine must also be on the team. But if Paine is on the team, Myers and Yoder cannot be on the team because of Wong's constraint. So Schmidt, Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team together. Eliminate A.
  B: If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. So at least one of Ortega and Wong is on the team. Keep B.
  C: If Schmidt is on the team, Paine must also be on the team. But if Paine is on the team, Myers and Yoder cannot be on the team because of Wong's constraint. So Schmidt, Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team together. Eliminate C.
  D: If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. So at least one of Thomson and Yoder is on the team. Keep D.
  E: If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Neither Yoder nor Zayre are already included in the constraints, so at least one of them must be on the team. Keep E.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a pool of eight employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Solution:
  We need to find a pair of employees, at least one of whom must be on the team.
  If Ortega is on the team, Myers and Paine cannot be on the team. Furthermore, Ortega doesn't have any specific requirements to be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must be on the team. Therefore, Wong is not part of the solution.
  If Thomson is on the team, Schmidt and Paine must be on the team as well. Therefore,Thomson is not part of the solution.
  If Paine is on the team, Schmidt must be on the team as well, but it doesn't guarantee that any other member of the solution is on the team.
  If Schmidt and Myers are not on the team, there are no specific requirements for any member to be on the team.

Action: Answer("B")  
The pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Ortega and Wong.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The research team must include at least four employees from a group of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  - If Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team
  - If Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  - If Wong is selected, both Myers and Yoder must be on the team.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must be on the team. Therefore, if Yoder is not on the team, Myers must be on the team. This means that neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. If Ortega is not on the team, then Schmidt must not be on the team (because Schmidt requires both Paine and Thomson to be on the team). This leaves only Wong, Myers, Yoder, and Thomson. Therefore, the only possible pair of employees who must be on the team is Ortega and Wong. So, the correct answer is (B) Ortega and Wong.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
The team will include at least four employees from a pool of eight. 
If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must be on the team.
If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must be on the team. 

A: Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team. Schmidt and Ortega also cannot both be on the team. Therefore, this pair of employees cannot both be on the team.
B: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must be on the team. Therefore, either Ortega or Wong must be on the team.
C: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must be on the team. Therefore, either Paine and Schmidt must be on the team. 
D: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must be on the team. Therefore, either Yoder and Thomson must be on the team.
E: This pair of employees is not affected by the given constraints.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. So, one of these parking spaces must be assigned to Robertson.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. So, Togowa cannot get the highest-numbered parking space, and young cannot get the lowest two parking spaces.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Xu cannot get parking spaces #1 or #2.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  
Analysis: 
  Option A assigns the highest-numbered parking space to Young and the lowest-numbered parking space to Robertson. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. So, this option is not possible.
  Option B assigns parking space #1 to Vaughn, which is not possible since Robertson must be assigned one of the first four parking spaces. So, this option is not possible.
  Option C assigns the highest-numbered parking space to Xu. However, Xu cannot get parking spaces #1 or #2, so this option is not possible.
  Option D assigns parking space #2 to Robertson, which is possible according to the given rules. Also, Young gets a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Xu gets a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. So, this option is possible and could be a valid assignment of parking spaces to the new employees.
  Option E assigns parking space #1 to Souza, which is not possible since Robertson must be assigned one of the first four parking spaces. So, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
- Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
- Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
By applying the given rules, we can find that:
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, we know that Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.
- Since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, we know that Togowa must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Young must be assigned parking space #3 and #4.
- Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, we know that Souza must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Xu must be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
Therefore, the only possible assignment is:
#1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu.
Thus, Answer("D") is correct.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee should be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young's parking space number must be higher than Togowa's.
  Xu's parking space number must be higher than Souza's.
  Robertson's parking space number must be between 1 and 4, inclusive.
  
Analysis: 
  According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, options A, B, and E are eliminated since none of them assign Robertson to one of the first four parking spots. Then, option C assigns Togowa to parking space #1 and Young to parking space #2, which violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, the only possible answer is option D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: Six employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young) must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. 
  Young > Togowa
  Xu > Souza
  Robertson > Young
  Robertson in space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 

A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  1- Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson cannot be in space #4. The assignment is not possible.
B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  1- Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson cannot be in space #3, #2 or #1. The assignment is not possible.
C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  1- Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson can only be in space #4. Possible.
  2- Souza is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Souza cannot be in space #1. The assignment is not possible.
D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  1- Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson cannot be in space #3, #2 or #1. The assignment is not possible.
E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
  1- Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson can only be in space #4. Possible.
  2- Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu cannot be in space #5. The assignment is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  
  Based on the rules above, we can deduce the following:
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, but not #5 or #6.
  - If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4, and Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young (either #1, #2, or #3).
  - If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so if Xu is assigned parking space #6, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  Option A violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, because Togowa is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Option B violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, because Young is assigned parking space #3 while Robertson is assigned parking space #5.
  Option C violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, because Robertson is assigned parking space #5.
  Option D is a valid assignment of parking spaces since it satisfies all the given rules.
  Option E violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, because Souza is assigned parking space #1 while Xu is assigned parking space #5.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: 
    1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Six individuals need to be assigned the parking spaces.
 
Analysis:
  Using rule 4, we know that Robertson must be assigned one of parking spaces #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
  Using rule 3, we know that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. 
  Therefore, Robertson must be assigned either parking space #3 or #4.
  The remaining parking spaces for Robertson, Young, Togowa, and Xu are #1, #2, #5, and #6.
  Using rule 1, we know that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Using rule 2, we know that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Thus, we can exclude choices A, B, and E because they are inconsistent with these rules.
  Choice D satisfies all the given rules.
 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young and 6 parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young > Togowa
  - Xu > Souza
  - Robertson > Young
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Eliminating Options:
  - Option A: Young is in a higher numbered parking space than Togowa, which violates the rule.
  - Option B: Robertson is not assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, which violates the rule.
  - Option C: Xu is in a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which satisfies the rule.
  - Option D: Robertson is assigned parking space #2, which violates the rule.
  - Option E: Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which satisfies the rule, and Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which satisfies the rule.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 new employees and 6 parking spaces numbered 1 to 6.
  Each employee must be assigned a unique parking space.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
First, we know that Robertson has to be assigned a higher-numbered space, so he cannot be assigned space #5 or #6.
Second, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza, so Xu cannot be assigned space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned space #5 or #6.
Finally, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa, so Young cannot be assigned space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned space #5 or #6.

Option A: Togowa is assigned parking space #5 and Young is assigned parking space #1 which violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. 
Option B: Robertson is assigned parking space #5 which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Option C: This option does not violate any known rules.
Option D: This option does not violate any known rules.
Option E: Young is assigned parking space #3 which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  
Process of Elimination:
  - In option A, Young is assigned parking space #1, but Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so A is not possible.
  - In option B, Robertson is assigned parking space #5, but Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 so B is not possible.
  - In option C, Togowa is assigned parking space #1, but Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so C is not possible.
  - In option E, Souza is assigned parking space #1, but Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so E is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The first rule states that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  The second rule states that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  The third rule states that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Because there are six employees and six parking spaces, each space must be assigned to one employee.
  
Analysis: 
  According to the third rule, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, but Robertson must also be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. According to the first rule, Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Because Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and because parking space #6 is the only higher-numbered space available, Xu must be assigned parking space #6 and Souza must be assigned parking space #5. Finally, Vaughn must be assigned the only remaining parking space, which is parking space #4. 
  Therefore, the correct assignment of parking spaces is: 
  Togowa: #1, Souza: #5, Young: #6, Robertson: #2, Vaughn: #4, and Xu: #6.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We need to assign four students to the four years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. 
  If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned.
  If Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  We want to know which of the options could be true if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.

Analysis:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then we know that Ryan would have to be assigned to one of the years 1921, 1922, or 1923, and Yoshio would have to be assigned to one of the years 1922, 1923, or 1924. 
  Since Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1923, we know Louis would have to be assigned to that year if Tiffany is not assigned to the project.

Action: Answer("C")  
  If Ryan is assigned to 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which would be 1921. This means Mollie would have to be assigned to 1924, and Tiffany would not be assigned to the project. Therefore, Onyx could be assigned to 1922.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  1. Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  2. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  3. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  4. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Explanation:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, Tiffany cannot be assigned because of condition 3. That means Louis must be assigned to 1923 because of condition 1. If both Mollie and Onyx are not assigned, they will be left out of the project. From condition 4, Onyx must be assigned to the year before Ryan's. Therefore, if Yoshio is assigned to 1922, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921. Thus, the only option that could be true is that Yoshio is assigned to 1922. Option E is the correct answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. They cannot both be assigned to the same year.
  - If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned.
  - If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  - Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.

Solution: 
  - If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Onyx can be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1923.
  - Assigning Tiffany to 1923 would result in assigning Ryan to the project, which would mean Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This conflicts with the fact that there is only one student assigned to each year. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project.
  - Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923.
  - Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project and Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, A is not true.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, B could be true.
  - Onyx could be assigned to 1922, which is the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, C could be true.
  - Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1924. Therefore, D is not true.
  - Yoshio could be assigned to 1922. Therefore, E could be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. 
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project:

  - If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's; if Yoshio is also assigned, he cannot be in 1921 or 1922. Thus, Yoshio must be assigned to 1924.
  
    - If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned to the project; since he is already assigned, Tiffany must be assigned to another year. Thus, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923. 

    - If Mollie is assigned, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922; since Yoshio is assigned to 1924, Mollie cannot be assigned to either year. Thus, Mollie cannot be assigned to this project.

    - Louis is left, who can only be assigned to 1923. Thus, Louis must be assigned to 1923.
    
  - If Ryan is not assigned, then Onyx cannot be assigned either. In this case, Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922. Thus, Yoshio must be assigned to 1924. 

    - If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned to the project; since he is not assigned, Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. Thus, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.

    - If Mollie is assigned, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922; since Yoshio is assigned to 1924, Mollie cannot be assigned to either year. Thus, Mollie cannot be assigned to this project.

    - Louis is left, who can only be assigned to 1923. Thus, Louis must be assigned to 1923.
    
Therefore, it is possible that Louis is assigned to 1923 if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Applying the rules to the choices:
  A: Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Tiffany has to be assigned to 1923.
  B: If Mollie is assigned to 1921 or 1922, then Yoshio cannot be assigned to either of those years because there would be no year left for him. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921, and this choice is not valid.
  C: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then the only remaining year is 1922. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1921, and this choice is valid.
  D: If Tiffany is assigned to 1924, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1924, and this choice is not valid.
  E: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project and Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, then Yoshio must be assigned to 1923 and Ryan to 1924. Therefore, Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1922. Therefore, this choice is not valid.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project:
  - Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  - Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Ryan is assigned to the project.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
 
A: Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Ryan is assigned to the project.
B: If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, so she cannot be assigned to 1921 if Yoshio is assigned to the project.
C: Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, so he cannot be assigned to 1922 if Yoshio is assigned to the project.
D: Tiffany must be assigned to the project if Ryan is assigned to the project, so she cannot be assigned to 1924 if Yoshio is assigned to the project.
E: Yoshio can be assigned to 1922 since Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then we know there will not be any assignments to 1924 nor to 1922. 
  A: If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923. However, if Ryan and Yoshio are both assigned, then neither Tiffany nor Louis can be assigned to 1923.
  B: If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then there would not be any assignment available for Mollie's partner. This means that Mollie must be assigned to 1922 instead, which would leave 1921 available for Louis. But if Ryan and Yoshio are both assigned, then neither Louis nor Mollie can be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  C: Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. However, we know that Onyx cannot be assigned to 1924 nor to 1922. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1921. But if Ryan and Yoshio are both assigned, then Onyx cannot be assigned to any year.
  D: If Tiffany is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must also be assigned to the project. However, if Ryan and Yoshio are both assigned, then neither Tiffany nor Ryan can be assigned to 1924 nor to 1923.
  E: Yoshio can be assigned to 1923, which means that Tiffany must be assigned to 1922 and Ryan to 1921. This leaves Mollie and Louis available to be assigned to 1924 and 1921, respectively.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project then Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany must not be assigned because of the constraints of the project. 
  A: Louis cannot be assigned if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned because Louis was only assigned to 1923 if Tiffany is assigned to the project.
  B: Mollie cannot be assigned if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned because Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922 and those years are already assigned to Ryan and Yoshio, respectively.
  C: Onyx can be assigned to 1922 if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned because Onyx can take the year immediately prior to Ryan's which is 1922.
  D: Tiffany cannot be assigned if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned because Tiffany was only assigned if Ryan is assigned, and Ryan is already assigned.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922 if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned, which satisfies the constraint that each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, Tiffany must also be assigned to the project. If Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must also be assigned, which means Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This leaves only Louis and Mollie as choices for 1921 and 1922. Yoshio could be assigned to 1921 or 1924.

The only option that could be true is:

Action: Answer("E") Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then the years they must be assigned are either 1923 and 1922 or 1922 and 1921.
  A: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so Louis can't be assigned to 1923 if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
  B: If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. It is possible for Mollie to be assigned to 1921, so this choice could be true.
  C: If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. If Ryan is assigned to 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to 1921. So, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  D: If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to 1922, then Yoshio must be assigned to 1923, which means that Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.
  E: If Yoshio is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923. But if Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project, which would mean that Yoshio is not assigned to the project.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Julio leads Thursday afternoon session.
  Two lab assistants, Kevin and Rebecca, must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Two lab assistants, Lan and Olivia, cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Action: Answer("D")  
If Julio leads Thursday afternoon session, then Rebecca and Kevin must lead the Friday sessions (as they must lead sessions on the same day). Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa leads the Wednesday afternoon session. By the rule that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Julio cannot lead the Friday afternoon session. Therefore, Julio must lead the Wednesday morning session. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Olivia leads the Thursday morning session and Lan leads the Friday morning session. Therefore, for each of the six lab assistants except Nessa, we can determine which session they lead: Julio leads Wednesday morning, Julio leads Thursday afternoon, Rebecca leads Friday morning, Kevin leads Friday afternoon, Olivia leads Thursday morning, and Lan leads Friday morning. Hence, we can determine the session each of them leads except for Nessa. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are 6 lab sessions.
  2. There are 3 days with 2 sessions on each day.
  3. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant.
  4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  6. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  7. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we know that Olivia cannot be leading any session before Thursday afternoon due to constraint (7). Thus, Olivia must be leading a Friday session either in the morning or afternoon. And, due to constraint (5), Lan must be leading the other Friday session. 
  Therefore, we know:
  - Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  - Olivia and Lan lead the Friday sessions.
  - Nessa leads an afternoon session. There is only one afternoon session left and Nessa must lead it.
  
  Now the only undecided lab assistants are Kevin and Rebecca.
  Due to constraint (4), Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, so they both must lead sessions on Wednesday or they both must lead sessions on Friday. However, we do not have enough information to determine which one of the two days it is. Therefore, we can only determine the sessions for 2 of the remaining lab assistants, Kevin and Rebecca.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. The lab sessions are on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday and there is one morning and one afternoon session each day.
  2. The lab sessions are led by six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

To determine the answer, we can use the given information to create a chart of possible schedules for the lab sessions and note the possible lab assistants for each session.

|            | Wednesday Morning | Wednesday Afternoon | Thursday Morning | Thursday Afternoon | Friday Morning | Friday Afternoon |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Session 1  | Kevin, Rebecca   | Lan, Nessa          | Olivia, Julio    |                    | Rebecca, Kevin  | Lan, Nessa       |
| Session 2  | Lan, Nessa       | Kevin, Rebecca      | Julio, Olivia    |                    | Nessa, Lan      | Kevin, Rebecca   |
| Session 3  | Olivia, Julio    |                     | Rebecca, Kevin   | Nessa, Lan         |                | Olivia, Julio    |
| Session 4  | Rebecca, Kevin   |                     | Nessa, Lan       | Olivia, Julio      |                | Nessa, Lan       |
| Session 5  | Nessa, Lan       | Olivia, Julio       |                  | Kevin, Rebecca     | Julio, Olivia   | Rebecca, Kevin   |
| Session 6  | Julio, Olivia    | Nessa, Lan          |                  | Kevin, Rebecca     | Olivia, Julio   | Nessa, Lan       |

If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Friday sessions (either morning or afternoon) according to the first condition. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she leads the Wednesday or Friday afternoon session. From the third and sixth conditions, we know that Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's, so Olivia cannot lead the Friday afternoon session. Since Lan and Olivia cannot both lead the same day's session, Lan must lead the Wednesday afternoon session. This leaves the following possible lab assistant assignments:

|            | Wednesday Morning | Wednesday Afternoon | Thursday Morning | Thursday Afternoon | Friday Morning | Friday Afternoon |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Session 1  | Kevin, Rebecca   | Lan, Nessa          | Olivia, Julio    |                    | Rebecca, Kevin  | Lan, Nessa       |
| Session 2  | Lan, Nessa       | Kevin, Rebecca      | Julio, Olivia    |                    | Nessa, Lan      | Kevin, Rebecca   |
| Session 3  | Olivia, Julio    |                     | Rebecca, Kevin   | Nessa, Lan         |                | Olivia, Julio    |
| Session 4  | Rebecca, Kevin   |                     | Nessa, Lan       | Olivia, Julio      |                | Nessa, Lan       |

So, for the remaining lab assistants, we can determine the sessions they lead as follows:
- Lan and Nessa must lead the Wednesday sessions.
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Friday sessions.
- Olivia and Julio must lead the Thursday sessions.

Thus, we can determine the lab sessions for four of the lab assistants: Lan, Nessa, Kevin, and Rebecca. Answer: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are 6 lab sessions: Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning and Friday afternoon.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session:
- Kevin and Rebecca must be assigned to Wednesday or Friday.
- Lan and Olivia must be assigned to Wednesday and Friday, with Lan on Wednesday and Olivia on Friday.
- Nessa must be assigned to Friday afternoon.
- Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon, and the only remaining slots are Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning.

Therefore, we can determine what sessions for Kevin, Lan, Nessa, and Olivia. We cannot determine what sessions Rebecca will lead, so the answer is (D) four. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 6 lab assistants - Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are 6 lab sessions - 3 morning and 3 afternoon sessions, one on each of the three days of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Approach:
  Assuming Julio is leading the Thursday afternoon session, we can start by identifying which lab assistants cannot lead the remaining sessions based on the given constraints.
  We know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and since there is only one afternoon session left, we can conclude that Nessa will lead Friday afternoon session.
  We know that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Olivia cannot lead the remaining afternoon session on Wednesday. Therefore, Olivia must lead Wednesday morning session.
  We know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and there is only one morning session left on Friday, so Kevin and Rebecca must lead Friday morning session together.
  This leaves Lan to lead Thursday morning session.

Analysis:
  Based on the given constraints, we can determine which sessions four other lab assistants lead - Nessa (Friday afternoon), Olivia (Wednesday morning), Kevin & Rebecca (Friday morning). We cannot determine which sessions Lan will lead as there are two possibilities - Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning or Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. Therefore, the answer is D: four.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six assistants, which means each assistant will lead one session in either morning or afternoon, and each session has to be led by a different assistant.
  6. Julio leads Thursday afternoon session. 

Reasoning:
  Since Julio leads Thursday afternoon session, we can conclude that Olivia cannot lead Thursday afternoon session because of constraint (4) - "Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's". Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session (constraint 3), Nessa will lead Friday afternoon session. Therefore, either Kevin or Rebecca will lead Wednesday afternoon session (constraint 1). 
  Thus, we already know who is leading three sessions (Thursday afternoon - Julio, Friday afternoon - Nessa, and one session that either Kevin or Rebecca will lead). 
  Now, we use constraint 2: "Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day". Since Olivia cannot lead Thursday afternoon session, Olivia will lead either Wednesday morning or Friday morning. Then, either Lan or Kevin/Rebecca would lead the remaining morning session. Therefore, we can determine who is leading all six sessions.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are six lab sessions: three morning and three afternoon sessions held on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. 
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session:
  - Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - Nessa must lead either the Wednesday or Friday afternoon session.
  - Lan cannot lead the Wednesday or Thursday afternoon session because Olivia's session is on a later day than Julio's.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday and Friday morning sessions.

So, we know which sessions Kevin and Rebecca lead, and we can also determine which afternoon session Nessa leads. That's 3 lab assistants.
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are six lab sessions: three morning and three afternoon sessions, one on each day - Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then the assignments could be:
  Wednesday - morning: Nessa, afternoon: Kevin and Rebecca
  Thursday - morning: Olivia, afternoon: Julio
  Friday - morning: Lan, afternoon: any lab assistants except Nessa
  In this case, the only lab assistants who would be determined are (1) Nessa and (2) Olivia since they are assigned to specific days. All other lab assistants could be assigned to any of the remaining sessions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Reasoning: 
  Since Julio is leading the Thursday afternoon session and has to lead a session on an earlier day of the week than Olivia, we can determine that Julio leads on Wednesday morning. We know Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she has to lead on Thursday afternoon, meaning Rebecca and Kevin have to lead on Thursday as well. Since we know Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, this means that Olivia has to lead on Friday morning and Lan has to lead on Wednesday afternoon. This leaves only one available session for Rebecca, which is Friday afternoon. This makes it possible for us to determine the sessions led by all assistants.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  - The lab sessions are scheduled over three days, with one morning session and one afternoon session each day.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Based on the information provided, the following can be deduced:
  - Julio does not lead any other session.
  - Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon (the only afternoon session left).
  - This means that Lan's session must be on Wednesday morning, and Nessa's session must be on Thursday afternoon.
  - Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Wednesday and Thursday (in some order) in order to satisfy the requirement that they are on the same day. 
  
The only lab assistant left is Nessa, who must lead the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, for only one other lab assistant (Julio) can we determine which session they lead.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Each wall has 2 paintings (one oil and one watercolor).
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Based on the given conditions, we can deduce that:
- Greene's oil painting is not on the same wall as Franz's oil painting.
- Greene's oil painting is on the same wall as Hidalgo's watercolor painting.
- Isaacs's watercolor painting is not on wall 4.

Let's evaluate the answer choices:
A: Franz's watercolor painting could be on a wall with Greene's oil painting. This is possible.
B: Franz's watercolor painting and Hidalgo's oil painting cannot be on the same wall because no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
C: Greene's oil painting cannot be displayed in an upper position on any wall because Greene's watercolor painting is displayed in the upper position on the wall where Franz's oil painting is displayed.
D: Hidalgo's watercolor painting can be displayed in a lower position on any wall.
E: Isaacs's watercolor painting and Hidalgo's oil painting cannot be displayed on the same wall because no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
 
Therefore, the answer is C: Greene's oil painting is displayed in an upper position.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Each student will display exactly one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  Each wall will have exactly two paintings - one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would have only the work of two students, and this contradicts the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, choice B cannot be true.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Four art students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, Isaacs
  - Each student will display exactly two paintings - an oil and a watercolor
  - Two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room in an upper-lower position
  - Conditions:
    - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
    - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
    - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
    - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
    - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then there must be two paintings of a third student displayed on that wall, which violates the condition that "No wall has only watercolors displayed on it". Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then there must be two paintings of a third student displayed on that wall, which violates the condition that "No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it". Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: According to the condition "Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed", Greene's oil must be displayed in a lower position. Therefore, C cannot be true.
D: There is no condition that directly relates to Hidalgo's watercolor being displayed in a lower position. Therefore, D can be true.
E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then there must be two paintings of a third student displayed on that wall, which violates the condition that "No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it". Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Each student has one oil and one watercolor painting.
  - Each wall has one upper and one lower painting.
  - No wall has just watercolors.
  - No wall has only one student's paintings.
  - Franz and Isaacs cannot be on the same wall.
  - Greene's watercolor and Franz's oil are displayed on the same wall.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position on Wall 4.

A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then that wall has both of their paintings, violating the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. This could be true.
B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would have their paintings and would also have both of Isaacs's paintings. This would violate the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. This could be true.
C: This could be true; it does not violate any of the given conditions.
D: This could be true; it does not violate any of the given conditions.
E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would have their paintings and would also have both of Franz's paintings. This would violate the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. This could not be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are four walls - 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  - Each wall has one upper and one lower position.
  - Four students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs, with each displaying two paintings - one oil and one watercolor.
  - No wall has only watercolors or works of a single student.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
We can try to place the paintings according to the given conditions and see which of the options violates those conditions. Let's make a chart to display possible positions of the paintings.

For wall 1, possible pairs of paintings are FH and GI. 
For wall 2, possible pairs of paintings are FH and GI. 
For wall 3, possible pairs of paintings are FG and HI.
For wall 4, possible pairs of paintings are FH and GI.


| Wall | Upper | Lower |
|------|-------|-------|
|  1   |   F   |   H   |
|      |   G   |   I   |
|------|-------|-------|
|  2   |   F   |   H   |
|      |   G   |   I   |
|------|-------|-------|
|  3   |   F   |   H   |
|      |   H   |   I   |
|------|-------|-------|
|  4   |   G   |   I   |
|      |   F   |   I   |
|------|-------|-------|


D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
If Hidalgo's watercolor is in the lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be in the upper position on one of the walls 1, 2, or 3 and Isaacs's oil must be in the lower position of wall 4.
If Hidalgo's oil is in the upper position on wall 1, 2, or 3, then Franz's watercolor must be in the lower position of that wall, which implies that Franz's oil must be on another wall. But Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position on the wall where Franz's oil is displayed. Hence, this scenario is not possible.
Similarly, if Hidalgo's oil is in the lower position on wall 1, 2, or 3, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be in the upper position of another wall, which implies that Hidalgo's oil must be on another wall. But no wall can have only the work of one student displayed on it. Hence, this scenario is also not possible.
Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be in the lower position and Option D is the answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  - Each student displays exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Analysis:
  - Choice A is possible. If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Hidalgo's oil and Isaacs's watercolor must be on the same wall and that wall would have paintings from all four students and no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - Choice B is possible. If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Greene's oil and Isaacs's watercolor must be on the same wall and that wall would have paintings from all four students and no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - Choice C is possible. If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then it must be on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which is displayed in the lower position. This satisfies the condition that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Choice D is possible. If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then it must be on the same wall as Isaacs's oil, which is displayed in the lower position. This satisfies the condition that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Choice E is not possible. If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would have the works of only two students (Isaacs and Hidalgo) displayed on it, which violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Each student displays exactly 2 paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  - There are 4 walls.
  - Each wall has exactly 2 paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall can have only watercolors.
  - No wall can have only one student's works.
  - Wall 4 has Isaacs's oil in the lower position.
  - There is no wall that has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
  - If Greene's painting is on a wall, it will be on the same wall as Franz's oil painting.

A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's oil painting must be displayed on a different wall than Greene's watercolor, which means Greene must have another painting on his wall (either Hidalgo's oil or watercolor), which contradicts the condition that no wall can have only one student's works. This cannot be true.
B: Franz's and Hidalgo's paintings can be displayed on the same wall. This is possible.
C: This is possible since we know that Greene's painting can be displayed in an upper position if it is on the same wall as Franz's oil.
D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position since each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. This is possible.
E: If Isaacs' watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Isaacs' oil painting must be on a different wall than Isaacs' watercolor. This means that either Franz or Greene must have both an oil and watercolor painting on their wall, which violates the condition that no wall can have only watercolors. This cannot be true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Each of the four students has one oil painting and one watercolor painting on display.
- Each of the four walls has one upper and one lower position.
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Analysis:
- Choice A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then the other two paintings on that wall must both be watercolors, which is not allowed as per the given conditions. This cannot be true.
- Choice B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then the other two paintings on that wall must both be oils, which is not allowed as per the given conditions. This cannot be true.
- Choice C: This is possible. According to the given condition, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, it is possible that Greene's oil is displayed in the lower position.
- Choice D: This is possible. Hidalgo's watercolor can be displayed on any of the four walls, and it can be displayed in either the upper or lower position.
- Choice E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then the other two paintings on that wall must both be watercolors, which is not allowed as per the given conditions. This cannot be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are 4 walls and each wall has one painting in the upper position and one painting in the lower position.
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student is displaying exactly two paintings—one oil and one watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  From the given information, we can infer that:
  - Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor are displayed on the same wall.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, her watercolor cannot be in the lower position of wall 4.
  Let's consider each option:
  A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz will have only watercolors on that wall. This violates the condition “No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.” Hence, this cannot be true.
  B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then wall 1 must have only watercolors on it. This violates the condition “No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.” Hence, this cannot be true.
  C: This condition is possible because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  D: This condition is possible because the position of Hidalgo's watercolor is not given.
  E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then wall 3 must have only watercolors on it. This violates the condition “No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.” Hence, this cannot be true.

Therefore, the answer is A.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  3. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  5. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Assessment:
  Consider each answer choice:
  A: Franz's watercolor and Greene's oil must be in positions (1, lower) and (2, upper) on some two walls. Since no wall can have only watercolors, one of the two walls must also have two oil paintings, which must be the Hidalgo oil and either the Hidalgo watercolor or the Isaacs oil. Thus, Franz's watercolor cannot be on the same wall as Greene's oil. A is true.
  B: If Franz's watercolor is on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall would also have to have Isaacs's watercolor, which would mean that Isaacs's oil would have to be on wall 3. But then wall 4 would have only watercolors, which is forbidden. Therefore, it is impossible for Franz's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil to be on the same wall. B is true.
  C: This is consistent with condition 4 above. C could be true.
  D: This is consistent with condition 1 above. D could be true.
  E: Suppose that Isaacs's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil are on the same wall. Then the wall would also have to have Isaacs's oil, and wall 3 would have to have Hidalgo's watercolor and Franz's oil. But that forces wall 2 to have only watercolors, which is forbidden. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil cannot both be on the same wall. E is true.

Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert
  D: Kyle and Nina
  E: Olivia and Kyle
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. The only day George can give a report is Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday both Helen and Irving must give reports.
  4. If Nina doesn't give a report on Monday, then on Wednesday both Helen and Irving must give reports.
  5. Exactly two reports will be given each day.
  6. Six students will give individual oral reports.
  
We are looking for a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday. 

Analysis: 
  Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, we know that he will not be giving his report on Wednesday. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give their reports in the morning. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday both Helen and Irving must give reports. If Nina doesn't give a report on Monday, then on Wednesday both Helen and Irving must give reports. Therefore, the only possible day that a pair of students have to give reports on Wednesday is if Nina doesn't give a report on Monday, then on Wednesday both Helen and Irving must give reports. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Six students give individual reports, so they must be distributed such that there are two reports each day.
  2. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Solution:
  1. If George can give his report only on Tuesday, the other report that day must also be given in either the morning or the afternoon.
  2. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (i.e., Tuesday or Wednesday) Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  3. If either Helen or Irving gives a report on Monday, the other must give a report on Tuesday. Since we already know that George must give a report on Tuesday, if Irving gives a report on Monday, then Helen must give a report on Tuesday, and vice versa.
  4. We must determine which pairs must give reports on Wednesday.
  5. If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
  6. If Nina does not give a report on Monday or Tuesday, then we know that her report will be on Wednesday. In this case, neither Helen nor Irving needs to give a report on Wednesday.
  7. If Helen and Irving both give reports on Tuesday, then no one else can give a report on Tuesday.
  8. If Helen and Irving give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, then George's report must be on Wednesday.
  9. If only one of Helen and Irving gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, the other of the pair must give a report on Wednesday. 

  From the above solution, it can be seen that the only possible pair that must give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Irving. Therefore, 
  Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- The question asks for a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday.

Answer:
From the given conditions, we know that if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day (either Tuesday or Wednesday). 
If Irving gives a report on Tuesday (the only day George can't give a report), then that means that Nina must either give her report on Tuesday or Wednesday. If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen must give her report on Wednesday, which means that the pair H and N should give reports on Wednesday. If Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then Irving and Helen must give their reports on Wednesday, which means that the pair H and I should give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, the pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday is Helen and Nina. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. George will give a report on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after the day Nina gives a report) Helen and Irving will both give reports, unless Nina gives a report on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Six students will give presentations in consecutive order on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  A: There are no restrictions that indicate that George and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  B: There are no restrictions that indicate that Helen and Nina must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  C: There are no restrictions that indicate that Irving and Robert must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  D: Nina must give a report to have Irving and Helen both give reports on the next day (after Nina's report). They are not required to give reports on Wednesday.
  E: There are no restrictions that indicate that Olivia and Kyle must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. George can give a report only on Tuesday.
  2. Olivia and Robert can not give afternoon reports.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Let's consider the options:
  A: There is no information about George or Tuesday, so we cannot determine if George and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday.
  B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, and hence they can't give reports on Wednesday. In this case, Nina and Helen will give reports on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give reports on any day but Monday. In this case, Helen and Nina can give reports on Wednesday. So, Helen and Nina can give reports on Wednesday.
  C: There is no information about Robert or Irving giving reports on Wednesday.
  D: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, so they can't give reports on Wednesday. In this case, Kyle and Nina will give reports on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give reports on any day but Monday. So, Kyle and Nina need not give reports on Wednesday.
  E: There is no information about Olivia or Kyle giving reports on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly six out of eight students will give oral reports during three consecutive days.
  2. Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and the other in the afternoon.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

To find the correct answer, let's analyze each pair of students:
  A. George and Lenore: George must give a report on Tuesday, so it's impossible for him to give a report on Wednesday. Eliminate A.
  B. Helen and Nina: If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give a report on the next day. So, if Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, then they can only give them on Wednesday. Keep B.
  C. Irving and Robert: Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Eliminate C.
  D. Kyle and Nina: Same as B, if Nina gives a report, then Kyle and Olivia must both give a report on the next day. Thus, if Kyle and Nina give reports on the same day, then they can only give them on Wednesday. Keep D.
  E. Olivia and Kyle: Same reason as C, eliminate E.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We know that George must give a report on Tuesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then both Helen and Irving must give reports together on the next day, unless Nina gives a report on Wednesday.
  
Reasoning:
  If Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving will give reports together on the next day. 
  If Nina's report is given on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports together on Wednesday. 
  So, if Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give her report on Wednesday. This means that she has to give it either on Monday or Tuesday. 
  If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving will give their reports together on Tuesday. If Nina gives report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving will give their reports together on Wednesday. 
  So, if Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must give their reports together on Wednesday. This means that they cannot give reports on the same day as each other since they have to give reports on consecutive days. Therefore, they both can only give reports on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

  - Six students will give reports:
    - Two students will give reports on Monday;
    - Two different students will give reports on Tuesday;
    - Two different students will give reports on Wednesday.
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - The following condition is true:
    - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - We need to find a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday.
  - George is already taking one of the spots on Tuesday.
  - Let's try to create scenarios to identify the pairs:
    - If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he will be paired with either Kyle or Lenore on Wednesday. We cannot be certain about the other pair for Wednesday. Therefore, A, B, C, and E are all possible pairs for Wednesday.
    - If George does not give a report on Tuesday, then he will have to give a report on Monday or Wednesday. In this case, we cannot be certain about any pair for Wednesday. Therefore, A, B, C, D, and E are all possible pairs for Wednesday.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  We are asked which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday, so we are looking for a pair of students that must give a report on Wednesday based on the given rules.
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (Wednesday) Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  
Analysis:
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. This means George cannot give a report on Tuesday, so George and Nina must give reports on Wednesday. This does not fit the question criteria because George does not have to give a report on Wednesday and Nina is the only student giving a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. This means George must give his report on Monday, and the remaining three students (Lenore, Kyle, and Olivia) must give their reports on Tuesday. The only remaining pair of students (not yet paired with someone else) is Helen and Nina, and they both must give their reports on Wednesday, meeting the question requirements.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six of eight students will give individual oral reports.
  6. Report will be given during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
  A: We have no information about George and Lenore giving reports on the same day or Wednesday. So, this choice is not correct.
  B: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. So, Nina and Helen must give reports on Wednesday. But, we have no information about Helen and Nina giving reports on the same day. So, this choice is not correct.
  C: We have no information about Irving and Robert giving reports on Wednesday. So, this choice is not correct.
  D: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday Helen and Irving must give reports. So, Kyle and Nina must give reports on Wednesday. But, we have no information about Kyle and Nina giving reports on the same day. So, this choice is not correct.
  E: We have no information about Olivia and Kyle giving reports on Wednesday. So, this choice is not correct.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.

Process of Elimination:
  - Choice A: If the shoe store is in space 2 and the optometrist is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be either in space 6 or in space 1. But the pharmacy cannot be in space 6 because the shoe store would be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, violating one of the constraints. So, the pharmacy must be in space 1. However, this violates the constraint that one of the restaurants must be at one end of the row. Therefore, choice A is not possible.
  - Choice B: If the shoe store is in space 2 and the pharmacy is in space 1, then one of the restaurants must be in space 7. This satisfies the constraint that one of the restaurants must be at one end of the row. The optometrist and the veterinarian can be in spaces 3 and 4 in either order, since the pharmacy is next to either one. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the two restaurants must be in spaces 5 and 6 in either order. Therefore, choice B could be true.
  - Choice C: If the shoe store is in space 2 and a restaurant is in space 3, then the other restaurant must be in space 7, which violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, choice C is not possible.
  - Choice D: If the shoe store is in space 2 and the toy store is in space 6, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 and one of the restaurants must be in space 7. But this violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, choice D is not possible.
  - Choice E: If the shoe store is in space 2 and the veterinarian is in space 4, then the optometrist and the pharmacy must be in spaces 3 and 1 in either order, since the pharmacy is next to either one. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the two restaurants must be in spaces 5 and 6 in either order. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 7. Therefore, choice E could be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row and seven businesses to be located, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy and one restaurant have fixed locations at opposite ends of the row.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the shoe store is in space 2, then the optometrist cannot be in space 1.
  
Analysis:
  - The shoe store is in space 2, so the businesses in spaces 1 and 3 must be either the pharmacy or a restaurant and the other must be a restaurant. 
  - The optometrist cannot be in space 1 because it cannot be next to the pharmacy.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the optometrist cannot be in space 1, the pharmacy must be in space 1 and the veterinarian in space 3.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. So, the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 4 and 5 or in spaces 5 and 6. They can only be in spaces 4 and 7 or in spaces 3 and 6. 
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. So, the toy store can be in space 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
  Therefore, if the shoe store is in space 2, then the toy store could be in space 6 (D) as there is no constraint preventing it, and it cannot be in space 4 because that is next to the veterinarian.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 7 businesses that need to be located.
  2. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants must be at the other end.
  3. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  4. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Analysis:
  - If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses, so they cannot occupy spaces 2, 3, 4, or 6.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then it must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. In either case, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 5. Spaces 3 and 4 must be occupied by the two restaurants, which violates the constraint that they must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the optometrist, the veterinarian, and one of the restaurants cannot be in spaces 3, 4, or 6. This means that space 6 can only be occupied by the other restaurant. However, this violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end, so this scenario is not possible.
  - Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. It must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, so one of those two businesses must be in space 6. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 4 or space 5. Spaces 3 and 4 must be occupied by the two restaurants (in some order). Therefore, the only thing we know for sure is that the shoe store is in space 2, and the pharmacy is in space 7.

Action: Answer("D") - The toy store is in space 6.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  We have a shopping center with seven spaces numbered 1 through 7.
  Seven different businesses are going to occupy each of the seven spaces.
  The pharmacy must occupy either space 1 or space 7.
  A restaurant must occupy an end space, which means either space 1 or space 7.
  The two restaurants have to be separated by at least two businesses.
  The pharmacy must be located next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be located next to the veterinarian.
  The shoe store is in space 2.

Analysis: 
  The shoe store is occupying space 2, which means that the businesses located in spaces 1 and 3 must fulfill the constraints. 
  Therefore, the pharmacy must occupy space 1 or 7 and a restaurant must occupy space 3.  
  Since the two restaurants have to be separated by at least two businesses, the vet and optometrist cannot occupy spaces 3 and 4 consecutively or spaces 4 and 5.
  Therefore, the optometrist cannot occupy space 5. 
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then either the optometrist or the veterinarian must occupy space 2, but the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. So, the toy store cannot be in space 3 because the vet would be in space 2, so choice A is not correct.
  If the pharmacy is not in space 1, the pharmacy must be in space 7 and the optometrist or veterinarian will be in space 6. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store cannot be in space 5. Therefore, choice D is also not correct.
  The only remaining option is that the pharmacy must be in space 1, which makes choice B correct.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are seven spaces in total (1 through 7), arranged in a straight row.
- Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, one of the restaurants at the other.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
- The shoe store is in space 2.

Action: Answer("E")
Explanation: 
- If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 3.
- The optometrist cannot be in space 5 since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the pharmacy can only be in space 1 or space 3.
- Similarly, a restaurant cannot be in space 3 since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, one of the restaurants at the other. Therefore, one of the restaurants must be in space 3.
- Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the optometrist and the veterinarian must be in spaces 4 and 6, in some order.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 7.
- Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 4.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  The shoe store is in space 2.
  That leaves the optometrist, the pharmacy, the two restaurants, the toy store, and the veterinarian to be placed in spaces 1,3,4,5,6, and 7.
  
Analysis:
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, it must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. This means that one of the restaurants must be in space 7. But this means that the two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses, which is a constraint.
  If a restaurant is in space 3, then the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. But this means that the restaurant in space 7 must be the second restaurant, which contradicts the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  If the toy store is in space 6, then the veterinarian cannot be in space 4. This means that the veterinarian must be in space 7 and one of the restaurants must be in space 3. But this means that the other restaurant cannot be separated by at least two other businesses, which is a constraint.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: The only option that satisfies all constraints is option A. If the optometrist is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be next to it in space 6. The veterinarian cannot be in space 4, so it must be in space 7. This means that one of the restaurants must be in space 3 and the other restaurant must be in space 1, which satisfies the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Finally, the toy store cannot be in space 4 or 6 (due to the constraint that it cannot be next to the veterinarian), so it must be in space 1, 3, or 7. Therefore, option A is a possible scenario.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
- The shoe store is in space 2. 

Analysis:
- The pharmacy must be at either end, so it cannot be in space 2.
- From the rule that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, we know that the restaurant cannot be in space 3.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, which means it cannot be in space 7 since there's no other space adjacent to space 7.
- Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, which means it cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
- The optometrist can only be in space 3 or space 6.
- The veterinarian cannot be in space 4 because the toy store cannot be next to it.
- The only possible option is that a restaurant is in space 3 and the optometrist is in space 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  This is a logic problem with given constraints that need to be followed to determine the valid locations of each business.
  If the shoe store is in space 2, the optometrist can be in space 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis: 
  If the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 as the pharmacy needs to be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Additionally, if the toy store is in space 3, then the restaurant cannot be in space 4 (because it needs to be separated from the other restaurant by at least two other businesses), so the restaurant must be in space 7. This means that the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist, and since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it must be in space 1. This also means that the veterinarian cannot be in space 3, so the optometrist must be in space 5. Therefore, the only option that could be true is A: the optometrist is in space 5.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
If the shoe store is in space 2, then:
- the pharmacy must be in space 1 or in space 7.
- one of the restaurants must be in space 1 or 7.
- the toy store cannot be in space 1, space 3, or space 7.
- the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 3, space 4, or space 6.
- the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
A: If the optometrist is in space 5, then the other 4 businesses must be in spaces 1, 2, 3, and 7. There would only be one space left for the restaurants, and they cannot be next to each other. Therefore, this is not possible.
B: If the pharmacy is in space 1, then one of the restaurants must be in space 7. Therefore, the two restaurants cannot be separated by at least two other businesses. This is not possible.
C: If a restaurant is in space 3, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 and the other restaurant must be in space 7. Therefore, the two restaurants would not be separated by at least two other businesses. This is not possible.
D: If the toy store is in space 6, then the other 4 businesses must be in spaces 1, 2, 3, and 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7, and one of the restaurants must be in the other end. If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the other restaurant must be in space 5, which violates the constraint of the restaurants being separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1, and the other restaurant must be in space 7. This satisfies all constraints, so this could be true.
E: If the veterinarian is in space 4, then the optometrist must be in space 6 (since the pharmacy cannot be next to the veterinarian). Therefore, the other 4 businesses must be in spaces 1, 2, 3, and 7. There would only be one space left for the restaurants, and they cannot be next to each other. Therefore, this is not possible.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  5. The shoe store is in space 2.
  
Analysis:
- The pharmacy must be at space 1 or space 7.
- One of the restaurants must be either at space 1 or space 7. Therefore, the other restaurant must be at space 4.
- With the restaurant at space 4, the only possible places for the pharmacy to be are spaces 1 and 3.
- Therefore, the optometrist must be at space 3 or space 7, and the veterinarian must be at the opposite space, space 5 or space 1.
- Since the shoe store is at space 2, the toy store cannot be at space 1, space 3, or space 3.
- Therefore, the toy store could be at space 4, space 5, or space 6.
- Choice A is not possible because the optometrist cannot be at space 5 if the shoe store is at space 2, since the optometrist must be next to the pharmacy.
- Choice B is possible if the pharmacy is at space 1.
- Choice C is also possible if the restaurant is the one located at space 7.
- Choice D is possible because the toy store could be at space 6.
- Choice E is not possible because the veterinarian must be at either space 5 or space 1.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are 4 lectures, one for each topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each art historian gives exactly one lecture on a topic.
  The order of the lectures must follow these rules:
    - oil paintings and watercolors must both be before lithographs
    - Farley's lecture must be before oil paintings
    - Holden's lecture must be before Garcia's and Jiang's lectures

Approach:
  If watercolors is third, then we know that the order of the lectures must be one of the following two possibilities: 
  1. oil, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs
  2. sculptures, oil, watercolors, lithographs
  For each option, we can check which of the answer choices could be true given the rest of the constraints.

Solution:
  Option 1: oil, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs
    - Farley's lecture cannot be on watercolors or sculptures, so Farley must give either the oil or lithographs lecture.
    - Holden's lecture must be on sculptures, so D is false.
    - Garcia must give the sculpture lecture, so C is false.
    - Jiang must give the oil painting lecture, so E is false.
    - Answer A is true. Farley can give the watercolors lecture.

  Option 2: sculptures, oil, watercolors, lithographs
    - Farley's lecture must be on lithographs, so Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture. A is false.
    - Holden's lecture must be on sculptures, so D is true.
    - Garcia's lecture must be on oil paintings, so B is true.
    - Jiang's lecture must be on watercolors, so E is true.
    - Answer C is false.

  Therefore, the possible answer is Answer("A"). Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Four art historians are giving four lectures on different topics.
  2. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  3. The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  4. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  5. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  6. If the watercolors lecture is third, then sculptures lecture must be second.
  
Based on the above knowledge, we can deduce that the order of the lectures must be as follows:
1. Farley - Sculptures
2. Holden - Watercolors
3. Garcia - Oil paintings
4. Jiang - Lithographs

Therefore:
  A: Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture because Holden must give the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture because Holden must give the watercolors lecture and Farley must give a lecture earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia cannot give the sculptures lecture because Holden must be earlier than Garcia's lecture.
  D: Holden can give the sculptures lecture because Farley must give the sculptures lecture and Holden must be earlier than Garcia's lecture.
  E: Jiang cannot give the lithographs lecture because the lithographs lecture must be last.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are four lectures, each on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang will each give one lecture on one of the topics.
  The schedule of the lectures must satisfy the following constraints:
    1. The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    2. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    3. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
    
  If the watercolors lecture is third, that means lithographs are the last topic to be covered.
  We also know that Holden has to give the first lecture, because he must speak before Garcia and Jiang do.
  From these two pieces of information, we can infer that Farley will give the second lecture.
  This leaves Garcia and Jiang to give the third and fourth lectures, in some order.

Analysis:
  A: Farley is already assigned to the second lecture, so he cannot give the watercolors lecture, which is third.
  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, he cannot give the sculptures or lithographs lectures, based on the constraints.
  C: Garcia could give the sculptures lecture, since it is not ruled out by the constraints.
  D: Holden cannot give the sculptures lecture, because he already has to give the first lecture.
  E: Jiang is already assigned to the final lecture, so he cannot give the watercolors, oil paintings, or sculptures lectures.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are four lectures to be given: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives only one lecture, and each lecture is on a different topic.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time, so they must occur in some order.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

We are given that the watercolors lecture is third. This means that the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs.

A: Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture because it is third.
B: This is possible if the order is sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs.
C: This is not possible if the watercolors lecture is third because Garcia must give a lecture later than Holden's, and Holden's lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture.
D: This is possible if the order is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs.
E: This is not possible if the order is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs because the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians will give four public lectures on different topics.
  - Each historian will give a lecture on a different topic.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time.
  - Lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors are the topics of the lectures.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - The watercolors lecture is third.
  
Action: Answer("D") 

If watercolors are the third lecture, it means the order of the lectures is already fixed. It must be oil painting, lithographs, watercolors, and sculptures in that order. From the given constraints, we know that Farley must be the first speaker and Holden must speak before Garcia and Jiang. Therefore, the possible speakers for each topic are as follows:
  - Oil Paintings: Farley
  - Lithographs: Jiang
  - Watercolors: unknown (not enough info)
  - Sculptures: Holden or Garcia
Only D is a possible answer because it is the only one where Holden speaks at all.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The lectures are on four topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Constraints:
    * Oil painting and watercolor lectures are before the lithograph lecture
    * Farley's lecture is before the oil painting lecture
    * Holden's lecture is before Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  If the watercolor lecture is third, then the order of the lectures from first to last is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs.
  
Analysis:
  A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley's lecture would be second, contradicting the fact that oil paintings is second. A is not true.
  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Garcia's lecture would be first, this contradicts the fact that the oil paintings lecture is second. B is not true.
  C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the oil paintings lecture would be given by Holden, which is possible since Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture. C could be true.
  D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia's lecture would be last, this contradicts the fact that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture. D is not true.
  E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then Farley's lecture would be oil paintings as it is the only remaining option that is earlier in the schedule than the lithographs lecture. This is possible because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. E could be true.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The art historians are Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
  - The lectures are on lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian gives a lecture on a different topic.
  - The oil paintings and watercolors lectures are both earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - Given that the watercolors lecture is third, we know that neither Farley nor Holden gives the watercolors lecture.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, Farley's lecture can only be on sculptures or lithographs.
  - Since Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, Holden's lecture must be on either watercolors (first or second), sculptures (first or second), or oil paintings (third). But we know that Holden's lecture is also earlier than the watercolors lecture, so Holden's lecture must be on either sculptures or oil paintings.
  - Since the watercolors lecture is third, oil paintings and sculptures must be first and second in some order. Jiang and Garcia must be giving the oil paintings and sculptures lectures, but we don't know which is which.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  - Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture is a possible arrangement given the constraints.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are four lectures to be given: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  The watercolors lecture is third.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
  A: If Farley is giving the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be given first or second, and since the watercolors lecture is already third, this is not possible.
  B: If Garcia is giving the oil paintings lecture, then Holden's lecture must be given first or second and Farley must give the watercolors lecture. Jiang gives the lithographs lecture in this scenario.
  C: If Garcia is giving the sculptures lecture, then Holden must give the oil paintings lecture and Farley the watercolors lecture. This leaves Jiang with the lithographs lecture and contradicts the given rule that the oil paintings lecture must come before the lithographs lecture.
  D: If Holden is giving the sculptures lecture, then Farley must give the watercolors lecture and Garcia must give the oil paintings lecture. This leaves Jiang with the lithographs lecture and contradicts the given rule that the oil paintings lecture must come before the lithographs lecture.
  E: If Jiang is giving the lithographs lecture, then Farley must give the watercolors lecture and Holden must give the oil paintings lecture, leaving Garcia with the sculptures lecture and contradicting the given rule that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The schedule of the lectures is: oil paintings, watercolors, ?, lithographs
  - Farley's lecture is before the oil paintings lecture
  - Holden's lecture is before Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture
  - Watercolors lecture is third
  A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then he must give it before the oil paintings lecture, which is not possible since the watercolors lecture is already third.
  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be before the oil paintings lecture. That means Farley's lecture must either be the first or the second lecture, which is not possible if the watercolors lecture is already third.
  C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the oil paintings lectures and the watercolors lecture must be first and second, but we know that watercolor is third. Hence this option is not possible.
  D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia and Jiang's topic will be either oil paintings or lithographs, but the schedule of the lectures must be: oil paintings, watercolors, ?, lithographs. Therefore this option is also not possible.
  E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the schedule of the lectures must be: oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures, lithographs. This satisfies all the constraints.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures, each on a different topic, with each one to be given by a different art historian.
  2. The topics are: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  3. The lectures will be given one at a time.
  4. There are some constraints on the order of the lectures:
      - the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
      - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
      - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  5. The watercolors lecture is third.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  Since the watercolors lecture is third, lithographs must be last. From the given constraints, we know that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture; therefore, oil paintings lecture is second. Also, Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture; therefore, Farley's lecture is first. 
  We know that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, which means Holden's lecture must be second or first. However, we know that Farley's lecture is already first, so Holden's lecture must be second. 
  Therefore, Garcia must give the sculptures lecture, since Jiang must give the last lecture, which is the lithographs lecture. Thus, the only possible option is Holden giving the sculptures lecture, which is option D.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected as a botanist. Furthermore, since M cannot be selected, K must be selected as a chemist. 

A: If K is selected, then at most one botanist and one zoologist can be selected. So, both G and F cannot be selected. However, it is also possible that K is not selected, in which case this statement has no bearing on whether G can be selected.
B: L can be selected without violating any of the conditions.
C: K must be selected as the only chemist, but it is not necessary that exactly one chemist is selected.
D: This statement is false. F can be selected with any combination of chemists as long as only one botanist is selected.
E: This statement is false. G can be selected with any combination of chemists as long as only one botanist is selected.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The panel consists of 5 members selected from botanists (F, G, H), chemists (K, L, M), and zoologists (P, Q, R)
  - At least one scientist of each type must be selected.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Action: Answer("B")

If P is the only zoologist selected, then we must have one botanist and one chemist to satisfy the condition of having at least one scientist of each type. Therefore, we have two more spots to fill on the panel.

If F is selected, there can be at most one zoologist. Since P is the only zoologist selected, F cannot be selected. Therefore, if F is not selected, L must be selected to form a full panel. 

If L is selected, K cannot be selected due to the condition that F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, B must be true, if P is the only zoologist selected.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
To Solve the problem:
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then R must also be selected. 
  - Since at least one botanist is to be included, either F, G, or H must be selected. 
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, either F or G can be selected, but not both. 
  - K cannot be selected because if K is selected then neither F nor G can be selected.
  - L cannot be selected because if L is selected and F is selected, then K and M both have to be selected - which violates the given constraints. 
  - Therefore, H and either F or G will be selected along with P and R.
  
Analysis of Options:
A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. -> We have already determined that either F or G will be included in the panel. Therefore, this option is not true. 

B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. -> This option is not true because F can be selected along with H. 

C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. -> This option is not true because at least one chemist must be included but K cannot be selected because F or G has to be included. 

D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. -> This option is true because if F is selected, then both K and M have to be selected which violates the given constraints. Therefore, F cannot be selected if exactly two chemists are selected. 

E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. -> This option is not true because if G is included, F and H can also be included. 

Action: Answer("D") -> If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - We need at least one scientist in each group (Botanist, Chemist and Zoologist)
  - If we have more than one botanist, we can have at most one zoologist
  - F and K cannot both be selected
  - K and M cannot both be selected
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R are not selected.
  
Using the above knowledge we can check the answer choices:
A. If K is selected, F cannot be selected, so this statement might or might not be true.
B. If L is selected, there must be one Chemist in the panel, which can be either K or M. None of the conditions prohibit F from being selected with L, so this statement is false.
C. If exactly one Chemist is selected, it can be either K or M. This statement might or might not be true.
D. If exactly two Chemists are selected, F and G cannot both be selected because we already need a Botanist. This statement is true.
E. If exactly two Chemists are selected, F and K cannot both be selected because F and K cannot be selected together.  This statement might or might not be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel has 5 scientists in total.
  - There are 3 botanists (F, G, H), 3 chemists (K, L, M), and 3 zoologists (P, Q, R) to choose from.
  - There must be at least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, zoologist).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, at most one zoologist can be selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - We know that only P is selected as the zoologist.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If only P is the zoologist selected, then we must have one botanist and one chemist as well. It can't be F since F and K cannot both be selected (and we have to select K). Therefore, either G or H must be the botanist. If L is selected (which is possible), it excludes F since F and L cannot be together (we only have one chemist spot). 
  A: If K is selected, then we must have G and P (since only 1 zoologist can be selected when there are 2 botanists). But there is no conflict with selecting G if K is selected, so this choice is not necessarily true.
  B: If L is selected, then we cannot select F (we only have one chemist spot). Therefore, this choice must be true.
  C: Since we know we need a chemist, a botanist, and a zoologist, it is not necessarily true that K must be chosen, so this choice is not correct.
  D: It is possible to have F if exactly two chemists are selected since we only have one botanist spot. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true.
  E: It is possible to have G if exactly two chemists are selected since we only have one botanist spot. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  -  At least one scientist of each type is required.
  -  If more than one botanist is selected, at most one zoologist can be selected.
  -  If M is selected, P and R must also be selected.
  -  F and K cannot both be selected.
  -  K and M cannot both be selected.
  -  If P is the only zoologist selected, then there will be at most one botanist on the panel.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
If P is the only zoologist selected, then at most one botanist is on the panel. Given that F, G, and H are the only botanists, if P is selected, then the botanist on the panel is either F, G, or H. We can now go through each option:

A: There is no relationship between K and G, so this statement cannot be inferred from the given conditions. Eliminated.
B: L can be selected regardless of whether F is selected or not. Eliminated. 
C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be either K, L, or M. This option cannot be true based on the given conditions. Eliminated.
D: If exactly two chemists are selected and one of them is K, then M cannot be selected. If M is not selected, then F can be selected. Therefore, if exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. This statement must be true as it is the only option left.
E: There is no relationship between G and the number of chemists selected, so this statement cannot be inferred from the given conditions. Eliminated.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
- The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
- If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must also be selected from the zoologists.
- There can be at most one zoologist if there are more than one botanist.

Analysis:
- If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must also be selected from the zoologists, otherwise there will be no panelist from the other two categories.
- If M is not selected, then neither P nor R can be selected.
- If K is selected, then neither F nor M can be selected.
- If F is selected, then neither K nor M can be selected.
- If L is selected, then G can or cannot be selected depending on the selection of the other panelists.

Action: 
  Option A: If K is selected, then G cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true, because K, G, and P can be selected in the panel.
  Option B: If L is selected, then F cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true, because L, F, and P can be selected in the panel.
  Option C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This is not necessarily true, because the panel can have either K, L, or M as the only selected chemist.
  Option D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. This is true. Since K and M cannot be selected together, at least one of them cannot be selected. If only one chemist is selected instead of two, then one of K, L, or M can still be selected along with either a botanist or a zoologist. So, the correct choice is D.
  Option E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true, because G can be selected with K and P being the other panelists.

Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F or G must be selected from the botanists, and either K, L, or M must be selected from the chemists.
  
  A: We do not have enough information to determine this.
  B: We do not have enough information to determine this.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be either K or L. We cannot say for sure which one it would be, so this statement is not true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then either K and L, K and M, or L and M must be selected. If K and M cannot both be selected, then it must be the case that L and M are selected. In this case, only F or G can be selected from the botanists. Therefore, F cannot be selected if exactly two chemists are selected. This statement is true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then either K and L, K and M, or L and M must be selected. If K and L are selected, then either F or G must be selected from the botanists. If K and M are selected, then P and R must also be selected (due to the rule that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected). This means that G would be the only remaining botanist, so G can be selected. If L and M are selected, then only F or G can be selected from the botanists. Therefore, it is possible for exactly two chemists to be selected and G to also be selected. This statement is not true.

  - The panel must include at least one scientist from each of the botanist, chemist, and zoologist groups.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. 
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either G or H must be selected as a botanist, and either K or L must be selected as a chemist. M cannot be selected because it would require P to select both R and M, but the panel can only have five people. 

  A: If K is selected, then H must also be selected as a botanist. This choice is not related to P being the only zoologist selected, so it must be false.
  B: If L is selected as a chemist, then G or H must be selected as a botanist. This choice is not related to P being the only zoologist selected, so it must be false.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, then either G or H must be selected as a botanist. This is not necessarily K, so this choice is false.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then one of them must be L and the other must be either K or M. If K is selected, then G or H must be selected as a botanist. This would leave no room for a zoologist since P is the only available one. Therefore, if exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. This choice is true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then one of them must be K and the other is either L or M. If K is selected, then G or H must be selected as a botanist. This is not related to P being the only zoologist selected, so this choice is false.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R are not selected.
  
Analysis:
  - Since P is the only zoologist and both F and G are botanists, then neither F nor G can be selected if Q and R are not selected.
  - If K is selected, then F cannot be selected since F and K cannot both be selected.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a sales representative who cannot work in the same zone as Quinn, given the conditions.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. This means, the other one works in zone 2 or 3.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  Let's start with the options for who cannot work in the same zone as Quinn:
  A: Kim - no known conditions yet.
  B: Mahr - no known conditions yet.
  C: Stuckey - Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone as each other, so if Quinn works in Zone 3, Stuckey cannot be in the same zone as Quinn. If Quinn works in Zone 1, there are no conflicts with Stuckey.
  D: Tiao - If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra is in Zone 2 or 3. If Quinn is with Parra in that zone, then Tiao cannot be in the same zone as Quinn. If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is in Zone 3 and Stuckey cannot be in the same zone as Quinn. If Tiao is in Zone 3, there are no conflicts with Quinn.
  E: Udall - If Udall is in Zone 2, then Tiao is in Zone 3 and there are no conflicts with Quinn. If Udall is in Zone 3, then Stuckey cannot be in the same zone with Quinn.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Stuckey
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The sales representatives are Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall, and the sales zones are Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as either Parra or Kim.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Kim, then Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3. But this would mean that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, then either Tiao or Udall (but not both) must work in Zone 2. This would mean that at least four sales representatives work in Zone 3. However, if Stuckey and Udall are in Zone 3, then Parra must be in Zone 1 with Tiao. This would mean that Quinn is in Zone 2 with Mahr and Kim. If this is the case, then there would not be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  This leaves only one possible person that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone with, which is Stuckey. If Quinn is in the same sales zone as Parra (which is not Zone 1) and if Udall and Tiao are in Zone 2, then Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey must be in Zone 3, and Quinn cannot be in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  We need to identify the other sales representative that if works in the same zone as Quinn will violate the conditions given.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 1, and it will not be possible to satisfy the condition "Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1", so it's not possible for Quinn to work in Zone 1.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra works in Zone 1 and cannot satisfy the "Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1" condition, so Tiao cannot work in Zone 2. In this case, Udall works in Zone 3 and Stuckey works in the same zone which is not feasible because Udall and Stuckey work in the same zone. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Mahr, Kim, and one of Tiao or Udall are the remaining sales representatives for Zone 1 and Zone 2 combined. But either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1, so in this case, Udall works in Zone 2, and Tiao works in Zone 1 and Parra works in Zone 3. Stuckey cannot work in Zone 1, and Kim and Mahr cannot both work in Zone 2. So, in this case, it is possible for Quinn to work in Zone 3 with any of the other sales representatives. 
  The only remaining option is choice C: Stuckey. Therefore, the answer is 'Action: Answer("C")'.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  More of the sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  Quinn can work in the same sales zone as Kim, Mahr or Tiao since none of them have any restrictions with Quinn. 
  Similarly, Quinn can work in the same sales zone as Udall since Udall can either be in Zone 2 (with Tiao) or in Zone 3 (with Stuckey). 
  Therefore, Stuckey is the only sales representative that Quinn CANNOT work with since they work in the same sales zone and they must be in Zone 2 or Zone 3 together.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  According to the conditions:
  - Only Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  - Only Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  - There are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

If Quinn works in the same zone as Tiao, then Tiao and Udall would both have to work in Zone 2, which violates the condition that only one of them can work in that zone. If Quinn works in the same zone as Parra, then Mahr, Kim, Stuckey and Udall will have to work in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other and that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If Quinn worked in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then there would be only one sales representative for Zone 3, which contradicts the statement that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Parra or Tiao (but not both) work in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall (but not both) work in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, thus not both in Zone 1 or 2.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, thus not both in Zone 1 or 2.
  There are more representatives working in Zone 3 than Zone 2.

Working through the options:
  If Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim or Mahr, then there are only 5 representatives left for 3 zones, which would force there to be two zones with two representatives each, which is not allowed given the constraints.
  If Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey or Udall, then that means Parra and Tiao are both in Zone 1 and Zone 2, in some order, giving only one option for Zone 3 which does not satisfy the condition that more representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To satisfy all the given conditions:
  Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. (Let's say Parra works in Zone 1.)
  Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. (Let's say Tiao works in Zone 2.)
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone. (Quinn works in Zone 1.)
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. (Stuckey works in Zone 2.)
  Kim and Mahr work in Zone 3.

Now, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey (they are in different zones). So the answer is C: Stuckey.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra because they are already working in the same sales zone. 
  If Parra is in Zone 1, Tiao must be in Zone 2, and Udall cannot be in Zone 2 based on the rule "Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2." Therefore, Udall must be in Zone 3. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, Stuckey must be in Zone 3 as well. Therefore, more than one person works in Zone 3 and only one person works in Zone 2.
  Thus, we can conclude that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra. 
  A: Kim's work zone is unknown and cannot be determined.
  B: Mahr's work zone is unknown and cannot be determined.
  C: Stuckey's work zone is Zone 3.
  D: Tiao's work zone is either Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  E: Udall's work zone is Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  According to the given conditions:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
To determine the answer, we can eliminate the options that Quinn can work with since the question asks for the sales representatives that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone.
  
Eliminating options:
  - Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3. So, Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey will work in Zone 3. Thus, Quinn can work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, Answer("C").

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
Choices:
  A: Julio, Nessa
  B: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  E: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Kevin's and Rebecca's sessions are held on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - Wednesday has one morning session and one afternoon session.
  - Thursday has one morning session and one afternoon session.
  - Friday has one morning session and one afternoon session.

To determine who could lead the Thursday afternoon session, we need to use process of elimination:
- Julio cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
- Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because they lead sessions on the same day, and we know that Thursday has one morning and one afternoon session.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because they cannot lead sessions on the same day, and Thursday has one morning and one afternoon session.

Therefore, only Nessa is available to lead the Thursday afternoon session. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session can only be on either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning, and Nessa's session will be on Thursday afternoon or Friday afternoon.

On Thursday afternoon, the lab assistants that are available are those who are not leading a session at the same time and who can lead an afternoon session. From the given options:
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so neither of them can lead the Thursday afternoon session.
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so if Kevin leads a session on Thursday morning, then Rebecca must lead the Thursday afternoon session. However, if Kevin leads a session on Wednesday afternoon, then he cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session, and Rebecca cannot lead it alone. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca can only lead the Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning sessions in some order.
- Lan cannot lead sessions on Wednesday or Thursday, so she can only lead a Friday session. Therefore, she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session and can only lead on Thursday or Friday afternoon.

Thus, the only assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Nessa.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday. This means that Rebecca's session must also be on Thursday. Nessa's session must be in the afternoon, which means Nessa cannot lead the Thursday morning session.
  Thus, the lab assistants eligible for the Thursday afternoon session are Julio, Kevin, Lan, and Rebecca.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants.
  The lab sessions are scheduled over three days, one session each morning and one each afternoon.

To solve the problem, we have to determine which lab assistants could lead the Thursday afternoon session given that Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's. 

We know that Nessa has to lead an afternoon session. If Kevin's session is the day before Nessa's, it means that Kevin's session has to be on Wednesday afternoon, and Nessa's session has to be on Thursday afternoon. 

The lab assistant who leads the Thursday afternoon session cannot be Lan or Olivia because they cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Also, the lab assistant who leads the Thursday afternoon session cannot be Julio because Julio's session has to be on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. 

Option A (Julio, Nessa) is incorrect because Julio's session must be on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, and Olivia's session has to be Friday afternoon. So, Julio cannot lead a session on Thursday afternoon. 

Option B (Kevin, Rebecca) is incorrect because Kevin and Rebecca have to lead sessions that meet on the same day. However, we know that Kevin's session is on Wednesday afternoon, which means that Rebecca's session has to be on Wednesday morning, and she cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session. 

Option C (Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca) is correct because we already know that Nessa has to lead an afternoon session, and Kevin and Rebecca have to lead sessions that meet on the same day. Since Kevin's session is on Wednesday afternoon and Nessa's session is on Thursday afternoon, it means that Rebecca's session has to be on Thursday morning, which would allow any of these three lab assistants to lead the Thursday afternoon session. 

Option D (Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca) is incorrect because Julio's session must be on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, and Olivia's session has to be Friday afternoon. So, Julio cannot lead a session on Thursday afternoon. 

Option E (Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca) is incorrect because Lan cannot lead a session that meets on the same day as Olivia's session, which has to be Friday afternoon. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - We are looking for a list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  
Analysis:
  - If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  - Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session (since Kevin's session is on the same day and Rebecca's session should be on Friday).
  - Lan, Olivia, and Julio cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session (since they are not on the afternoon schedule for Thursday).
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session and it cannot be on Wednesday afternoon (since Julio's session should be on an earlier day than Olivia's).
  - Therefore, the lab assistant who could lead the Thursday afternoon session is Nessa or Rebecca.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - Each lab assistant must lead exactly one session on either:

        Wednesday morning
        Wednesday afternoon
        Thursday morning
        Thursday afternoon
        Friday morning
        Friday afternoon

  So, if Kevin’s session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Thursday must be a morning session, not an afternoon session, because Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and Kevin must lead that day either in the morning or in the afternoon.
  
  Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning because his session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  The possible cases for Kevin's and Rebecca's sessions are:

  - Kevin and Rebecca’s sessions are on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday afternoon (Case 1).
  - Kevin and Rebecca’s sessions are on Thursday afternoon and Friday afternoon (Case 2).

  By Case 1, Nessa’s session must be on Friday afternoon, which means Lan and Olivia's sessions must be on Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning. However, Julio’s session must be on Wednesday morning, which means that Julio cannot lead a session on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning. Therefore, Case 1 is not possible.

  By Case 2, Nessa’s session must be on Wednesday afternoon, which means Kevin and Rebecca’s sessions must be on Thursday afternoon and Friday afternoon, in some order. Olivia and Lan cannot lead a session on Thursday because they cannot share the same day, and they cannot lead a session on Friday afternoon either because Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Therefore, Olivia and Lan must lead the Wednesday morning session, and Julio must lead the Thursday morning session.

  To sum up, if Kevin’s session meets on the day before Nessa’s, then the only possible candidates for leading the Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Rebecca.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - Two sessions are held in the morning and two sessions in the afternoon, on each day.
  
Approach:
  - Kevin's session is on the day before Nessa's session.
  - We know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so let's consider the afternoon session of Thursday.
  - We need to consider the list of lab assistants that could lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  - We know that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. So, if Nessa is leading an afternoon session then Lan and Olivia must lead morning sessions on Thursday.
  - We know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. So, if Kevin's session is on Wednesday, then Rebecca's session must be on Wednesday too, and hence both Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.

Solution:
  - Since Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, Kevin's session must be on Wednesday and Nessa's session must be on Thursday.
  - Lan and Olivia must lead the Thursday morning sessions.
  - So, Julio and Rebecca must lead the Thursday afternoon sessions.
  - Therefore, a complete and accurate list of lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session is Julio, Rebecca.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

If Kevin's session is on Wednesday, then Nessa's session would be on Thursday, which means Julio's session would be on Wednesday as well. However, if Kevin's session is on Friday, then Nessa's session must be on Friday, and Julio's session must be on either Wednesday or Thursday. 
Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and Kevin's session is on the day before Nessa's, then Rebecca's session must be on Friday as well. Also, the sessions led by Lan and Olivia cannot be on the same day. Therefore, Lan's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday, and Olivia's session must be on either Thursday or Friday.
There are two possibilities for Friday's sessions: (1) Lan could lead the morning session, and Olivia could lead the afternoon session, or (2) Olivia could lead the morning session, and Lan could lead the afternoon session.
Thus, we have:
- Wednesday morning: Julio
- Wednesday afternoon: Lan or Olivia
- Thursday morning: one of {Julio, Lan, Olivia}
- Thursday afternoon: one of {Julio, Kevin, Rebecca}.
- Friday morning: one of {Julio, Lan, Olivia}
- Friday afternoon: one of {Lan-Olivia, Olivia-Lan, Kevin-Rebecca}.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  6. The lab sessions are scheduled over three days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. One session is held each morning and one each afternoon.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's session, then we can deduce the following constraints:
  1. Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon, because it's the only afternoon session left and it can't be on the same day as Rebecca's session.
  2. Kevin's session must be on Thursday, and Rebecca's session on Friday (they must lead sessions on the same day).
  3. Since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Julio's session cannot be on Friday morning, which means it must be on Wednesday morning. Therefore, Olivia's session is on Friday morning.
  4. Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session, since Olivia has the Friday morning session and they cannot lead sessions on the same day. Therefore, the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  5. Each lab assistant leads only one session.

Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and we know that Nessa's session is an afternoon session, Kevin and Rebecca must both be leading afternoon sessions. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca are leading Friday afternoon sessions. From the last constraint, Julio must be leading a session on either Wednesday or Thursday, and Olivia must be leading a session on either Thursday or Friday. If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then we know that Kevin and Rebecca are leading Friday afternoon sessions, and Nessa must be leading Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, the lab assistants available for Thursday afternoon session must satisfy the following constraints:
  1. Julio must be leading a session on Wednesday or Thursday.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session that meets on Thursday.
Hence, Julio, Kevin, and Rebecca are not available for the Thursday afternoon session. The lab assistants who are available are: Lan and Nessa.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which one of the following is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge: There are six slots in which six bands must perform. Vegemite is before Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon are before Xpert. Uneasy is in the last three slots. Yardsign is in the first three slots. If Zircon is before Yardsign, then Wellspring must be in a slot before that of Yardsign.
A and B are not possible answers since Wellspring cannot perform in slots 1 and 2 if Yardsign, which performs in one of the first three slots, must perform after Zircon, before whom Wellspring must perform.
C is a possible answer. If Wellspring performs in slot four, then Yardsign can perform in slot five and Zircon can perform in slot six.
D and E are not possible answers since Uneasy is in the last three slots and must perform after Wellspring and Xpert.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. The slots are numbered from one to six. 
  2. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  3. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  4. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  5. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
 
If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then the order of the three bands that must perform in the first three slots are: Zircon, Yardsign and either Wellspring or Vegemite. 

Wellspring can only perform before Xpert. Therefore, if Wellspring performs in the second slot, that leaves only one slot before Xpert performs, which it is not enough for both Zircon and Yardsign. Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring can perform is the third slot.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- There are six slots numbered one through six at a benefit concert. 
- Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will each perform only once in the slots.
- Vegemite has to perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
- Wellspring and Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Uneasy is to perform in one of the last three slots.
- Yardsign is to perform in one of the first three slots.

There are three cases to consider:
- Case 1: Zircon performs in slot 6 and Yardsign performs in slot 3. 
- Case 2: Zircon performs in slot 6 and Yardsign performs in slot 2.
- Case 3: Zircon performs in slot 5 and Yardsign performs in slot 1.

Considering the above cases, Wellspring can perform earliest in:
- Case 1: slot 4 (Wellspring has to perform earlier than Xpert, and Uneasy has to perform after Wellspring in slots 5 or 6)
- Case 2: slot 3 (Wellspring has to perform earlier than Xpert, and Uneasy has to perform after Wellspring in slots 4, 5, or 6)
- Case 3: slot 2 (Wellspring has to perform earlier than Xpert, and Uneasy has to perform after Wellspring in slots 3, 4, 5, or 6)

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon
  - Six slots numbered one through six. 
  - Vegemite performs before Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform before Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs earlier than Yardsign, then Zircon must be in slots one or two and Yardsign in slots three. 

Vegemite -> _ _ _ _ _  (Slot 3 must be reserved for Yardsign)
Wellspring and Zircon -> V _ W _ _ 
Uneasy must be in one of the last three slots, let's say slot 6 -> V _ W _ _ U
Xpert must be in slot 5 -> V _ W _ X U
If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon must be in slot 1, and Yardsign in slot 3 -> Z V W _ X U

Wellspring could perform in slot 2 or slot 4. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands have to fill six slots numbered from one to six.
  - Vegemite should perform earlier than Zircon, which means Zircon should take either slot five or slot six.
  - Wellspring and Zircon both should perform earlier than Xpert.
  - Uneasy should perform in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign should perform in one of the first three slots.
  
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign:
   - Zircon should take slot five or slot six
   - Yardsign should perform in either slot one, slot two, or slot three. 
   
  To determine the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform, we need to refer to the two constraints:
  - Wellspring should perform earlier than Xpert.
  - Zircon and Wellspring should perform earlier than Xpert.
   
  Since Xpert can only take slot five or slot six, Wellspring can perform in slot two or slot three. 
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands to be scheduled in six slots, 1 to 6.
  - Constraints: 
    1. Vegemite < Zircon
    2. Wellspring, Zircon < Xpert
    3. Uneasy is in {4,5,6}
    4. Yardsign is in {1,2,3}
  - Zircon < Yardsign, which means Yardsign cannot take the first slot (else contradicts #1) but can take the second or third slot.
  
Method: 
  - If Yardsign is in slot 2 or 3, then Wellspring cannot be in slot 1 (contradicts #4 because Wellspring is not in the first two slots and Yardsign is in slot 2 or 3).
  - So, Yardsign must be in slot 1 only. If so, the slots can be filled in the order {Yardsign, Vegemite, Uneasy, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert}.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign (given in question).
  
Constraint 5 means that Zircon must perform in slot one or two since Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots. Constraint 2 means that Xpert must perform in slot six. Now, there are only two possible options for slots one and two: either Zircon performs in slot one and Vegemite performs in slot two, or Vegemite performs in slot one and Zircon performs in slot two. In either case, Wellspring can perform in slot three because it is an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  We have six slots numbered one through six.
  Six bands - Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon - have to fill these slots.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  We need to find the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.

Reasoning: 
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then there are two possibilities:
  1. Zircon performs in slot 1 and Yardsign performs in slot 2. In this case, Wellspring can perform in slot 3, 4, or 5.
  2. Zircon performs in slot 2 and Yardsign performs in slot 3. In this case, Wellspring can perform in slot 4, 5, or 6.

Action: Answer("C") - slot four is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) are performing in six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs before Zircon.
  - Wellspring, Zircon, and Xpert performs in that order.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, this means Zircon can perform either in slot 1 or slot 2, and Yardsign can perform either in slot 3 or slot 4.

Analysis:
  - If Zircon performs in one of the first two slots, Wellspring can perform in slot 1. Otherwise, Wellspring cannot perform in slot 1.
  - If Zircon performs in slot 1, the order of the bands could be Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Uneasy or any other valid order.

Action: Answer("A")  
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  We need to create a valid order for the six bands to perform in the given six slots, where:
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  We need to determine the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  We also know that each band can perform in only one slot, and there are no other constraints.
  
  Let's create the order of the bands based on the given constraints:
  1. Yardsign
  2. Vegemite
  3. Zircon
  4. Wellspring
  5. Xpert
  6. Uneasy
  
  Now, if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, that means Yardsign must perform in slot 2 or 3. Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  There are a total of seven accomplices.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices must be Peters, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Stanton
  Since Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao and Tao is recruited last. That means Stanton cannot have been recruited fifth. So, the answer is D: fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The order of accomplices recruited by the main suspect is: Peters, [unknown], [unknown], [Peters], [unknown], Villas, White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruited accomplices must be Peters, [unknown], Quinn, Rovero, [unknown], Villas, White.
  If Stanton was recruited immediately before or after Tao, then the order of recruited accomplices could be either Peters, [unknown], Tao, Stanton, [unknown], Villas, White or Peters, [unknown], Stanton, Tao, [unknown], Villas, White.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then there must be only one possible order for these two recruits in the sequence.
  If Stanton was recruited, then there are only two possible positions for Stanton in the sequence.
  Tao and White can be recruited after Stanton in the sequence.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the possible orderings of the seven accomplices are:
  1. Peters, ? , ? , Quinn, Rovero, ? , ?
  2. ?, Peters, ? , Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?
  3. ?, ?, Peters, Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?
  4. ?, ?, ?, Peters, Quinn, Rovero, ?
  
  In order for Stanton NOT to have been recruited, he must have been recruited either first, second, fifth, or seventh.

Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Peters must have been recruited before Quinn and Rovero. Since Peters was recruited fourth, there are three people who were recruited before Peters. We don't know which three, but we know with certainty that Quinn and Rovero were recruited after Peters. Therefore, Stanton cannot have been recruited first or second, because if he had been, then he would have been recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.

Solution:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the only choices left for Stanton are third, fifth, and seventh. Therefore, Stanton COULD have been recruited fifth. The answer is NOT (A), (B), (C), or (E). Thus, the answer is (D). 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then there are only two possible orderings between Quinn, Rovero, and Villas: Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White (VRVW) or Villas, Quinn, Rovero, White (VQRW).
  In VRVW, Stanton must be recruited either third or fifth. In VQRW, Stanton must be recruited either second or seventh.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth and Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited in either position 1,2, or 3 and Rovero in either position 2,3, or 4.
  We know that Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor after Tao.
  We also know that Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
Analysis:
  If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero would have to be recruited in position 2 or 3, which means Stanton could be recruited in any of the remaining positions.
  If Quinn was recruited second, then Rovero would have to be recruited in position 3 or 4, which means Stanton could be recruited in any position except first or last.
  If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero would have to be recruited in position 4 or 5, which means Stanton could be recruited in any position except first or second.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then Villas would have to be in position 4 and White in position 5. This means Rovero would have to be in position 6, making Tao position 7. Therefore, Quinn cannot be recruited second. 
  If Quinn was recruited first, then Peters would have to be recruited second and there would not be a spot for Quinn to be "earlier than Rovero". 
  
Conclusion:
  Quinn cannot be recruited earlier than Rovero. 
Action: Answer("True")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order for the two of them is QR, in that order.
  Since Peters was recruited fourth, the order is PQ?R??? where ? represents unknown recruits.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White. Thus, the two of them appear in order as PQ?RVW.
  Since Stanton was not immediately before or after Tao, and Tao is not one of the four known recruits, we can infer that Stanton does not appear in the pattern ?Q?RT?? or ?T?RQ??.
  
Reasoning: 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, the order of the first six recruits is PQ, QR, RV, VW, ?. The detective knows that the suspect recruited one accomplice at a time, so the order of the seven recruits is PQ, QR, RV, VW, X, Y, and Z (in that order). If Stanton was the fifth recruit, the pattern would be ?Q?RT?Z. If Stanton was the seventh recruit, then the pattern would be ?T?RQ??. In either case, one of the conditions would be violated.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited 7 different accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. 
  Villas was recruited immediately before White. 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, Quinn must have been recruited either second or third.
  If Stanton was recruited immediately before or after Tao (but not both), then Stanton must have been recruited either first, second, fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  Therefore, the possibility remains that Stanton could have been recruited third or seventh, even if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Peters was recruited fourth, and the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.

Solution:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the first three people recruited would be Peters, Quinn, and Rovero. Stanton cannot have been recruited second because it would mean Stanton was recruited immediately after Tao, which is not possible. Also, if Stanton was recruited third, then Tao would have to be first or second, which is also not possible because Stanton was neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton must have been recruited fifth, after Villas and White.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  There are a total of 7 accomplices.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, the possible order of accomplices would be:
  Peters (4), Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White
  
  Stanton could have been recruited in the third, fifth, or sixth position.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We have a six-member band with each member performing exactly one solo.
  Guitarist's solo is not fourth.
  Percussionist performs before Keyboard player.
  Keyboard player performs after violinist and before guitarist.
  Saxophonist performs after either percussionist or trumpeter, but not both.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform solo fifth or sixth.
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, but we don't know his/her position.
  This leaves the violinist. According to the rules, the keyboard player must perform his/her solo after the violinist does.
  Therefore, the violinist must perform his/her solo before the saxophonist does. Thus, (C) is the correct answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Analysis:
  - If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the following must be true:
    - The percussionist must perform a solo before the saxophonist does.
    - Therefore, the saxophonist can only perform either 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th solo.
    - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the saxophonist cannot perform the fourth solo.
    - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist cannot perform after the percussionist. Therefore, the saxophonist performs after the trumpeter.
    - The violinist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does and after the percussionist, so we cannot determine if the violinist performs before or after the saxophonist.

Answer: Answer("D") - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There is a six-member band and each member performs exactly one solo.
  Restrictions:
  1. Guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  2. Percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  3. Keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist does.
  4. Saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then these are the possible orders of performance:
  1. Percussionist, Trumpeter, Saxophonist, Violinist, Keyboard Player, Guitarist
  2. Percussionist, Trumpeter, Violinist, Saxophonist, Keyboard Player, Guitarist
  3. Percussionist, Saxophonist, Trumpeter, Violinist, Keyboard Player, Guitarist
  4. Percussionist, Violinist, Trumpeter, Saxophonist, Keyboard Player, Guitarist
  
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo. - False, as there are three orders before the percussionist can perform.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo. - True, as this is the position of the percussionist solo in the possible orders.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does. - True, as this is a restriction and is applicable to all possible orders.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. - False, as this restriction is not applicable because the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. - False, as this is not applicable to all orders.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - A six-member band gives a concert and each member performs exactly one solo.
  - Restrictions:
    - Guitarist doesn't perform fourth solo.
    - Percussionist performs before keyboard player.
    - Keyboard player performs after violinist and before guitarist.
    - Saxophonist performs after percussionist or trumpeter, but not both.
  - If percussionist performs before saxophonist:
    - It doesn't imply who performs the first or last solo.
    - Violinist can perform before saxophonist.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - There are six members in the band: the guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, and violinist.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  - We are looking for a true statement given the assumption that the percussionist performs before the saxophonist does.

To have the percussionist perform before the saxophonist:
  - The percussionist cannot perform the last solo as that would mean that all 5 remaining members had already performed their solos before the percussionist, and there would have been no opportunity for the saxophonist to perform.
  - The percussionist cannot perform the fifth solo as the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both, and if the percussionist performed the fifth solo, then the trumpeter would have to perform the fourth solo, leaving no spot for the saxophonist.
  - Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
    - If the percussionist performed the first solo, then there would be no opportunity for the saxophonist to perform after the percussionist or the trumpeter (since they both have to perform after the percussionist), so this is not possible.
    - If the percussionist performed the second solo, then the saxophonist could perform after the percussionist, but there would still be no opportunity for the violinist to perform before the saxophonist (since the keyboard player has to perform after the violinist), so this is not possible.
    - If the percussionist performed the third solo, then the saxophonist could perform after the percussionist, and the violinist could perform before the saxophonist (since the keyboard player has to perform after the violinist and before the guitarist). Therefore, the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The six-member band performs solo in a concert.
  - Each member performs exactly one solo, means no member performs more than one solo.
  - The restrictions:
    - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
    - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
    - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
    
Action: 
  - If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then:
    - The percussionist could perform either the first, second, or third solo, as we know for sure the saxophonist will perform after them.
    - The violinist must perform a solo before the saxophonist. Hence, the option (C) is irrelevant.
    - Even though option (D) is possible, it is not a must.
    - Similarly, option (E) is not necessarily true.
    - Therefore, the answer is either (A) or (B). 
  - However, we are not sure which solo the percussionist performs. But, we know that the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, and the keyboard player performs before the guitarist. Therefore, the percussionist cannot perform the last solo (the sixth solo). Hence, the percussionist performs either the first, second, or third solo. As we already ruled out (C), the remaining answer is (B).
    
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are six members in the band, and each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist's solo must be the fifth or sixth solo. So, either the percussionist performs the first, second, or third solo. If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist's solo should be the sixth, which is not possible because the saxophonist's solo is after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist should perform the fifth solo, which is possible because the percussionist performs before the keyboard player and the keyboard player performs before the guitarist. Therefore, the answer is B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are six solos to be performed by each member of the band.
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist performs the solo that is not the fourth.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
  - If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, we do not know if the percussionist takes the first solo or the second solo. Therefore, options A and B are not necessarily true.
  - The keyboard player solo goes after the violinist solo, so the violinist solo cannot go after the saxophonist solo. Therefore, option C is not true.
  - Since the saxophonist solo goes after either the percussionist solo or the trumpeter solo, but not both, and we know that the percussionist solo goes before the saxophonist solo, it must be that the percussionist solo goes before the trumpeter solo. Therefore, option D is true.
  - There is no information to confirm or reject option E.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does:
    - The saxophonist's solo must occur after the percussionist's solo.
    - The percussionist's solo must occur before the keyboard player's solo.
    
Choice analysis:
  A. If the percussionist performs first, then the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist, violating a rule. Incorrect.
  B. The percussionist can perform second. This leaves three solos before the saxophonist performs. Correct.
  C. There is not enough information to determine when the violinist performs. Incorrect.
  D. It is not known when the trumpeter performs relative to the saxophonist. Incorrect.
  E. It is not known when the keyboard player performs relative to the saxophonist. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Six solos are performed by six members of the band.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Action: Answer("C")
  - If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does:
    - The saxophonist must perform the fifth or sixth solo.
    - The percussionist must perform the first, second, or third solo.
    - The keyboard player must perform a solo after the violinist's but before the guitarist's solo.
    - Therefore, the violinist must perform a solo before the saxophonist does.
  - Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A naturalist will give five lectures, each on a different type of bird: oystercatchers, petrels, rails, sandpipers, or terns. The lectures must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium, in an order that meets the following conditions: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  2. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  3. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  4. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  5. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
Analysis:
- From (1) and (3), we know that the first three lectures are in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
- From (4), we know that the lecture on oystercatchers is given later than the lecture on sandpipers, so the lecture on oystercatchers must be the fifth lecture.
- From (5), we know that the lecture on petrels is probably the last lecture because it is in Gladwyn Hall and given later than the lecture on terns, which is probably the second lecture.
- From (3), we know that the third lecture is also in Gladwyn Hall.

Action: Answer("D") 
Choice D is the only one that conflicts with the rule from (3) that says exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. First lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  2. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  3. Lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  4. Lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
   
A: If the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, the second lecture must be in Howard Auditorium because of the condition that three lectures must be in Gladwyn Hall. Hence, A must be false.  

B: The condition that exactly three lectures must be given in Gladwyn Hall, and the first lecture being in Gladwyn Hall make this condition impossible. Hence, B must be false.

C: The lecture on Sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers, which means that lecture on oystercatchers must be in Gladwyn Hall. Also, the lecture on petrels must be after the lecture on terns which is not in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the second and fifth lectures cannot be both in Gladwyn Hall. Hence, C is true.

D: The fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium, so the third lecture cannot also be in Howard Auditorium. Hence, D is true.

E: The second and fifth lectures cannot be both in Gladwyn Hall, and the third lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall since it is the lecture on petrels. Therefore, E is true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. 
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Analysis:
  From this information, we can deduce the following:
  - The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  - The lectures on sandpipers and oystercatchers are in Howard Auditorium.
  - The lecture on petrels is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - Exactly one more lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall, which will either be on rails or terns.
  - There cannot be any consecutive lectures in the same room, because the first and fourth lectures are in different locations.

Let's test each choice:
  A: It is possible for the first and second lectures to both be in Gladwyn Hall, so this is not necessarily false.
  B: It is possible for the second and third lectures to both be in Howard Auditorium, so this is not necessarily false.
  C: It is not possible for the second and fifth lectures to both be in Gladwyn Hall, because the lecture on terns must be earlier than the lecture on petrels, and the lecture on petrels is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, this must be false.
  D: It is possible for the third and fourth lectures to both be in Howard Auditorium, so this is not necessarily false.
  E: It is not possible for the third and fifth lectures to both be in Gladwyn Hall, because there can only be a maximum of three lectures in Gladwyn Hall, and we already know that the first, petrels, and either rails or terns are in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, this must be false.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
 The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
 The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
 Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
 The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
 The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Analysis:
 If we draw a table to visualize the conditions, we can eliminate the options that are impossible to occur.
 
 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th
-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
  G  |     |     |     |   *   --> The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and we have 3 more lectures to be scheduled in Gladwyn Hall.
  G  |     |  H  |     |   *
  G  |  H  |  H  |     |   *
  G  |  H  |  H  |  O  |  Sp  --> The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium and sandpipers are given earlier than oystercatchers. So oystercatchers cannot take place in the third lecture.
  T  |  G  |  H  |  O  |  Sp  --> The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. - Possible based on the conditions. This must be True.
B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. - Possible based on the conditions. This must be True.
C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. - Impossible because we only have three Gladwyn Hall slots available. This must be False.
D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. - Impossible because we need to schedule oystercatchers after sandpipers, and it is already scheduled in the fourth lecture. This must be False.
E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. - Possible based on the conditions. This must be True.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, so one of the lectures must be in Howard Auditorium.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
Analysis:
  Since the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, then the second or third lecture must also be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, options B, D, and E can be eliminated since they all have two lectures in Howard Auditorium. 
  Option A is also possible since we don't know where the second lecture will take place. However, it's not a must that the second lecture takes place in Gladwyn Hall, as long as it's not the fourth lecture. Therefore, option A is not false.
  Option C, however, cannot be true since the lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. If the fifth lecture (petrels) is in Gladwyn Hall, then the lecture on terns will be after the lecture on petrels. Therefore, this option must be false.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and the fourth is in Howard Auditorium.
  2. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, meaning two are in Howard Auditorium.
  3. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  4. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
Analysis:
  We can create a table to help us understand the constraints of the problem:
  
  | LECTURE | LOCATION | ORDER |
  |---------|----------|-------|
  | Oystercatchers | ? | 5 |
  | Petrels | Gladwyn Hall | 4 |
  | Rails | ? | ? |
  | Sandpipers | Howard Auditorium | 2 |
  | Terns | ? | ? |
  
  From constraint (1) we know that Lecture 1 is in Gladwyn Hall and Lecture 4 is in Howard Auditorium, so we can fill those in:
  
  | LECTURE | LOCATION | ORDER |
  |---------|----------|-------|
  | Oystercatchers | ? | 5 |
  | Petrels | Gladwyn Hall | 4 |
  | Rails | ? | ? |
  | Sandpipers | Howard Auditorium | 2 |
  | Terns | ? | 1 |
  
  From constraint (2), we know that exactly two lectures are in Howard Auditorium, so we can fill that in:
  
  | LECTURE | LOCATION | ORDER |
  |---------|----------|-------|
  | Oystercatchers | Gladwyn Hall | 5 |
  | Petrels | Gladwyn Hall | 4 |
  | Rails | Howard Auditorium | 3 |
  | Sandpipers | Howard Auditorium | 2 |
  | Terns | ? | 1 |
  
  From constraint (3), we know that Sandpipers is earlier than Oystercatchers, so Petrels must be Lecture 5, and Terns must be Lecture 3:
  
  | LECTURE | LOCATION | ORDER |
  |---------|----------|-------|
  | Oystercatchers | Gladwyn Hall | 5 |
  | Petrels | Gladwyn Hall | 4 |
  | Rails | Howard Auditorium | 3 |
  | Sandpipers | Howard Auditorium | 2 |
  | Terns | Gladwyn Hall | 1 |
  
  Now, we can check each of the answer choices to see if they violate any of the constraints:
  
  A: Both the first and second lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. This violates constraint (2), which says that exactly two lectures are in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, A must be false.
  B: Both the second and third lectures are in Howard Auditorium. This is consistent with the table we created, so B might be true.
  C: Both the second and fifth lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. This violates constraint (3), which says that Sandpipers is earlier than Oystercatchers. Since Oystercatchers is Lecture 5, it cannot be in Gladwyn Hall if Sandpipers is also in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, C must be false.
  D: Both the third and fourth lectures are in Howard Auditorium. This is consistent with the table we created, so D might be true.
  E: Both the third and fifth lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. This violates constraint (3), which says that Sandpipers is earlier than Oystercatchers. Since Oystercatchers is Lecture 5, it cannot be in Gladwyn Hall if Sandpipers is earlier. Therefore, E must be false.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The first lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium.
  Three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Analysis:
  If the second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium, then the fourth lecture cannot be in Howard Auditorium. So, B and D are not possible.
  If the third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall, then there must be at least four lectures in Gladwyn Hall and only one lecture in Howard Auditorium. But, we know that there must be three lectures in Gladwyn Hall and two lectures in Howard Auditorium. So, E is not possible.
  If the first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall, then there must be at least four lectures in Gladwyn Hall and only one lecture in Howard Auditorium. But, we know that there must be three lectures in Gladwyn Hall and two lectures in Howard Auditorium. So, A is not possible.
  The only remaining option is C.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  There are only five lectures.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions we can deduce that the following lectures should be given in the following order:
  1. Gladwyn Hall.
  2. Howard Auditorium.
  3. Gladwyn Hall.
  4. Howard Auditorium.
  5. Gladwyn Hall.
  
  A: The first and second lectures cannot be both in Gladwyn Hall because the second lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Thus, A must be false.
  B: The second and third lectures cannot be both in Howard Auditorium because the third lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. Thus, B must be false.
  C: The second and fifth lectures cannot be both in Gladwyn Hall because the fifth lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, which means that there are four lectures in Gladwyn Hall. Thus, C must be false.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium, which is consistent with the given order. Thus, D could be true.
  E: The third and fifth lectures cannot be both in Gladwyn Hall because the fourth lecture must necessarily be in Howard Auditorium. Thus, E must be false.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the five lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. 
  There are only five lectures, one on each type of bird.
  
Analysis:
  Let's try to eliminate each choice to see which one must be false.
  A: If the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, then the second lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall because exactly three of the five lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. So, this may be true.
  B: If the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, then the second and third lectures cannot be in Howard Auditorium. So, this may be true.
  C: If the lecture on terns is earlier than the lecture on petrels and the lecture on petrels is in Gladwyn Hall, then the lecture on terns cannot be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, this may be true.
  D: If the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, then the third lecture cannot be in Howard Auditorium because each lecture is about a different bird. So, this must be false.
  E: If the lecture on terns is earlier than the lecture on petrels and the lecture on terns is not in Gladwyn Hall, then the lecture on petrels cannot be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, this may be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers
  - The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
A: If the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, the second lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall since exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the first and second lectures could not both be in Gladwyn Hall. This could be true.
B: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. So, the second and third lectures cannot both be in Howard Auditorium. This could be true.
C: The lecture on petrels is in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels but the lecture on terns cannot be in Gladwyn Hall as exactly three lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the second and fifth lectures could not both be in Gladwyn Hall. This could be true.
D: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so the third lecture cannot be in Howard Auditorium. This could be true. 
E: The lecture on sandpipers must be in Howard Auditorium, so the lecture on oystercatchers must be after the lecture on sandpipers. The lecture on terns must be given earlier than the lecture on petrels, so both lectures cannot be in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the third and fifth lectures could not both be in Gladwyn Hall. This CANNOT be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Each wall will have exactly two paintings--one oil and one watercolor.
  - One painting will be in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Working through the conditions, we know that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2. This means that none of the other students' oils can be on wall 2. Since no wall can have only watercolors on it, this means that one of the watercolors has to be from Hidalgo, and the other has to be from either Greene or Isaacs. However, we know that Isaacs's oil is on wall 4, so it is impossible for Isaacs's watercolor to be on wall 2. This means that the watercolor on wall 2 must be either Hidalgo's or Greene's. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed on the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: According to the information given, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because then it will have only watercolors on it. Also, neither of the paintings by Franz or Isaacs can be displayed on wall 2 because it will violate condition 4. Therefore, Greene's oil painting can be displayed on wall 2.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- 4 students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, Isaacs. Each has 1 oil and 1 watercolor painting to be displayed.
- 2 paintings, 1 oil and 1 watercolor, will be displayed on each of the 4 walls with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
- Greene's watercolor should be in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
- If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, it means that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.

Analysis:
- If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the other painting on that wall must be either Franz's oil or Greene's watercolor.
- Greene's oil can't be displayed on wall 2 because then wall 4 would have Greene's watercolor and oil, which violates the rule "No wall has only watercolors displayed on it."
- Isaacs's watercolor can't be displayed on wall 2 because that would mean Isaacs's oil would have to be on wall 1 or 3. However, this would put both Franz and Isaacs on the same wall, which violates the rule "No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it."
- Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
- Therefore, the only option is that Franz's oil is also on wall 2.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  Wall 4's lower position has Isaacs's oil.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  
We need to determine which painting could be on Wall 2. If Hidalgo's oil is on Wall 2, then Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on Wall 2 (because Isaacs's oil goes on Wall 4 lower position). Therefore, Franz's oil has to be on Wall 2, and Greene's watercolor has to be on Wall 1 (because Franz's oil is on the wall with Greene's watercolor's upper position).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The students are Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student displays exactly one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  The watercolor painting of Greene is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which the oil painting of Franz is displayed.
  The oil painting of Isaacs is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on Wall 2, then we know that Wall 2 does not have Hidalgo's watercolor painting because Hidalgo cannot display both paintings on the same wall. Also, Wall 2 cannot have Franz's paintings (because no wall can have both Franz and Isaacs paintings). Therefore, Wall 2 will have the paintings of both Greene and Isaacs. Also, we know that Greene's watercolor will be displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Since Hidalgo's oil is on Wall 2, that means that Franz's oil must be displayed on Wall 1 (because no two students can display their paintings on the same wall). Therefore, Greene's watercolor painting should be displayed on Wall 2 with Hidalgo's oil painting. This means that choice B, which states that Greene's watercolor could also be displayed on Wall 2, is correct.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  According to the conditions given:
  - Each wall has exactly two paintings - one oil and one watercolor.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene’s watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz’s oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs’s oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, this means Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 to satisfy the condition "No wall has only watercolors displayed on it."
- If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 2, then according to the condition "No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it", Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 4 since Franz's oil is already on wall 2. Thus, Isaacs's watercolor has to be displayed on wall 4, but we know that Isaacs’s oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, this option is not possible.
- If Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then according to the condition "Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed", Franz's oil will be displayed in the lower position of wall 2. Then, Isaacs's oil has to be displayed on another wall since it cannot be displayed on wall 4, which would leave Isaacs's watercolor to be displayed on wall 4. Then Hidalgo's watercolor would be displayed on another wall, which satisfies all the conditions. So, this option is possible.
- If Greene's oil is displayed on wall 2, then according to the condition "No wall has only watercolors displayed on it", Hidalgo's watercolor has to be displayed on wall 2. But this violates the condition, "No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it." Since Hidalgo's oil is already on wall 2. Thus, this option is not possible.
- If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then according to the condition "No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it", Hidalgo's oil has to be displayed on another wall. Then, according to the condition "No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it", Isaacs's oil will be displayed on wall 4, which means that Isaacs's watercolor has to be displayed on wall 4. And this would leave Franz's oil to be displayed on the last wall, which would violate the condition, "No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it." Thus, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we know the following:
  - Wall 2 has one oil painting and one watercolor painting displayed on it.
  - Wall 2 does not have only watercolors displayed on it.
  - Wall 2 does not have only Hidalgo's work displayed on it.
  - Wall 2 does not have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - This means that either Franz or Isaacs must have a painting on Wall 2
  - We also know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, but we don't know which wall that is yet.
  - We know Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  A: Franz's oil cannot be displayed on Wall 2 because Wall 2 does not have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs. So, this is not possible.
  B: If Franz's oil is displayed on Wall 1, Greene's watercolor will be displayed in the upper position of Wall 1 (by condition above). This means that Greene's oil cannot be on Wall 2 because no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  C: If Franz's oil is displayed on Wall 3, Greene's watercolor will be displayed in the upper position of Wall 3. This means that Greene's oil can be on Wall 2 (since it is not on Wall 3), which is consistent with the conditions.
  D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on Wall 2 with Hidalgo's oil, no other student's work can be displayed on Wall 2. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on Wall 2, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on Wall 1 or Wall 3 (because Wall 4 already has Isaacs's oil displayed). If Isaacs's oil is displayed on Wall 1, then Greene's watercolor would be displayed in the upper position of Wall 1, which is not consistent with the conditions. If Isaacs's oil is displayed on Wall 3, then Franz's oil would be displayed in the upper position of Wall 3, which is also not consistent with the conditions. Therefore, this option is not possible.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  From the information given, we know:
  - Each student displays one oil and one watercolor.
  - There are 4 walls, each with one oil painting and one watercolor painting, in upper and lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolor.
  - No wall has only one student's work.
  - Franz, Isaacs cannot be on the same wall.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.

We need to determine what could be displayed on Wall 2 with Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: 
  - Franz's oil cannot be on Wall 2 because that would require Greene's watercolor to be on Wall 1, where both Isaacs's oil and watercolor would also have to be, leading to a violation of the rule that no wall has only one student's work displayed on it.
  - Greene's oil cannot be on Wall 2 for the same reason.
  - Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on Wall 2 because that would lead to a wall with only watercolors.
  - Isaacs's watercolor could be on Wall 2, satisfying all the given conditions.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Franz and Isaacs cannot both have a painting on the same wall.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2. 
  4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  5. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, we cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor on that wall. Also, since Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4, we cannot have Isaacs's watercolor on wall 2 either. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, we cannot have Greene's watercolor on wall 2. Therefore, the only option left is Franz's oil which can be displayed on wall 2. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Four students will display two paintings each, one oil and one watercolor. 
  2. Each of the four walls will have two paintings, one in upper position and one in the lower position.
  3. No wall can have only watercolors from one or more students.
  4. No wall can have paintings of only one student.
  5. There cannot be paintings of both Franz and Isaacs on one wall.
  6. On the wall where Franz's oil painting is displayed in the lower position, Greene's watercolor painting is displayed in the upper position.
  7. Isaacs's oil painting is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  8. Hidalgo's oil painting is displayed on wall 2.

Inference:
  1. We know that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, so the following must also apply:
  2. Wall 2 will have two paintings, one oil and one watercolor.
  3. One of the paintings cannot be Hidalgo's watercolor.
  4. One of the paintings cannot be a painting by either Franz or Isaacs, since none of their paintings can be displayed on the same wall with Hidalgo's oil painting.
  5. On the wall where Franz's oil painting is displayed in the lower position (which cannot be wall 2), Greene's watercolor painting is displayed in the upper position. Therefore, it is not possible for Greene's watercolor painting to be displayed on wall 2, since Hidalgo's oil painting is already on that wall.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Since one of the paintings on wall 2 cannot be a painting by Franz, Isaacs, or Hidalgo's watercolor, and Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2, the only option left is for Greene's oil painting to be displayed on wall 2 along with Hidalgo's oil painting. Therefore, Answer("C"), i.e. Greene's oil painting, could also be displayed on wall 2.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel.
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.

A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. -> It is possible that bay 2 is holding fuel, as long as bay 1 is holding grain which has a higher number than bay holding livestock, and bay 3 is holding textiles which is next to bay holding produce.
B: Bay 4 is holding produce. -> It is possible that bay 4 is holding produce, since it has a higher number than bay holding fuel and textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
C: Bay 4 is holding textiles. -> It is possible that bay 4 is holding textiles, since it has a lower number than the bay holding produce and a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
D: Bay 5 is holding grain. -> It is possible that bay 5 is holding grain, since it has a higher number than the bay holding livestock and lower than the bay holding produce.
E: Bay 5 is holding machinery. -> It is possible that bay 5 is holding machinery, since it has a lower number than the bay holding grain.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

First, let's determine the bays for each type of cargo based on the rules given:
- Fuel: Bay 1 or Bay 6 (Bay 1 is next to Bay 2, which holds fuel, so Bay 2 cannot hold fuel)
- Grain: Bay 5
- Livestock: Bay 4
- Machinery: Bay 2 or Bay 3 (Bay 1 holds fuel, Bay 4 holds livestock, and Bay 5 holds grain, so machinery must be in either Bay 2 or Bay 3)
- Produce: Bay 3 or Bay 6 (based on the rule that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, and since Bay 1 cannot hold produce)
- Textiles: The remaining bay (either Bay 1 or Bay 6, depending on where produce is located)

Now, let's go through each choice:
- A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. This could be true, as explained above.
- B: Bay 4 is holding produce. This cannot be true, because Bay 4 is already assigned to livestock, and produce is assigned to either Bay 3 or Bay 6.
- C: Bay 4 is holding textiles. This could be true, because textiles are assigned to either Bay 1 or Bay 6, and Bay 4 is not adjacent to either of those bays.
- D: Bay 5 is holding grain. This could be true, as explained above.
- E: Bay 5 is holding machinery. This could be true, as explained above.

Therefore, the answer is B: Bay 4 is holding produce. Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
- Six bays are numbered 1 through 6.
- Six types of cargo are fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
- Grain > Livestock; Livestock > Textiles.
- Produce > Fuel.
- Textiles is next to Produce (so their bays are next to each other).
- Each type of cargo is assigned to exactly one bay number.
- We need to find out which option CAN'T be true if produce and livestock are next to each other.

Method: 
- First, find the bay number of produce and livestock (because they are next to each other).
- Add the other given information to it.
- Check each option and see if it can be possible with the given information.

Working: 
- The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay number of produce and textiles are 3 and 4 in some order.
- The bay holding livestock is higher than textiles, so the bay number of livestock is the highest one, which is 6.
- The bay holding grain is higher than livestock, so the bay number of grain is either 5 or 4. (It can't be 6 because it's taken.)
- The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. So, fuel is either in bay 1 or 2.
- Let's check each option.

Option A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. This can be possible because produce is either in bay 3 or 4, and livestock is in bay 6. So, fuel can be in bay 1 or 2. Thus, this option is possible.
Option B: Bay 4 is holding produce. This can only be possible if the bay holding textiles is 3 and the bay holding produce is 4. But, the bay holding livestock should be next to it, which is not possible because livestock is in bay 6. So, this option is not possible.
Option C: Bay 4 is holding textiles. This is possible because the bay holding produce is 3 in this case and livestock is in bay 6.
Option D: Bay 5 is holding grain. This can be possible because the bay holding produce is in bay 3 and livestock is in bay 6. Thus, grain can be in bay 4 or 5. So, this option is possible.
Option E: Bay 5 is holding machinery. This is not possible because machinery is not assigned to any bay number.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are six bays numbered 1 through 6.
  There are six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  Grain > Livestock
  Livestock > Textiles
  Produce > Fuel
  Textiles is next to Produce
  
  If Produce is next to Livestock, then Livestock must be in bay 3 or 4 and Produce must be in bay 4 or 5. 
  
Analysis:
  A: Bay 2 has to be holding textiles or produce, neither of which is fuel. A is possible.
  B: If Produce is in bay 4, then this is possible.
  C: This is possible given that Textiles is next to the bay holding Produce.
  D: This is possible given that we don't know if Grain is in bay 1 or 2.
  E: It is possible that Machinery is in bay 5.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six bays, numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  - There are exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - Grain > Livestock, Livestock > Textiles, Produce > Fuel
  - Textiles is next to Produce
  - Produce is next to Livestock
Logic: 
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then bay 3 must be holding livestock and bay 4 must be holding produce.
  - A can be true. There is no restriction about bay 2 holding fuel.
  - B can be true. Produce is in bay 4 in one of the scenarios.
  - C can be true. Textiles can be in bay 5 in one of the scenarios.
  - D cannot be true. Grain must be in a higher-numbered bay than Livestock, so Grain cannot be in bay 5.
  - E can be true. There is no restriction about machinery not being in bay 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
- There are six bays numbered consecutively from 1 to 6.
- There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
- Grain has a higher number than livestock.
- Livestock has a higher number than textiles.
- Produce has a higher number than fuel.
- Textiles is next to produce.
- Produce is next to livestock.

A: No information is given about bay 2, so it could be holding fuel.
B: This is possible. As per the given condition, the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so bay 4 could be holding produce.
C: This is possible. As per the given condition, the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so bay 4 could be holding textiles.
D: This is possible. As per the given condition, grain has a higher number than livestock, so bay 5 could be holding grain.
E: This is not possible. If grain is located at bay 5, it means that livestock will be located at a lower number bay, which violates the previously stated condition that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  5. There are 6 types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  6. There are 6 bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  
Analysis:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then we know the following:
  - Livestock is not in bay 1 and 2.
  - Produce is not in bay 5 and 6.
  - Textiles cannot be in bay 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. It is possible because we do not have any information about which bay holds fuel.
  
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce. It is possible because we know that produce has a higher number than fuel, livestock, and textiles.
  
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles. It is possible because textiles cannot be in bays 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain. It is possible because grain has to be in a lower numbered bay than livestock, which has to be in a lower numbered bay than textiles and produce.
  
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery. It is not possible because machinery has to be in a lower numbered bay than textiles and produce, but grain, livestock, and fuel all have to be in lower numbered bays than machinery.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
 - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
 - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
 - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
 - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
 - If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then they are in bays 3 and 4, in some order.
Analysis:
 - A: Bay 2 could hold fuel, as it is not restricted by the given conditions.
 - B: Bay 4 could hold produce, if produce is in bay 6 and textiles is in bay 5.
 - C: Bay 4 could hold textiles, if produce is in bay 6 and textiles is in bay 5.
 - D: Bay 5 could hold grain, if grain is in bay 1 and textiles is in bay 2.
 - E: Bay 5 could hold machinery, if textiles is in bay 4 and produce is in bay 6.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Grain has a higher number than Livestock.
  2. Livestock has a higher number than Textiles.
  3. Produce has a higher number than Fuel
  4. Textiles are next to Produce.
  5. There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  6. There are six bays numbered consecutively from 1 to 6.

Analysis: 
  We know that Produce is next to Livestock, so Produce must be in bay 4 or bay 5. If Produce is in bay 4, then Livestock must be in bay 3, which means Textiles must be in bay 2, and Grain must be in bay 1. If Produce is in bay 5, then Livestock must be in bay 6, which means Textiles must be in bay 4, and Fuel must be in bay 2. We need to check each statement to see which one cannot be true with this setup.

A: Bay 2 is holding Fuel. - This could be true.
B: Bay 4 is holding Produce. - This is true for the second setup.
C: Bay 4 is holding Textiles. - This is true for the second setup.
D: Bay 5 is holding Grain. - This is not possible for either setup because Grain has to be in a lower numbered bay than Livestock.
E: Bay 5 is holding Machinery. - This could be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
- The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
- The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
- The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
If bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the order must be either: 2 3 1 (livestock, textile, grain) or 3 2 1 (livestock, textile, grain). In either of these cases, the bay holding produce cannot be in bay 4. Therefore, the statement in option C is false, and the correct answer is C.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies to be shown: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  There are three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each at 7 P.M. and 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi are shown on the same screen, then either:
  1. Western is shown on screen 3 and Sci-fi is shown on either screen 1 or 2
     - In this scenario, romance can't be on screen 2 because it can't be on the same screen as Western. So, it must be on screen 1, which means either Horror or Mystery is on screen 2. 
     - However, Horror and Mystery cannot be on the same screen. Hence, this scenario is not possible.
  2. Western is shown on either screen 1 or 2 and Sci-fi is shown on the other screen
     - In this scenario, it is possible for Romance to be shown on screen 3 and Horror and Mystery to be shown on the two remaining screens.
     - The timing of each movie is not specified in this scenario.
     - So, A, B, D, E cannot be determined with certainty.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  We are given information about the movies showing at the repertory theater and the screens on which they are shown, along with the time slots. We are also given some constraints on the scheduling as follows:
  1. The western begins at some time before the horror film does
  2. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3
  3. The romance is not shown on screen 2
  4. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens
  From these constraints, we need to determine which statement could be true if the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen, then they must be on either screen 1 or screen 2. Since the western begins before the horror film, and the horror film is not on screen 2, it must be on screen 1. That means the mystery must be on screen 2. Since the romance is not on screen 2, it must be on screen 3. That means the sci-fi film cannot be on screen 3, so it must be on screen 1. Therefore, the sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M., which is possible according to the constraints given. So, the correct choice is D.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  - If the western and sci-fi are shown on the same screen, then neither can be on screen 3.
  - Therefore, the western and sci-fi must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2.
  - The western begins before the horror film, so the western must be shown at 7 P.M.
  - The sci-fi cannot be shown at 7 P.M., so the sci-fi must be shown at 9 P.M.
  - Therefore, the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 3, and the romance must be shown on the other screen.
  - The mystery begins at 9 P.M., so it cannot be shown on screen 3.
  - The romance cannot be shown on screen 2.
  - Therefore, A, B, and C are not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - There are three screens: 1, 2, and 3.
  - Screen 1 and 2 show movies at 7 P.M. and 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows one movie at 8 P.M.
  - Western starts before horror.
  - Sci-fi is not shown on screen 3.
  - Romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - Horror and mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  - If the western and sci-fi are scheduled on the same screen, the remaining movies (horror, romance, mystery) must be shown on the other two screens.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2, thus it must be shown on screen 1.
  - Horror and mystery are shown on different screens, and the romance is on screen 1 (7 P.M.), so the mystery must be on screen 2 (9 P.M.) and horror on the remaining screen, screen 2 (7 P.M.). 
  - Sci-fi is not on screen 3, so it must also be on screen 2 (9 P.M.).
  - The western starts before the horror, thus the western cannot be at 9 P.M. and must be at 7 P.M.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are 5 movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screen 1 and 2 show 2 movies each.
  Screen 3 shows just one movie.
  The western starts before the horror.
  The sci-fi is not in screen 3.
  The romance is not in screen 2.
  The horror and the mystery are shown on different screens.

We need to find a possible option based on the given conditions. 

If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then only Screen 1 and 2 are possible options. 

Western can not be in Screen 2 because Romance can not be in that screen. And, the only Screen left is Screen 1. 

So, Western should be shown on Screen 1 and Sci-fi is also on Screen 1. 

If the western begins before Sci-fi, then Western should be in 7 PM show, in the first movie before Sci-fi. This means that Sci-fi is in the 9 PM show. Also, since the horror and mystery are shown on different screens, there are only two valid arrangements for Screen 1 and 2 schedule:
### Screen 1
7 PM: Western
9 PM: Sci-Fi

### Screen 2
7 PM: Horror
9 PM: Mystery

OR

### Screen 1
7 PM: Western
9 PM: Mystery

### Screen 2
7 PM: Horror
9 PM: Sci-Fi

In both cases, Romance and Sci-Fi cannot be on the same screen, so they can not be on Screen 3. 

Option A is not possible because Horror is either on Screen 1 or Screen 2. 

Option B is possible, because Mystery is on Screen 2. 

Option C is not possible because Romance is not in Screen 2. 

Option D is not possible because Sci-Fi is in the 9 PM show. 

Option E is not possible because Western is in the 7 PM show.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.

Analysis:
  If the western and sci-fi film are on the same screen, and the sci-fi film cannot be on screen 3, then either the western must be on screen 3 or else it is on screen 1 or 2. If the western is on screen 3, then the sci-fi film cannot be on screen 1 or 2, and so must be on screen 3, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, it must be the case that the western and sci-fi film are on screen 1 or 2, and the other 3 movies are on the other screen and screen 3. 
  We can also infer that the horror film cannot be on the same screen as the mystery; therefore, if the western and sci-fi film are on the same screen, they must be shown with the mystery. Since the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, it must be shown with the western and the mystery, all of which must be on screen 1 or 2. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.

Analysis:
  - If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen, they must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  - If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1 or 2, it cannot be shown at 7 P.M. because the romance is not shown on screen 2 and screen 1 and 2 show two movies each.
  - Therefore, the sci-fi film is shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1 or 2.
  - If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1, then the western is shown on screen 2, and vice versa.
  - The horror film must be shown after the western, so it cannot be shown on screen 1.
  - Therefore, the western is shown on screen 1 or 2 at 7 P.M., and the horror film is shown at 9 P.M. on the other screen.
  - This leaves screen 3 to show the mystery or the romance at 8 P.M.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
- The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
- The romance is not shown on screen 2.
- The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
- Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.

If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen:
- The western is not shown on screen 3.
- The horror film is not shown on the same screen as the sci-fi film.
- The only screen that has one movie showing is screen 3.
- Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film must be scheduled to be shown on the same screen in either screen 1 or screen 2.
- The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the horror film cannot be shown on the same screen as the western and the sci-fi film.
- The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it has to be either shown on screen 1 or screen 3. 
- The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it has to be either shown on screen 1 or screen 2.

A: The horror film is shown on screen 2. - This is not possible because the romance is not shown on screen 2. So, A is eliminated.
B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M. - This is possible, but we cannot determine this based on the given information.
C: The romance is shown on screen 3. - This is not possible because the western and the sci-fi film are not shown on screen 3. So, C is eliminated.
D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M. - This is possible. So, the answer is D.
E: The western begins at 8 P.M. - This is not possible because screen 3 only shows one movie at 8 P.M., and the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. So, E is eliminated.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
- Three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
- Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
- Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each: one at 7 P.M. and one at 9 P.M.
- The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
- The romance is not shown on screen 2.
- The western begins before the horror film does.
- The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.

To consider the answer choices:
- (A) The horror film and the mystery film are shown on different screens, so it cannot be on screen 2 with the western and sci-fi films.
- (B) If the mystery film begins at 9 P.M., then its screen will also show the western or sci-fi film because those movies begin at the same time on the same screen. But the horror film and mystery film cannot be on the same screen, so this cannot be true.
- (C) The romance film cannot be shown on screen 2, so it can be shown on screen 1 or screen 3, but this doesn't affect whether the western and sci-fi films can be shown on the same screen.
- (D) The sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M. because it is not shown on screen 3 and screen 1 already has movies scheduled at 7 P.M. This cannot be true.
- (E) If the western begins at 8 P.M., then it can be shown on screen 3 with the sci-fi film, which is not shown on screen 3. This could be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  2. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  3. The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  4. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
First, we know that the western and sci-fi are on the same screen. We need to determine what could be true. 
If the western starts later than the horror, it cannot be shown at 7 PM, meaning it must be shown at 9 PM. 
If the western starts at 9 PM and is shown with the sci-fi film, the sci-fi film must also be shown at 9 PM. 
The horror film and the mystery must be shown on different screens so the horror film cannot be shown on screen 2, which eliminates option A. 
The romance is not shown on screen 2, which eliminates option C. 
The western starting at 8 PM would mean the horror film would start later, which contradicts the first rule. 
The mystery beginning at 9 PM could be true, so the answer is B.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: Which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one?
Choices:
  A: Yardsign
  B: Vegemite, Wellspring
  C: Vegemite, Yardsign
  D: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign
  E: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, Zircon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots and Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, Uneasy will be in either slot 4, 5, or 6 and Yardsign will be in either slot 1, 2, or 3. 
  We know that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. 

Analysis: 
  For Slot 1, Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, leaving Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, and Zircon for the remaining slots. 
  From the constraints, we know that Vegemite has to be in an earlier slot than Zircon. 
  We know that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. 
  Therefore, the only bands that can perform in slot 1 are the bands that are earlier than Xpert, and since Yardsign is already performing in a slot of the first three, the answer should include Yardsign.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We are looking for the list of bands that could perform in slot one.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots; this means that it is possible for Yardsign to perform in slot 1.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, this means that if Zircon does not perform on slot 1, it is possible for Vegemite to perform on slot 1.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, this means that if Xpert performs in slot 6, it is possible for both Wellspring and Zircon to perform on slots 1 or 2.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, this means that it is not possible for Uneasy to perform in slot 1. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The order of the bands must meet the following constraints:
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
To determine which bands could perform in slot one, we need to consider the constraint related to Yardsign, which says that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Therefore, any list of bands that includes Yardsign could be the one to perform in slot one.

The only list that includes Yardsign among the options is D: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign. Therefore, that is the answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The list must comply with all the conditions.
  The information given does not exclude any of the options.
  Slots 2-6 must be filled by the remaining bands after slot 1 is filled.
  From the given constraints, Yardsign must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  From the given constraints, Xpert must perform somewhere between the slots for Wellspring and Zircon. 
  There are no other constraints on the order that the bands perform in.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six.
  Constraints: 
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
    
Analysis:
- To be valid for slot one, the band must be in one of the first three slots and meet all the constraints.
- Only A and C have a band in the first three slots (Yardsign).
- In option A, Yardsign is the only band that satisfies the constraints.
- In option C, both Vegemite and Yardsign satisfies the constraints, but having only Yardsign is enough.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  We need to find the set of bans that could be in slot one
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
Analysis:
  First, we can eliminate Uneasy and Xpert as possible options, since Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots and Xpert plays after Wellspring and Zircon.
  Given that Yardsign has to play in one of the first three slots and Vegemite must perform before Zircon, the only groups that can possibly play the first slot are the ones that have Vegemite, Wellspring, and/or Yardsign.

A: Yardsign - Yardsign is a possible choice, but it is the only band, so it cannot be a 'list'.
B: Vegemite, Wellspring - This is a possible list, because the requirements would allow either of these two bands to perform in Slot 1.
C: Vegemite, Yardsign - This is a possible list, because the requirements would allow either of these two bands to perform in Slot 1.
D: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign - This is a possible list, because the requirements would allow any of these three bands to perform in Slot 1.
E: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, Zircon - The requirements would not allow Zircon to perform first.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: For the band that performs in slot one, we need to find a list of bands that meet the following constraints:
- Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.

Option A: Yardsign is one of the bands that could perform in the first three slots, however, we need a complete list of bands for slot one.
Option B: According to the constraints, Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so it is not possible for Wellspring to perform in slot one. Vegemite can perform in slot one because it performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
Option C: Vegemite and Yardsign meet the constraints, but there is no other band in the list that could perform in slot one.
Option D: Vegemite and Yardsign meet the constraints, and Wellspring can perform in slot one because it also performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
Option E: All bands meet the constraints, but there are too many bands to perform in just six slots.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The bands must be ordered from earliest to latest in six slots numbered slot one through slot six.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  To fill slot one, the band must be one that performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  
A: Yardsign cannot be in slot one because the bands for slot two and three must perform in an earlier slot than the band for slot one.
B: Vegemite and Wellspring can both be in an earlier slot than Xpert, however, the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots is not satisfied.
C: Vegemite can be in an earlier slot than Xpert and Yardsign can be in one of the first three slots.
D: Vegemite and Wellspring can both be in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Yardsign can be in one of the first three slots.
E: Vegemite and Wellspring can both be in an earlier slot than Xpert, Yardsign can be in one of the first three slots, and Zircon cannot be in slot one because Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  We are looking for a list of bands that could perform in Slot One.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots so it could perform in Slot One.
  Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
Action: Answer("D")  
Reasoning: 
  According to the given constraints, Yardsign can perform in Slot One.
  According to the given constraints, Vegemite can perform in Slot One if Wellspring is not in Slot One.
  According to the given constraints, Wellspring can perform in Slot One if Vegemite is not in Slot One.
  Therefore, Vegemite and Wellspring could perform in Slot One together.
  Yardsign, Vegemite, and Wellspring could all perform in Slot One together.
  Thus, the answer is D.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
- The band that performs in slot one must be one of the bands that can perform in the first three slots.
- From the given constraints, Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, and Zircon are the only bands that can perform in the first three slots.
- There is no constraint that excludes any of these bands from performing in slot one.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then the top shelf cannot contain L or H, which means that F and K must be on the top shelf, since K is on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, M and O must be on the middle shelf, and G and H must be on the bottom shelf. Since I must be on the middle shelf and F is on the top shelf, the only option left is for L to be on the bottom shelf.
Action: Answer("A") - F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
If L is placed on a shelf higher than H, then L must be either on the top or middle shelf, while H must be either on the middle or bottom shelf. Therefore, we can deduce that H is on the bottom shelf because there are already two books (I and F/M) on the middle shelf. If H is on the bottom shelf, then G and K (which are on a higher shelf than H) must also be on the bottom shelf. This means that O and L must be on the top or middle shelf, and since O is on a higher shelf than L, we can conclude that O must be on the middle shelf and L must be on the top shelf. Hence, the only statement that must be true is: 
Answer("E") K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - More books on bottom than top shelf.
  - I on middle shelf.
  - K is placed on higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - There are exactly three shelves.
  - At least two books are on each shelf.
  
Comparing L and H is difficult, so let's rephrase this as: 
If H is placed on a lower shelf than L, then which must be true?
Knowledge:
  - If H is on a lower shelf than L, then H cannot be on the top shelf, and L cannot be on the bottom shelf. 
  - If H is on the middle shelf, then I and L would be on different shelves, which is not possible.
  - Therefore, H is on the bottom shelf and L is on the middle shelf or top shelf.

Let's consider each choice:
  A: There is no condition that relates F and G to each other or to L and H, so this is not necessarily true. 
  B: There is no condition that relates G and H to each other or to L and H, so this is not necessarily true.
  C: If H is on the bottom shelf, then M cannot be on the bottom shelf, so this is not necessarily true.
  D: If G is on the middle or top shelf, then I and G would be on different shelves, which is not possible. Therefore, G is on the bottom shelf with H and L on the other two shelves. Therefore, I is on the top shelf with F and M, making this answer true.
  E: If K and O are on the same shelf, then neither can be on the bottom shelf. This contradicts the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, this is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf or bottom shelf. This means that O and K must be on the top and middle shelf in some order. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, F must be on the bottom shelf. This leaves us with only one shelf arrangement: 

Top shelf: O or K
Middle shelf: I or L
Bottom shelf: F, G, H, M

A: It is possible that F and G are on the same shelf, but not necessarily true for all cases.
B: It is possible that G and H are on the same shelf, but not necessarily true for all cases.
C: It is not possible for H and M to be on the same shelf, as H is on the top shelf and M is on the bottom shelf.
D: It is possible that I and G are on the same shelf, but not necessarily true for all cases.
E: K and O are on the top and middle shelf in some order, so it is not necessarily true that they are on the same shelf.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly three shelves - top, middle and bottom.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K > F.
  - O > L.
  - F = M.
  - L > H.
  
Analysis:
  - Since L is higher than H, we know that L is on the top shelf and H is on the middle or bottom shelf.
  - Since I is on the middle shelf, we know that H is on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F = M, we know that F and M are on the same shelf as H.
  - Since K > F, K cannot be on the same shelf as F.
  - Since O > L, O cannot be on the same shelf as L.
  - Since there are only three shelves, we can deduce that K and O must be on the same shelf.
 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) are placed on 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are on each shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
If L is on a shelf higher than H, then H must be on the bottom shelf. Since we know I is on the middle shelf, that leaves only the top shelf available for L. If F and M are on the same shelf, and F is on a lower shelf than L, then F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. This means that H, G, and O must be on the top shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, K and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. That leaves only shelf middle for K and L, which means F and M are on the bottom shelf. Therefore, H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. The correct answer is C.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - Exactly 3 shelves.
  - At least 2 books on each shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

Action: 
  First we must set up a diagram to help us visualize the problem, as this is a logic problem:
  
  Top shelf:      F   G
  Middle shelf:   I   ?
  Bottom shelf:   L   M   K   O
  
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then we have two possibilities:
  
  1. H is on the top shelf and L is on the middle or bottom shelf.
  2. H is on the middle shelf and L is on the bottom shelf.
  
  However, we know that more books are on the bottom shelf than top shelf, so possibility 1 is not valid. Therefore, we know that H is on the middle shelf and L is on the bottom shelf. 
  
  We also know that I is on the middle shelf, K is on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, the only choice that must be true is:
  
  Choice C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. 
  
  Answer: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  We have eight books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  We have three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  Conditions:
    1. More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
    2. I is placed on the middle shelf.
    3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
    4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
    5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on:
    - Since there are only three shelves, H must be on the bottom shelf.
    - Therefore, L must be on the top or middle shelf.
    - From condition 4, O must be on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf.
    - From condition 5, F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F must be on the middle shelf.
    - From condition 3, K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf and G must be on the bottom shelf.
    - From condition 2, I is placed on the middle shelf, so H must be on the bottom shelf.
    - Therefore, G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly eight books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) are placed on three shelves (top, middle, bottom) with at least two books on each shelf.
  - Bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed higher than F.
  - O is placed higher than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - If L is placed higher than H, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the top or middle shelf.
  - If H is on the bottom shelf, then M and F cannot be on the same shelf as H, so they must be on the top or middle shelf. 
  - If F and M are on the same shelf, then K and O must be on the bottom shelf.
  - Thus, K and O are on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.

To determine which statement must be true if L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, we need to consider the possible placement of L on the shelves.

If L is on the top shelf, then H must also be on the top shelf, which is not possible given that there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, L cannot be on the top shelf.

If L is on the middle shelf, then I must be on the top shelf. However, there will be no available shelf for K and O to be placed on a higher shelf than L and O respectively. Therefore, L cannot be on the middle shelf.

Therefore, L must be on the bottom shelf, and so H must also be on the bottom shelf. This means that M and F must also be on the bottom shelf since F is placed on the same shelf as M. This leaves only the top shelf for G. 

As a result of this, we can conclude that:
Action: Answer("B") G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: The assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  E: Xu is assigned parking space #5.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young > Togowa
  Xu > Souza
  Robertson > Young
  Robertson -> 1, 2, 3, or 4
  A: Assigning Souza to space #1 does not fully determine the assignments of all the other employees.
  B: Assigning Young to space #2 does not fully determine the assignments of all the other employees.
  C: Assigning Vaughn to space #3 does not fully determine the assignments of all the other employees.
  D: Assigning Robertson to space #4 fully determines the assignments of all the other employees. Following the rules, Robertson -> 4, Young -> 5, Togowa -> 6, Xu -> 3, Souza -> 2, and Vaughn -> 1.
  E: Assigning Xu to space #5 does not fully determine the assignments of all the other employees.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The six new employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young) must be assigned one of six parking spaces (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6) with no two employees assigned to the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 fully and uniquely determines the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees. Once we know that Robertson is assigned parking space #4, we can use the other rules to deduce that Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6. Then, we can use the remaining rule (Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza) to deduce that Xu must be assigned parking space #3 and Souza must be assigned parking space #2. Lastly, we can deduce that Vaughn must be assigned parking space #1. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The order of parking space assignments for each employee is unique.
  Young > Togowa
  Xu > Souza
  Robertson > Young
  Robertson must be #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  Using the given rules, 
  Robertson > Young > Togowa
  Xu > Souza
  Robertson >  # Young > Togowa > (Unknown) > Xu > Souza
  Robertson has to be assigned a parking space among #1, #2, #3, or #4. The assignment of parking space #5 or #6 to Vaughn has no effect on the order of assignments for the remaining employees.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6.
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned only one parking space.
  Young's parking space > Togowa's parking space.
  Xu's parking space > Souza's parking space.
  Robertson's parking space > Young's parking space.
  Robertson's parking space must be #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis: 
  If Robertson has parking space #4, then Young's parking space must be #5 and Xu's parking space must be #6. 
  If Robertson has parking space #3, then Young's parking space must be #4, Xu's parking space must be #5, and Togowa's parking space must be #6. 
  If Robertson has parking space #2, then Young's parking space must be #3, Xu's parking space must be #4, Togowa's parking space must be #5, and Souza's parking space must be #6. 
  If Robertson has parking space #1, then Young's parking space must be #2, Xu's parking space must be #3, Togowa's parking space must be #4, Souza's parking space must be #5, and Vaughn's parking space must be #6.

Action: Answer("D") 
  Only if Robertson is assigned parking space #4, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees will be fully and uniquely determined.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 (because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young). Also, since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson has already gotten one of the first four spots, Xu must be assigned parking space #5 and Souza must be assigned parking space #6. Finally, since Young and Togowa must be assigned spaces #5 and #6 in some order, Young must get space #5 and Togowa must get space #6. Therefore, each employee has been assigned a parking space, and the assignment is unique.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. 
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees are assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Robertson is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than #4, then he/she cannot be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, violating one of the rules. If Robertson is assigned parking space #5 or #6, then Xu must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space, violating one of the rules. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #4, which will allow us to uniquely determine the parking spaces of all the other employees, based on the given rules.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The rules governing the assignment of parking spaces are:
    - Young must have a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    - Xu must have a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    - Robertson must have a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: The assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if which one of the following is true?
Analysis:
  From the rules, we know that Robertson must have a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned either space #3 or #4, and Young must be assigned either space #5 or #6. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned either space #5 or #6. Since Robertson must be assigned either space #3 or #4, and Xu must be assigned either space #5 or #6, it follows that either Souza or Vaughn must be assigned space #1 or #2. 
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Six new employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space such as #5 or #6, then there would be more than one possible arrangement of the parking spaces, so the assignment of parking spaces would not be fully and uniquely determined. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, which determines a unique arrangement of parking spaces that meets all the given conditions.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- There are 6 employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
- Each employee must be assigned a different parking space, from #1 to #6.
- Rules for parking space assignments:
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4

To answer the question, we need to determine which rule will uniquely determine the assignments of parking spaces to the six employees.

Analysis:
- We know Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so let's start with that.
- If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 according to the rule "Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young". In this case, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #3, leaving Togowa to be assigned parking space #1 and Vaughn to be assigned parking space #2. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces would be fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
- If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4, according to the rule "Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young". However, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, leaving only one parking space for Souza, and that would be #4, contradicting the rule. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #3.
- Similarly, we can analyze the cases for Robertson being assigned parking spaces #2 and #1, but in both cases, we will reach contradictions with the rules.

Therefore, the only valid answer is D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are six employees and six parking spaces, and each employee must be assigned a different parking space.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
Response 0:
Knowledge: The panel must include at least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, and zoologist). If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
If both G and H are selected, then the panel must include either F or K. If F is selected, then at least one botanist and one chemist will be in the panel. If K is selected, then at least one chemist and one zoologist will be in the panel. But the panel also has to include at least one botanist, so the only option is to select F. Therefore, the panel must include F or else K.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  To form a panel, we must select 5 scientists from 3 botanists, 3 chemists, and 3 zoologists, subject to the following conditions:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist from each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.

Since the question asks about a situation where both G and H are selected, then we know that only one botanist can be selected. Thus, we can eliminate option A, which includes either F or K, and option B, which includes either F or M.

Option C includes K or M. Since we already know that K and M cannot both be selected, then the only possibility is to include K.

Option D includes M or else Q. But we cannot select M since we already selected K and they cannot both be on the panel. Thus, we are left with Q. However, we have not yet satisfied the condition that if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. Therefore, we cannot select M.

Option E includes P or else Q. Since we cannot select M, then we must select P and R to satisfy the requirement that if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types: botanists, chemists, and zoologists.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Based on the given conditions, if both G and H are selected for the panel, then F, K, and L must not be selected since F and K cannot be selected together, and K and M cannot be selected together. Additionally, only one botanist can be selected if both G and H are already selected. Therefore, the only possibility is that the panel includes M and at least one of the zoologists P or R.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then there are only two remaining spots, one choice is a botanist, and the other choice is either a chemist or a zoologist.
  
  If F is not selected, then there must be at least two botanists selected. But this is not possible, because if there are more than one botanist selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  
  If K is not selected, then M must be selected, and consequently, P and R must both be selected. Then there will be no room for a botanist, so both G and H cannot be selected.
  
  If M is not selected, then P and R cannot both be selected, so they cannot be the two remaining spots. Then the two remaining spots must be a botanist and a chemist. But F and K cannot both be selected, so either F or K must be included. When both G and H are selected, there are only two spots left, so M and L cannot both be selected. Therefore, the remaining choice must be F or else M.
  
  A: F and K cannot both be selected, so this is not guaranteed.
  B: F cannot be simultaneously selected with M, so this is not guaranteed.
  C: If K is not selected, then this is guaranteed. Otherwise, M cannot be selected with K.
  D: Q cannot be selected without R, so this is not guaranteed.
  E: This is not guaranteed.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  3. F and K cannot both be selected.
  4. K and M cannot both be selected.
  5. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then only one botanist can be selected. This is because the panel must include at least one scientist of each type, so if both G and H are selected (both zoologists), then at least one botanist must also be selected. However, if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected (from condition 2). So, we know that the panel will include G and H, and at most one botanist. 

If we assume that F is not selected, then the only possible botanist is either K or M. But we know from condition 3 that F and K cannot both be selected, so if G and H are selected, then F must be included and K cannot be selected. We also know from condition 4 that K and M cannot both be selected, so if F is included, then M must also be included.

Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include F or else M.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist from each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists). 
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. 
  F and K cannot both be selected. 
  K and M cannot both be selected. 
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If both G and H are selected, at least one botanist must also be selected. 

Solution: 
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, at least one botanist must also be selected. 
  If F is not selected, then at least two zoologists must be selected because there must be at least one scientist from each of the three types and at most one zoologist is selected if more than one botanist is selected. 
  If K is not selected, then either F or M must be selected, and if F is selected, then at least one zoologist must be selected which would break the condition of at most one zoologist. 
  Therefore, M must be selected and since K and M cannot both be selected, K cannot be selected. 
  Also, since M is selected, both P and R must be selected. 
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or M. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and at least one zoologist.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then at least one botanist and one zoologist must be selected. This means, we can exclude choices C and D.
  Also, we cannot select both F and K, which means we can rule out choice A.
  This leaves us with only two choices: B and E.
  Choice B says we need to select F or M. But we know that if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. So, in this case, we can have at most one botanist. Therefore, we cannot select F and M together. Thus, we can rule out choice B.
  This leaves us with only one choice: E.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  We need to find the valid options that follow the given conditions:
  - At least one scientist of each of the three types must be included.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Solution: 
  If both G and H are among the selected scientists, then we must have at least one botanist that will satisfy the condition of having at least one scientist of each of the three types. Suppose we select F, since there is no other constraint about F. Then we have three cases:

  Case 1: F and G are selected
  In this case, we cannot select more than one zoologist, because if we do, we will violate the condition "If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected." Then we can have only one zoologist, and it can be either P or R. Also, we cannot select K because "F and K cannot both be selected." If we select L, then we will have a chemist of each type, and this is a valid panel.

  Case 2: F and H are selected
  In this case, we cannot select more than one zoologist, because if we do, we will violate the condition "If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected." Hence we can have only one zoologist, and it can be either P or R. Also, we cannot select M because "K and M cannot both be selected." If we select L, then we will have a chemist of each type, and this is a valid panel.

  Case 3: G and H are selected
  In this case, we must select at least one botanist, and it can be either F or K, because "If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected." Since we cannot select M, we must select both P and R. Then we can select L to get a chemist of each type, and this is a valid panel.

  As we have found valid panels for all three cases, the answer is not unique. The choices that fulfill the conditions are (A) F or else K, (B) F or else M, and (C) K or else M.
  
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B") or Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R.
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Explanation: 
  If both G and H are among the selected scientists, then we have the following options for each type of scientist:
  Botanists: We can select at most one botanist, and we need at least one botanist on the panel. Therefore, we either select F or we do not select any botanist at all.
  Chemists: We cannot select both K and M. Therefore, we either select K or M, or we select L.
  Zoologists: If we selected M, then we must also select both P and R. Therefore, we either select P or R, or we do not select any zoologist at all.
  To summarize, if both G and H are among the selected scientists, then the panel must include either F or K, and the panel must also include either M or P and R. This means that the panel can be one of the following:
  {F, G, M, P, R}, {F, G, L, M, P}, {F, G, L, M, R}, {K, G, M, P, R}, {K, G, L, M, P}, {K, G, L, M, R}.
  Therefore, the correct answer is (A) F or else K
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - The question asks what the panel must include if both G and H are among the scientists selected.
  
Logic: 
  - If G and H are both selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist since there must be at least one scientist of each type.
  - If F is selected, then K cannot be selected. If K is not selected, then M must be selected to include at least one chemist. But if M is selected, then P and R must also be selected, and in that case, the panel includes zoologists as well.
  - If F is not selected, then K must be selected to include at least one chemist. But if K is selected, then M must not be selected, and in that case, the panel includes only one chemist. If M is not selected, then P and R may or may not be selected.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with certain conditions.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis: 
  From the given conditions, we can conclude that Parra and Tiao are both not working in Zone 3 because at least one of them works in Zone 1 or Zone 2. Udall can't be working in Zone 3 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey. Therefore, Tiao and Udall both can't work in Zone 3. Kim and Mahr cannot be working in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, the answer would be the list of sales representatives that doesn't include any of these names as working in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone 3.
  Parra or Tiao, works in Zone 1 but not in both. 
  Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2 but not in both.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone
  There are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To solve this problem, we need to find the sales representatives who work in Zone 3, given the conditions provided. We could start by identifying the sales representatives who can't work in Zone 3 due to the constraints provided:
- Parra and Tiao can't work in Zone 3 since one of them works in Zone 1 and there can only be 1 representative from each zone.
- Udall can't work in Zone 3 since Tiao or Udall, works in Zone 2 and there can only be 1 representative from each zone.
- Quinn can't work in Zone 3 since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone and Parra can't work in Zone 3.

Therefore, we are left with the following possibilities: 
- Kim, Mahr, Stuckey
- Kim, Tiao, Stuckey 
- Kim, Tiao, Udall
- Kim, Udall, Stuckey

Out of these, the only option that fulfills the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 is Answer("D") Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
We do not know who works in Zone 1 and who works in Zone 2. However, we do know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and we can eliminate any answer choice that does not have at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3.

A: Kim, Mahr (only two sales representatives listed)

B: Kim, Tiao (only two sales representatives listed)

C: Parra, Quinn (only two sales representatives listed)

D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall (three sales representatives)

E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall (four sales representatives)

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The company employs 7 sales representatives to work in 3 sales zones.
  - Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both.
  - Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - From the conditions, we know that it is possible that 4 sales representatives could be working in Zone 3.
  - From the first condition, we know that either Parra or Tiao is working in Zone 1.
  - From the second condition, we know that either Tiao or Udall is working in Zone 2. Therefore, the other sales representative works in Zone 3.
  - From the third and fourth condition, we know that if Parra is working in one zone, then Quinn and Stuckey must be working in the same zone as well, while Udall is working in the other zone. Therefore, at most 3 sales representatives could be working in Zone 3.
  - Therefore, the only possible answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  We know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, at least one of Parra, Tiao, or Udall must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2. We also know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than Zone 2, so there must be at least two sales representatives in Zone 3. From the last two conditions, we know that either Stuckey and Udall or Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3. Therefore, (D) "Stuckey, Tiao, Udall" and (E) "Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall" are the only possible options that could be a complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives working in total: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The sales representatives work in three different sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis: 
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so any complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 must include at least three sales representatives. We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, any list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 that includes Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, or Udall must include both of the representatives in their respective pairs. 

A: Kim and Mahr are not mentioned in any of the given conditions.
B: Kim is not mentioned in any of the given conditions. Tiao cannot work in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
C: Parra and Quinn could work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3 together, but there must be at least one more representative in Zone 3. Therefore, C is not a complete and accurate list.
D: Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2, so they cannot both work in Zone 3. Therefore, D is not a complete and accurate list.
E: This list includes Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall, which we know must be in the same sales zone as each other. To make the list complete, we need at least one more representative in Zone 3. Kim and Mahr are not mentioned in any of the given conditions, so they could work in Zone 3 with Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall. Therefore, E is a complete and accurate list.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The sales representatives are Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A: Kim and Mahr cannot both work in Zone 3 since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and there are only two sales representatives listed. Therefore, choice A is not possible.
  - Choice B: Tiao cannot work in Zone 3 since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and it is not specified that Parra works in Zone 1. Therefore, choice B is not possible.
  - Choice C: Parra and Quinn are working in the same sales zone. Since we are looking for a list of employees that work in Zone 3, and Parra is already assigned to Zone 1, Quinn cannot be placed in Zone 3. Therefore, choice C is not possible.
  - Choice D: Stuckey and Udall are working in the same sales zone. Also, either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, which means Tiao is assigned to Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao cannot be placed in Zone 3 with Stuckey and Udall. Therefore, choice D is not possible.
  - Choice E: Parra and Quinn are working in the same sales zone which could either be Zone 1 or Zone 3. Stuckey and Udall are working in the same sales zone, but which could either be Zone 2 or Zone 3. Therefore, all four employees can be working in Zone 3 as it has more sales representatives compared to Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 is unknown.
  The number of sales representatives working in Zone 2 is exactly one.
  More of the sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  D: Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so they cannot both be working in Zone 2.
  A, B, C: None of these choices includes more sales representatives than Zone 2.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  Four sales representatives working in Zone 3 is the minimum number that allows for more of the representatives to work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 
  Parra and Quinn must work in the same sales zone, which can only be Zone 3, leaving no less than two other people to work with them in Zone 3. 
  And since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, it must be Zone 3. 
  Therefore, the sales representatives working in Zone 3 must be Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The company employs seven sales representatives.
  The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Eliminating Choices:
  A: Kim and Mahr are only two sales representatives, so they cannot be more than the sales representatives working in Zone 2, which contradicts the given condition. Moreover, none of them can work in Zone 1 where either Parra or Tiao must work.
  B: Kim works neither in Zone 1 nor in Zone 2, which contradicts the given conditions. 
  C: Parra and Quinn cannot work in Zone 3 since there must be more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  D: This list satisfies all the given conditions. 
  E: This list has all sales representatives and cannot be only for Zone 3.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The total number of sales representatives is exactly 7. 
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Eliminating one option at a time:
  A: Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3 since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  B: Kim cannot work in Zone 3 since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  C: Parra and Quinn work in the same zone. It is not possible for them to work with Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, or Udall since they are already assigned to one of the other zones. Therefore, it is also not possible for them to work in Zone 3 together.
  D: This is a possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3. 
  E: Parra and Quinn work in the same zone. It is not possible for them to work with Kim, Mahr, or Tiao since they are already assigned to one of the other zones. Therefore, it is also not possible for them to work in Zone 3 together. It is also not possible for Stuckey and Udall to work in Zone 3 together since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, one batch on one day of the week.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
 
Let's consider the schedule for each of the cookies:
- Oatmeal: 1st batch on Monday, 2nd batch on Wednesday, 3rd batch on either Tuesday or Thursday.
- Peanut butter: 1st batch on Tuesday or Thursday (whichever day oatmeal's 3rd batch is not made), 2nd batch on Monday, 3rd batch on Wednesday.
- Sugar: 1st batch on Wednesday or Friday (whichever day oatmeal's 3rd batch is made), 2nd batch on Tuesday or Thursday (whichever day peanut butter's 1st batch is not made), 3rd batch on Thursday.

If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, it means that either:
- Oatmeal's 1st batch is made on Thursday, which implies that Sugar's 2nd batch is made on Thursday as well, and Peanut Butter's 3rd batch is made on Wednesday. In this case, the false statement would be (B) "At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday."
- Sugar's 3rd batch is made on Monday, which implies that Oatmeal's 1st batch is made on Monday as well, and Peanut Butter's 2nd batch is made on Wednesday. In this case, the false statement would be (C) "Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday."

Action: Answer("(B)")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday)
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Analysis:
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, there are only three possible cases:
  Case 1: Oatmeal 1 = Sugar 3
  Case 2: Peanut Butter 1 = Sugar 3
  Case 3: Sugar 1 = Oatmeal 3 or Sugar 1 = Peanut Butter 3
  Let's check each option based on the three cases:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - True for all cases.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - False for all cases. 
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - False for all cases.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - True for Case 1 and Case 3, False for Case 2.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - True for all cases.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies - oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made from start to finish on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we know that the first batch of cookies is not made on Thursday (since that's when the second batch of sugar cookies are made). We also know that the first batch of cookies is not made on Friday (since no two same batches are made on the same day). From this, we can conclude that the first batch of cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. If we look at the given conditions, we see that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Since there are three batches of each kind of cookie, the third batch of oatmeal cookies will be made on a different day than the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that the first batch of cookies must be the first batch of peanut butter cookies. With this information, we can determine which statement could be false.

A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True, since we know that three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week from Monday through Friday, and at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday)
B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (True, since there are only three batches of each kind of cookie, and we know that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, which means that there could be at least two batches of cookies made on Wednesday)
C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False, since we know that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday)
D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (Could be true, since the first batch of peanut butter cookies could be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies could be made on Monday)
E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (False, since we know that three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week from Monday through Friday)

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Approach: 
  We will go through each statement and check if it could be false or not given the constrains.

Action: Answer("B") 
Solution:
  Since "At least one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch" and "Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday)", we can infer that:
  oatmeal first batch is made on Monday/Tuesday,
  sugar's third batch is made on Thursday/Friday,
  peanut butter first batch is made on a day that is different from oatmeal's first batch.
  
  Statement A: If we distribute batches in such a way that 1 oatmeal batch is made on Monday/Tuesday, 1 sugar batch is made on Thursday/Friday, and rest of them are made on Wednesday, then we can have all batches made on different days. Therefore, statement A could be true.
  
  Statement B: There are only 3 remaining oatmeal batches and 2 of them must be made with the remaining peanut butter batches (from Monday/Tuesday). Since there must be different kinds of batches made on Wednesday, we need to have oatmeal's last batch made on Wednesday. Consequently, only 1 sugar batch is made on Thursday/Friday. Since we have already used up peanut butter and oatmeal's batches for Wednesday, we cannot make 2 sugar batches on Wednesday. Therefore, we cannot have at least two batches of cookies made on Wednesday. Statement B could be false.
  
  Statement C: At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. Since there are three batches of each type of cookie, and no three batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day, we must make one batch of each type of cookie on Monday. Therefore, Statement C must be true.
  
  Statement D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. Since we already used two peanut butter and oatmeal batches on Monday/Tuesday, we must use the remaining peanut butter and oatmeal batch on Wednesday. Therefore, we must make 2 sugar batches on Tuesday. Hence, Statement D could be true.
  
  Statement E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. Since we must use the remaining batches of oatmeal and sugar on Thursday/Friday, we cannot have peanut butter's one or two batches made on Friday. Therefore, we can only have one batch of cookies made on Friday. Therefore, Statement E could be true.
  
Therefore, the false statement could be B and the answer is Answer("B").
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday

If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, that means that:
  - If oatmeal first batch is made on the same day as sugar's third batch, then peanut butter's first batch must be made on Wednesday, sugar's second batch must be made on Monday, and oatmeal's second batch must be made on Friday.
  - If peanut butter first batch is made on the same day as sugar's third batch, then oatmeal's second batch must be made on Wednesday, sugar's second batch must be made on Monday, and oatmeal's first batch must be made on Friday.

Testing each option:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - This statement is true since there are three kinds of cookies and three batches of each kind, which must be made on each day from Monday to Friday.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - This statement is true since Wednesday is the only day where there are two cookies left to make, and both batches can be made on that day.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - This statement is false, since at least two batches of cookies must be made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - This statement is true, since only two kinds of cookies remain to be made on Tuesday, and they must each be made in one batch.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - This statement is true, since only one batch of each kind of cookie remains to be made on Friday.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - Each batch is made on a single day, Monday through Friday.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - Let's assume the first kind of cookie is oatmeal and the second kind of cookie is sugar. Thus, the third kind of cookie is peanut butter.
  - If oatmeal's first batch is made on the same day as sugar's third batch, it means that the third batch of sugar cookies is made before the first batch of oatmeal cookies.
  - The batches must be made in the following order: 
      Monday: At least one batch of cookies
      Tuesday: 1st batches of oatmeal, sugar, and peanut butter cookies
      Wednesday: 2nd batches of peanut butter and sugar cookies
      Thursday: 2nd batch of oatmeal cookies
      Friday: 3rd batches of oatmeal, sugar, and peanut butter cookies
      
Action: Answer("C")   
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
- Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Each kind has three batches.
- Each batch is made from start to finish on a single day.
- No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
- At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("B")
Reasoning: 
If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it is possible that:
- The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday.
- The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday.
- The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday.
Thus, it is possible that exactly one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days, which rules out choices A and E.
It is also possible that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, which rules out choice C.
It is possible that exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, which rules out choice D.
However, if the batches are made as described above, then it is not possible for at least two batches of cookies to be made on Wednesday, since that would require making at least two batches of the same kind of cookie on the same day, which is not allowed by the constraints of the problem. Therefore, choice B could be false.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, 
  then either the first kind is oatmeal or sugar cookies and the second kind is sugar or oatmeal cookies.
  From the given information, the only possible days for the first batch of oatmeal cookies to be baked are Tuesday or Wednesday.
  The only possible days for the third batch of sugar cookies to be baked are Tuesday or Friday.
  Thus, if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch,
  then either Tuesday or Friday is the day they are both made.

Solutions:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (Possible, because even if one of the batches is not mentioned, we know that at least one batch is made on Monday, which means there are batches on at least one other day of the week.)
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (Not possible, because we know that neither oatmeal nor peanut butter cookies are made on Wednesday.)
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (Not possible, because we know that three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.)
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (Not possible, because we know that either the first batch of oatmeal cookies and the third batch of sugar cookies would both be made on Tuesday, 
     or the first batch of sugar cookies and the third batch of oatmeal cookies would both be made on Tuesday, 
     either way, this means that a third batch of another kind of cookie would also be made on Tuesday.)
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (Possible, because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so there are only three batches left to be made on either Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday. If one of those batches is on Friday, then this statement would be true.)

Action: Answer("D") 
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The bakery makes three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, one batch per day from Monday through Friday.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then there are only two possible cases: oatmeal and sugar.
  - If oatmeal's first batch is made on the same day as sugar's third batch, then oatmeal's first batch is made on Wednesday and sugar's third batch is made on Friday.
  - Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday (since Wednesday is taken) and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on the same day (since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies).
  - Also, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday (since it is specified in the conditions).
  
Answer:
  - If oatmeal's first batch is made on Wednesday and sugar's third batch is made on Friday, then the only option that could be false is D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Answer("D").
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday)
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookies are made on the same day
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday
Actions:
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the second batch of the remaining kind of cookie must be made on Wednesday
  - Therefore, (B) can be false, since it states that at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, and this is not necessarily true based on the given information.
  - (A) is true because we know there are 3 batches for each kind of cookie, so there must be at least one batch made each day.
  - (C) is false because we know that there are at least two batches of each kind of cookie made, so exactly one batch cannot be made on Monday.
  - (D) is true because there are 3 batches of each kind of cookie and we know that no two same kind of cookie batches are made on the same day, which means there must be exactly 2 batches of cookies made on Tuesday.
  - (E) is true because we know there are 3 batches for each kind of cookie, so there must be exactly one batch made on Friday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
Choices:
  A: Quinn
  B: Ruiz
  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  In this task, we have seven workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  We need to determine which of the remaining workers must be a project member.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then only at most two out of Smith, Wells, and Taylor can be a project member. 
  Since we know that Wells cannot be a project member with Ruiz or Verma, and that Smith cannot be a project member without Taylor, and that only one project member is a leader, then we must have either Quinn or Ruiz as both project member and leader. 
  So, we have two cases:
  Case 1: If Quinn is the only eligible leader:
    Then Quinn and the two other project members must be chosen among the set {Smith, Wells, and Xue}. Neither Verma nor Ruiz can be chosen. 
    Since Taylor cannot be a project member if Quinn is the leader, then we must choose Wells and Smith. 
    Therefore, the worker who must be a project member is Xue.
  Case 2: If Ruiz is the only eligible leader:
    Then Ruiz and the two other project members must be chosen among the set {Smith and Wells}. 
    Neither Taylor, Verma, nor Xue can be chosen since either Taylor and Smith or Wells and Ruiz would have to be together in that case.
    Therefore, there is no worker who must be a project member in this case.
    
Conclusion:
  Therefore, the answer is A: Quinn if Quinn is the only eligible leader, or there is no answer if Ruiz is the only eligible leader. 
  Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project requires selecting three members, including a project leader. 
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

If Taylor is not a project member, then there can only be two project members. 
If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be, but since Taylor is not a project member, Smith cannot be one either. 
Therefore, Wells must be a project member because if Wells is not selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three workers as members.
  Exactly one of the three workers will be designated as the project leader.
  Quinn and Ruiz can be members of the project only if either one of them is the project leader.
  If Smith is a member of the project, Taylor must also be a member.
  If Wells is in the project, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be in it.
  
  If Taylor is not a project member, the project has only two members, and Smith is not one of them. This means that Wells cannot be in the project, because in that case neither Ruiz nor Verma can be in the project, and the project would have only one member. Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be in the project as its leader, and either Verma or Xue must be in the project as its third member.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. 
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. 
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. 
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

If Taylor is not a project member, Wells can't be a project member because if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Therefore Smith can't be a project member, because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. This means that at most one person can be selected from among the group of Quinn, Ruiz, and Verma (because if either Quinn or Ruiz is selected, they have to be the project leader, leaving only one spot). The remaining two project members must be selected from among the group of Smith, Wells, and Xue (since we know Taylor isn't on the project). 

Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Wells must be a project member.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, they must lead the project.
  If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, Ruiz and Verma cannot be selected.
  We need to determine which worker must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.

Solution:
  We cannot select Smith because if Smith is to be selected, Taylor must also be selected, which contradicts the given condition.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected if Wells is a project member, we cannot choose Wells because it limits our options.
  If Quinn is to be selected, Quinn must lead the project, which implies that he/she cannot be a regular member (since only 3 are to be selected). But this contradicts the question that asks for a regular member.
  Xue is the only remaining worker, who is neither limited nor a contradiction. Therefore, Xue must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The project will have exactly three members.
  One of the project members will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Method:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member. 
  This implies that Wells is also not a project member because neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is a member. 
  Hence, the project members can only be chosen from the group {Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Xue}. 
  However, either Quinn or Ruiz can be chosen only if leading the project.
  Therefore, the project leader must come from {Quinn, Ruiz}, and the other two workers must be chosen from {Verma, Xue}.
  Since we want to know which worker must be a project member, we can ignore Quinn and Ruiz. 
  Answer: Answer("C") Verma. 
  
Therefore, Verma must be a project member if Taylor is not.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The project leader can be either Quinn or Ruiz if either of them is chosen as a project member.
  Smith and Taylor can be project members together.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
  If Taylor is not a project member, there are two cases:
  Case 1: Smith is a project member.
  In this case, Taylor cannot be a project member, which means that the third chosen worker must be either Quinn or Ruiz, since they are the only ones who can lead the project if they are chosen as members.
  
  Case 2: Smith is not a project member.
  In this case, the third chosen worker cannot be Ruiz because if Ruiz is a project member, he must be the project leader. Also, the third chosen worker cannot be Verma because if Wells is a project member then Verma cannot be. Therefore, the third chosen worker must be Wells.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  If Quinn or Ruiz are project members, then one of them must be the leader.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be a member.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members.
  We need to find one worker who must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
  
Solution:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, we need to consider the other constraints to determine who must be a project member. 
  If Quinn or Ruiz are project members, then one of them must be the leader. However, if either of them is a member, they cannot be just a member, they have to be the leader. This means that if neither of them is a leader, then they cannot be a project member. 
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members.
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then either Xue or Wells must be a project member, but we cannot determine which one of them must be the project member.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The project will have three members, one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
We are looking for a worker who must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member. That means in this case Smith cannot be a project member since if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be one. Also, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is a project member. So if we select Wells, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected and thus it forces Quinn to be the second project member and leader of the project. Therefore, Quinn must be a project member if Taylor is not. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have 3 members: 1 leader and 2 members.
  Quinn or Ruiz must be leader if they are to be members.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must be a member too.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then we can infer that Smith is not a project member, because if Smith were chosen, Taylor would have to be chosen as well. Therefore, we have 6 workers left: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Verma, Wells, and Xue. 
  If Wells is chosen, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members. Thus, Wells cannot be the leader. Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be the leader. Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be selected as a project member.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Veqemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon
  C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy
  D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than, wellspring
  E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The slots are numbered 1 to 6 from earliest to latest, and each slot must be filled by one of the six bands.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

If Vegemite performs in slot three, then:
  - Slots one and two cannot be filled by Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, or Xpert because of the constraints.
  - Slots four, five, and six cannot be filled by Yardsign because it has to perform in one of the first three slots.
  - Therefore, Yardsign must be in slot three, and the only band that can perform in slot one is either Vegemite or Zircon. If Zircon had slot one, it would contradict the given constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. 
  - So Vegemite is in slot one and Zircon is in slot two.
  - Then, Wellspring has to perform in slot four, followed by Xpert in slot five, and Uneasy in slot six.

Using this logic, the following must be true:
  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. (False)
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. (True)
  C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy. (False)
  D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring. (False)
  E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy. (False)

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Vegemite performs in slot 3, then it must perform before Wellspring and Zircon.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot 3.
  
Analysis:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot 3, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots 1 or 2. Therefore, Xpert will perform in slots 4, 5, or 6 since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Additionally, Uneasy will perform in slots 4, 5, or 6 since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Lastly, Yardsign must perform in slots 1, 2, or 3 since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

Action: Answer("D") 
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The order of the slots must meet the following constraints:
      - Vegemite performs before Zircon
      - Wellspring and Zircon each perform before Xpert
      - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots (slots 4, 5, or 6)
      - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots (slots 1, 2, or 3)
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then the possible order of the bands in the slots is:
      - Slot 1: Yardsign (by the last constraint)
      - Slot 2: either Wellspring or Zircon (by the second constraint)
      - Slot 3: Vegemite (by the question)
      - Slot 4: either Wellspring or Zircon (by the second constraint)
      - Slot 5: either Uneasy or Xpert (by the third constraint)
      - Slot 6: either Uneasy or Xpert (by the third constraint)

Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, Yardsign has to perform in an earlier slot than Wellspring, which is choice D.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Vegemite is in slot three.
  
So, according to constraint (1), Zircon cannot be in slot three. Therefore, it must be in slot four, five, or six. According to constraint (2), Wellspring must be in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, it must be in slot two and Zircon in slot four or Wellspring in slot one and Zircon in slot five. The remaining slots must be filled by Uneasy, Xpert, and Yardsign. According to constraint (3), Uneasy must be in slot four, five, or six. According to constraint (4), Yardsign must be in slot one, two, or three. Therefore, there are two possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: Wellspring in slot 1, Vegemite in slot 3, Zircon in slot 5, Uneasy in slot 4, Xpert in slot 6, and Yardsign in slot 2.
This scenario satisfies the conditions and in this case, Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
 
Scenario 2: Wellspring in slot 2, Vegemite in slot 3, Zircon in slot 4, Uneasy in slot 5, Xpert in slot 6, and Yardsign in slot 1.
This scenario also satisfies the conditions and in this case, Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.

Therefore, the answer is either A or E. As per the given scenarios, we can see that in Scenario 1 Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy (A), and in Scenario 2, Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy (E). Hence, the answer is None of the Above (as both A and E are possible answers).
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  We know that there are six slots that will be filled by six bands.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. 
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, there are a few possible band-slot assignments that could satisfy the constraints.

  Possibility 1:
   Slot 1: Yardsign
   Slot 2: Wellspring
   Slot 3: Vegemite
   Slot 4: Zircon
   Slot 5: Xpert
   Slot 6: Uneasy
  
  Using this possibility, we can answer the question.

  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. (Incorrect. Uneasy is performing after Xpert, so it must be false.)
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. (Correct. Wellspring is performing before Zircon and Xpert, so it is true.)
  C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy. (Incorrect. Xpert is performing before Uneasy, so it must be false.)
  D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring. (Incorrect. Wellspring is performing before Yardsign, so it must be false.)
  E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy. (Incorrect. Uneasy is performing after Zircon, so it must be false.)
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then only slots one and two could be occupied by Yardsign or Wellspring.
  Zircon cannot perform before Vegemite, which leaves the last three slots available.
  Uneasy will perform in one of the last three slots.
  Wellspring and Zircon will each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, Xpert must perform in slot six, which is one of the last three slots, and Uneasy must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Xpert performs in the last slot, and Uneasy performs in slot four or five. Since Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert, Uneasy cannot perform in slot six, so Uneasy must perform in slot four, and Zircon must perform in slot five. Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot two, and Yardsign must perform in slot one. So, Xpert performs last, which is one of the last three slots.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—will fill the six slots numbered slot one through slot six.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  
Analysis:
  Since Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that Uneasy cannot perform in slot six, so it must perform in either slot four or slot five.
  Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, we know that Yardsign cannot perform after Uneasy, so Uneasy must perform in slot four and Yardsign must perform in slot three.
  Since Xpert performs in a later slot than Wellspring and Zircon, we know that Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two, but it is not possible to know in which order they will perform based on the given constraints.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Vegemite performs in slot 3, we can use this as a reference to establish the order of the other bands.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. This means that Vegemite, Wellspring, and Zircon can't be in the first three slots, and Uneasy must be in the last three slots.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. This means that Xpert can only be in slots five and six.
  
Analysis:
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then the order of the first three slots must be Yardsign, Uneasy, and Zircon or Wellspring. The order of the last three slots must be Xpert, Vegemite, and the remaining band (either Wellspring or Zircon).
  A: We don't know their positions and can't deduce this from this information.
  B: Wellspring and Zircon must perform in earlier slots than Xpert, so this is true.
  C: Xpert can only perform in one of the last two slots, so this is false.
  D: Yardsign will perform in one of the first three slots, so this is false.
  E: Zircon could perform before Uneasy, but we don't know this for sure. This can't be the correct answer.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered slot one through slot six
  - Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon will perform in just one slot each.
  - The order must meet the following constraints:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. 

If Vegemite performs in slot three, then we know that it is ahead of Zircon in slots three through six.
This means that Zircon can only be in slot six, and Wellspring must be in slot four or slot five, with Xpert in one of the first three slots.
Yardsign, therefore, must be in either slot one or slot two, with Uneasy in slot four, slot five, or slot six.

So, the answer is B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Peters was recruited fourth.
- Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White.
- Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
- The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.

Here, we know that Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao and Villas was recruited immediately before White, which means White > Villas > Rovero > Tao. Also, Quinn joined before Rovero, so Quinn > Rovero. We are asked to find an option that could be true based on these conditions.
Analysis:
- Option A: Quinn was recruited first. We know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, but we don't know if Quinn was the first recruit. So we can't say for sure if this is true.
- Option B: Rovero was recruited third. If Peters was recruited fourth and Rovero was recruited third, then we don't have any placements for Villas, White, and Stanton. So we can't say for sure if this is true.
- Option C: Stanton was recruited second. If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao would have to be recruited third, which violates the condition that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. So this cannot be true.
- Option D: Tao was recruited sixth. We know that Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao and Peters was recruited fourth, so Tao cannot be the sixth recruit. This cannot be true.
- Option E: Villas was recruited sixth. If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruits would be: Quinn > Rovero > Stanton > Peters > White > Villas > Tao. This order satisfies all the known conditions and is consistent with the given information. Therefore, this could be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. 
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White. 
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.

If Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, and White was recruited earlier than Rovero, then we can conclude that Tao was recruited last. This means:
- Peters was recruited fourth (recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao).
- The order of recruitment of Villas and White must be: Villas, then White.
- Quinn was recruited before Rovero, so the order of recruitment for both must be:
  - Quinn, Rovero,  __, __, __, __, Tao
  - neither Stanton nor Tao can be recruited in the third position because Stanton was not immediately before or after Tao.
  - So the possible orderings are:
    - Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Stanton, Peters, Tao
    - Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Peters, Stanton, Tao
    
Action: Answer("D")  - Tao was recruited sixth.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
Using the given information, we can create a timeline of the recruitment order, starting with Quinn (since we know that he was recruited earlier than Rovero):
Quinn - (Unknown) - Rovero - (Unknown) - (Unknown) - Tao - (Unknown)

We also know that Peters was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited immediately before White. This means that the timeline can be modified as follows:
Quinn - (Unknown) - Rovero - (Unknown) - Villas - White - (Unknown) - Peters - Tao

Finally, we are told that White was recruited earlier than Rovero and that Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao. This means that Tao must be the last to be recruited, and White must be recruited before Rovero. 

Option A: There is no way Quinn could have been recruited first since Peters was recruited fourth. Eliminate A.
Option B: Since White came before Rovero in the order of recruitment, and Peters was fourth, then there are only two possible positions for Rovero - second or sixth. Therefore, it is possible that Rovero was recruited third. Keep B.
Option C: Stanton could not have been recruited second as it would mean Tao was recruited last, which contradicts the earlier established order. Eliminate C.
Option D: Tao cannot be recruited sixth as according to the established order, he was among the last to be recruited. Eliminate D.
Option E: Villas cannot be recruited sixth as Peters was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited before Peters. Eliminate E.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The criminal recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before Tao or immediately after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Elimination:
  - A: It cannot be true since Peters was recruited fourth and Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - B: It could be true since there is no restriction on the position of Rovero.
  - C: It cannot be true since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  - D: It cannot be true since Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  - E: It cannot be true since Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth, which means he was not the first, second, or third to be recruited.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, which means Quinn was not the fifth, sixth, or seventh to be recruited.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White, which means Villas was recruited either as the second or fifth.
  4. Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order must be Villas, White, Rovero, Tao.
  
Analysis:
  Based on the given information, Quinn was not the first, second, or third to be recruited, so A cannot be true. Peters was recruited fourth, which means Rovero cannot be recruited third, therefore B is not true. Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao, Stanton cannot be the second to be recruited, making C false. From the order given above, Tao cannot be the sixth to be recruited, so D can not be true. Finally, Villas was recruited as the second, so E is not true.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Peters was recruited fourth.
  5. There are seven accomplices.

Using the given information, it can be determined that Tao was recruited last, Stanton was recruited either first, second, fifth, or sixth, Quinn was recruited either first or second, Rovero was recruited either second, third, fourth, or fifth, Villas was recruited either fourth or fifth, and White was recruited either fifth or sixth.

If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must be recruited last. This leaves only possible placements for Villas and White as fourth and fifth, in either order. 

Option A is not possible because Quinn must have been recruited after Peters, who was recruited fourth. 
Option B is possible. If Villas and White were recruited fourth and fifth, respectively, then Rovero could have been recruited third.
Option C is not possible because Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
Option D is not possible because Tao must have been recruited last. 
Option E is not possible because Villas must have been recruited either fourth or fifth.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1) Peters was recruited fourth.
  2) Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3) Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  4) Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5) The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  6) White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  7) Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.

Let's take each option and analyze it:
A) If Quinn were recruited first, then Peters would have to be recruited second and the rest of the order would be determined. But this would mean that Quinn was recruited before Rovero, which contradicts the information provided.
B) If Rovero were recruited third, then Quinn would have to be recruited first and Peters second. This would also mean that Villas was recruited last and White second-to-last. This order satisfies the given conditions, so this could be true.
C) If Stanton were recruited second, then Quinn would have to be recruited first and Peters second. After that, there are no ways to assign the remaining accomplices without violating one of the given conditions.
D) If Tao were recruited sixth, then we would have the order Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, and Stanton. This violates the condition that Tao was recruited after Rovero.
E) If Villas were recruited sixth, then we would have the order Quinn, Peters, ?, ?, Rovero, Villas, White. There is no way to assign Tao and Stanton to the empty positions without violating one of the given conditions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are a total of 8 individuals including the suspect
  - The accomplices were recruited one at a time
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  - Peters was recruited fourth
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White
  - We know nothing about where the other accomplices were recruited in the order.
 
From the given information we can establish the following facts:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters is not Tao, Rovero, Villas, White.
  2. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, Villas is not Tao or Rovero.
  3. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Therefore, Stanton is not Tao or Rovero.
  4. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.

Now, let's apply the given condition: White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
- Rovero cannot be #1 or #2 because he was recruited after White.
- If Rovero were #3, then White would be #2 and Peters would be #4. This would mean that Quinn and Stanton would have to be #1 and #5 but we know that Stanton wasn't recruited immediately before Tao. Therefore, Rovero is not #3.
- If Rovero were #4, then White would be #3 and Peters would be #5. This would mean that Quinn and Stanton would have to be #1 and #2 but we know that Stanton wasn't recruited immediately before Tao. Therefore, Rovero is not #4.
- If Rovero were #5, then White would be #4 and Peters would be #6. This would mean that Quinn and Stanton would have to be #1 and #2 but we know that Stanton wasn't recruited immediately before Tao. Therefore, Rovero is not #5.
- If Rovero were #6, then White would be #5 and Peters would be #7. This means that Quinn and Stanton would have to be #1 and #2 and since Stanton wasn't immediately before or after Tao, Tao would have to be #3 and Villas would have to be #4. Therefore, Tao could be recruited sixth.

Answer: Answer("D") Tao was recruited sixth.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The accomplices were recruited one at a time.
  6. White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  
Process of elimination:
- Peters was recruited fourth, so neither A nor B can be true.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White, so E cannot be true.
- It is unclear where Stanton was recruited, so C cannot be confirmed.
- According to the given conditions, Tao must have been recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth, and that Tao and Stanton are not immediate neighbors in the recruitment order.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately prior to White.

Analysis:
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, we know that White must have been recruited before Tao.
  
  Peters was recruited fourth, and we know that Quinn was recruited before Rovero, so Quinn cannot be the first or second to be recruited.
  
  If Villas was recruited immediately prior to White and White was not the first to be recruited, then Villas would have to be one of the last two people to be recruited. Therefore, Villas could only have been recruited as the fifth or sixth person.
  
  From this, we can determine that Tao is recruited either sixth or seventh.

  I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is not also on the bottom shelf.
  O is on a higher shelf than L, so if O is on the bottom shelf, then L must also be on the bottom shelf.
  F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf. 
  There must be more books on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  
Analysis:
  If we place only F and M on the bottom shelf, these two books cannot satisfy the condition that there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Eliminate A.
  If we place F, H, and M on the bottom shelf, then K cannot be placed on any of the shelves, because it is said that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, but there is no other shelf higher than the middle shelf. Eliminate B.
  If we place G, H, and K on the bottom shelf, then there are no shelves left for F, I, L, M, and O. Eliminate C.
  If we place F, G, M, and O on the bottom shelf, then I and K must be placed on the top shelf, but we still need to place H and L, which cannot be both placed on the middle shelf or both be placed on the top shelf. Eliminate D.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is E, which lists books that could all be on the bottom shelf and satisfy the given conditions. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are eight books that must be placed on three shelves.
- There are three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
- At least two books are placed on each shelf.
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
- Since there are eight books, and at least two books must be placed on each shelf, we know that there are at least two books on each shelf. Therefore, there are at least six books in total on the shelves.
- Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and there are at least two books on each shelf, we know that the bottom shelf has at least three books.
- We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
- We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the bottom shelf.
- We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the bottom shelf.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, M must be on the bottom shelf as well.
- Therefore, if F is on the bottom shelf, the list of books placed on the bottom shelf must include at least F and M, and at least one more book.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Using the given conditions, we can see that F and M must be placed on the same shelf. I is already placed on the middle shelf, so F and M cannot be on the middle shelf. The number of books on the bottom shelf is greater than the number of books on the top shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf.  

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  2. More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  3. I is placed on the middle shelf.
  4. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  5. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  6. F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Solutions:
  - From rule 3, I is on the middle shelf. Thus, the bottom shelf is the shelf with the most books and the top shelf has the least books.
  - From rule 2, each shelf has at least 2 books. So, the top shelf has 2 books and the middle shelf has at least 2 books.
  - From rule 6, F and M are on the same shelf. Also, K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - From rule 5, O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - Therefore, F and M can only be placed together on either the top or middle shelf. But, K is placed on a higher shelf than F so, F and M must be placed on the middle shelf. Hence, I is also on the middle shelf.
  - From there, O and L must be located on the bottom shelf according to rule 5.
  - That leaves H and G for the top shelf and K for the middle shelf.

A: F, M --> F and M are both on the middle shelf. Incorrect. 
B: F, H, M --> H is not on the top shelf. Incorrect.
C: G, H, K --> K is not on the middle shelf. Incorrect.
D: F, G, M, O --> G and O are not on the same shelf. Incorrect.
E: G, H, L, M --> Correct. G and H are on the top shelf, M and L are on the bottom shelf, I is on the middle shelf and K and O are on the same shelf. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least two books.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F and M are on the same shelf.

Analysis:
  - Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  - I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F, so F cannot be on the top shelf.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L, so they cannot be on the same shelf.
  - Since F and M are on the same shelf, they cannot be on the top or middle shelf.

Solution:
  From the analysis, we know that F and M are on the bottom shelf. Since the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books, H must also be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, the answer is (B) F, H, M. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: F and M are both located on the same shelf, but there must be at least two books on each shelf, so this option is incorrect.
  B: H is located on the same shelf as F and M, but there must be at least two books on each shelf, so this option is incorrect.
  C: G and K cannot be located on the bottom shelf because K must be located on a higher shelf than F. This option is incorrect.
  D: F, G, and M can be located on the bottom shelf, while O is on a higher shelf and satisfies the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. However, we do not know where H, I and L are located, so we cannot be certain that this option is true. 
  E: G, H, L, and M cannot all be located on the bottom shelf because there must be at least two books on each of the other shelves. This option is incorrect.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
- I is on the middle shelf
- K is on a higher shelf than F
- O is on a higher shelf than L
- F is on the same shelf as M

Analysis:
- Based on the conditions given, the number of books on the bottom shelf must be greater than the number of books on the top shelf. Since there are 8 books in total and at least 2 books on each shelf, the only possible distribution of books on the shelves is 2-2-4 (top-middle-bottom) or 2-3-3.
- We know that I is on the middle shelf, so it rules out the possibility of 2-2-4 distribution. Therefore, the distribution must be 2-3-3, which means exactly 3 books are on the bottom shelf.
- F and M are on the same shelf, and there are three shelves, so they are likely both on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("A") - F, M.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  Choices A, B, and E are not valid because they have less than three books on the bottom shelf.
  Choice C is not valid because it does not include any of the books which are placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are exactly three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Exactly eight books are placed on the bookcase.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is on a higher shelf than F.
  O is on a higher shelf than L.
  F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  - Choices A and B are not possible because according to the rules, there should be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and each of these choices only has one book on the bottom shelf.
  - Choice C is not possible because it does not have more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - Choice D is not possible because it has four books listed and there can only be at most three books per shelf.
  - Choice E might be possible because it has four books and more books could be placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are exactly three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  More books are placed on the bottom than the top shelf
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F and M are on the same shelf.
  
Analyzing the answer choices:
  A: If F and M are on the bottom shelf, then only two books are placed on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that each shelf has at least two books. Thus, this option is not possible.
  B: F and M are on the same shelf, then for there to be at least two books on each shelf, H must also be on the same shelf with F and M. Thus, this option is possible.
  C: None of these books are mentioned to be placed on the bottom shelf. Thus, this option is not possible.
  D: F, M, and O cannot be on the same shelf. Thus, this option is not possible. 
  E: None of these books are mentioned to be placed on the bottom shelf. Thus, this option is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring, does not affect the publication of N
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall, does not affect the publication of M
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall, does not affect the publication of N
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring, is equivalent to the given condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring, does not affect the publication of M
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  - K and N must be published in the same season.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks. If M can only be published in the spring, then it means that P cannot be published in the spring since M and P cannot be published in the same season. Hence, if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year, with each cookbook being published in one of two seasons—fall or spring. 
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. 
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other. 
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D") 
Substituting condition D for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks because both conditions are saying that if N is published in the spring, M has to be published in the spring as well.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  - K and N must be published in the same season.
  - If K is published in fall, O must also be published in fall.
  - If M is published in fall, N must be published in spring.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: None of the conditions in the other answer choices have the same effect as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. However, if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring, which has the same effect. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Action: Answer("D") 

If N is published in the spring, we know from (2) that K must also be published in the spring. From the contrapositive of (3), we know that if O is not published in the fall, then K cannot be published in the fall. Therefore, O must be published in the fall. Finally, from (4), if N is published in the spring, then M must be published in the spring as well. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  This is a logic problem that involves six cookbooks being published in either fall or spring. There are certain conditions that must be met in terms of which books can be published in the same season and which can't. The question asks what condition could be substituted for the current condition without changing the schedule.
  
  A: This condition connects M to L, and does not affect N.
  B: This condition connects N to P, and does not affect M.
  C: This condition connects M to P, and does not affect N.
  D: This condition connects N to M, which is the current condition.
  E: This condition connects 0 to N, and does not affect M.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The original rule states: "If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring." This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season. 
  A: The rule proposed by choice A does not have the same effect. It simply states that if L is published in the fall, then M must be published in the spring.
  B: The rule proposed by choice B does not have the same effect. It simply states that if N is published in the fall, then P must also be published in the fall.
  C: The rule proposed by choice C does not have the same effect. It simply states that if M is published in the spring, then P must be published in the fall.
  D: The rule proposed by choice D has the same effect as the original rule. If N is published in the spring, then M cannot be published in the spring. 
  E: The rule proposed by choice E does not have the same effect. It simply states that if O is published in the spring, then N must also be published in the spring. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring, does not affect the scheduling of N.
  B: This condition is not relevant to the original condition.
  C: This condition is not equivalent to the original condition.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring, is the contrapositive of the original statement. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement is also true.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring, does not affect the scheduling of M.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 cookbooks: K, L, M, N, O, and P
  - Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons: fall or spring
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Action: 
  To have the same effect as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, we need to find another condition that forces M and N to be published in different seasons. 
  Choice C says if M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This condition is not related to N, so it doesn't help us achieve our objective. 
  Choice D says if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This is the opposite of what we want, so it doesn't help us either. 
  Choice E says if O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This doesn't help us either because we don't know the relationship between O and M. 
  Choice A says if L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This will achieve the same effect because it separates M and N. 
  Choice B says if N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This condition is not related to M, so it doesn't help us achieve our objective. 
  Therefore, the answer is A. Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")  
If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks as the original condition.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The four students are Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student is displaying two paintings-one oil and one watercolor.
  Two paintings are displayed on each of the walls 1, 2, 3, and 4-one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.

Subsequently,
  Hidalgo's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1 because no wall can have only one student's work on it.
  Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1 because Franz can't have work displayed on the same wall as Isaacs.
  Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1 because it has to be displayed on the same wall as Franz's.
  Therefore, the only option left is that Greene's watercolor must be the painting displayed on Wall 1.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The exhibition room has four walls, and each has exactly two paintings, one on the upper position and one in the lower position.
  Each of the four students displays exactly two paintings in the exhibition--an oil and a watercolor.
  At least one oil painting will be displayed on each wall.
  If a student displays an oil painting on a wall, then another student must display a watercolor painting on that same wall.
  Wall 1 and 4 have exactly one painting from each of two students displayed on each wall.

Since Isaacs's oil is displayed on the lower position of wall 4, his watercolor painting cannot be on the same wall since no wall can have only watercolors. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be on either wall 1, 2, or 3. 

If Franz's oil is on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor painting must be on wall 3, since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Moreover, since no wall can have only watercolors, Hidalgo's oil should be on wall 2, and Hidalgo's watercolor should be on wall 1. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Franz's watercolor. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are 4 walls in the exhibition room, and each wall has two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  Each of the four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) has exactly one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then the following are true:
    1. The oil painting of Isaacs is not on the wall 2.
    2. The oil painting of Isaacs is not on the wall 3.
    3. The watercolor painting of Franz is not on the wall 2.
    4. The watercolor painting of Franz is not on the wall 4.
    5. The watercolor painting of Greene is on the wall 3.
    6. The oil painting of Franz is not on the wall 4.
    7. The wall 1 has no wall that has only watercolors displayed on it, and no wall that has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are four art students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each display exactly 2 paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly 2 paintings will be displayed on each wall, with one painting in the upper position and one painting in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  
Solution: 
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then neither Isaacs's oil nor Greene's oil can be displayed on wall 2. Thus, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 2. 
  If Franz's oil is on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor is on wall 3. And if Greene's watercolor is on wall 3, then Franz's oil must be on wall 1, in the upper position. Thus, Greene's oil must be on wall 1 in the lower position.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  We have 4 students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  We have a total of 8 paintings (2 from each student).
  Each wall will have exactly 2 paintings (one oil, one watercolor) and exactly 2 walls will display each student's paintings.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Wall 2 already has Isaacs's watercolor, so it cannot have any paintings from Isaacs anymore.
  Wall 3 has Franz's oil, which means it cannot have any of Franz's watercolors.
  Wall 1 must have one oil and one watercolor, since no wall can have only watercolors on it.
  Wall 1 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.

Analysis:
  Since Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 1, it cannot be either in wall 3 or wall 4, which means it must be on wall 2 or wall 1. Since Isaacs's watercolor is already on wall 2, it must be that Franz's watercolor is displayed on wall 1. Wall 1 cannot have Isaacs's oil since it cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs. This leaves us with only one possibility: Greene's oil as the painting displayed on wall 1.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are 4 students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, Isaacs.
  2. Each student will display exactly 2 paintings - an oil and a watercolor.
  3. Each wall will have exactly 2 paintings - one oil and one watercolor in upper and lower positions.
  4. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  5. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  6. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  7. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  8. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
We are given that:
  - Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  - Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.

If Greene's oil painting was on the same wall as Franz's oil painting, then the second painting on that wall would be a watercolor, which cannot be by Greene, Isaacs, or Franz. So, it is not possible to have Greene's oil painting on wall 3. According to the condition 6, we cannot have paintings by Isaacs and Franz on the same wall. Therefore, Isaacs's oil painting cannot be on wall 3.

So, Greene's oil is not on wall 3 and Isaacs's oil is not on wall 3. Therefore, the oil painting on wall 3 can be by only one student i.e. Hidalgo. According to the condition 5, no wall can have only one student’s painting. Therefore, a watercolor painting by Hidalgo must be displayed on wall 3.

Since Hidalgo's oil painting is not on wall 2 and Isaacs's oil painting is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Hidalgo's oil painting must be in the upper position of wall 1 or 3. But we know that Hidalgo only has one oil painting and it is already on wall 3. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil painting must be in the lower position of wall 1. This means, Hidalgo's watercolor painting must be in the upper position of wall 1. 

Thus, the only painting left for wall 1 is Greene's watercolor painting. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  There are four walls: 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  Each student displays exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings are displayed on each wall, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, one of the paintings by Hidalgo must be on wall 1.
  
Analysis:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 4. Therefore, none of Isaacs's paintings can be on wall 1. Since Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 1 and Isaacs's paintings cannot be on wall 1. Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then neither of Greene's paintings can be on wall 3, which means that one of Greene's paintings must be on wall 1.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  We know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  We know that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  We know that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed and Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 4. If Greene's oil is displayed on wall 1, then Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 2 and wall 4 respectively. If Greene's oil is displayed on wall 4, then Hidalgo's watercolor and oil must be displayed on wall 1 and wall 2 respectively.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Four art students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each display exactly two paintings - an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. 
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  According to the given conditions, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be on wall 3 as well. Therefore, Greene's oil must be the only painting left that can be displayed on wall 1 because no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
Four art students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs - will display two paintings each, one oil and one watercolor.
Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls in the exhibition room, with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
The following conditions apply:
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, it follows that Greene's oil is displayed on Wall 1. 

Reasoning: 
According to the given conditions, no wall has only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, wall 2 has Franz's watercolor displayed on it. Since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2. Thus, Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, one of Hidalgo's painting must be displayed on wall 2, and it must be the watercolor since the wall already has Isaacs's watercolor. Wall 3 has Franz's oil displayed and no wall can have the work of only one student displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1 as it is the only painting left that is not already assigned to a wall.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  2. The reports will be given over three consecutive days--Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day both Helen and Irving must give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
 
  George is presenting on Tuesday, so there is only one possibility for him to give a presentation.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give presentations, then Helen and Irving must both give presentations on the next day, unless Nina's presentation is on Wednesday. If Nina's presentation is on Wednesday, then only one of Helen or Irving must present on Wednesday. Also, neither Olivia nor Robert can present in the afternoon.
  
Option A is not possible because Helen must give a presentation on Tuesday or Wednesday, along with Irving, and hence, she cannot present on Wednesday alone. 
Option B is not possible since Nina cannot give a report on Monday. 
Option C is possible because both George and Nina can present on Tuesday, leaving Robert to present on either Monday or Wednesday. Also, on the next day i.e. Wednesday or Monday, Irving and Helen must give presentations, whether it is Nina or Robert who presents on Wednesday. 
Option D is not possible because neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon presentation. 
Option E is not possible because Robert cannot present in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - We have 8 students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert
  - Exactly 6 students will give reports, 2 reports per day
  - Tuesday is the only day George can give a report
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports
  - If Nina gives a report, on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days, we can eliminate choices that include more than two of them on the same day. 
  A: It is possible for Helen to give a report on Wednesday since no restriction is preventing her from giving a report on that day.
  B: We know that George cannot give his report on Monday or Wednesday because he can only give it on Tuesday. This means that Nina's report cannot be on Monday since it would violate the condition that they give reports on different days.
  C: If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina's report cannot be on Tuesday since it would force Helen and Irving to give reports on Wednesday which is not possible since exactly two reports are given each day.
  D: Olivia cannot give an afternoon report and since both George and Robert have already been assigned to reports, only morning slots are available for reports. This means Olivia cannot give a report on Monday.
  E: Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give his report in the morning. Since George cannot give his report on Monday or Wednesday, Robert cannot give his report on Tuesday. Therefore, Robert must give his report on Wednesday.
  
  The only option that is possible is A, which states that Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are eight students in a seminar, and exactly six of them will give reports over three consecutive days.
  Exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("C")  
If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then George must give his report on Tuesday, and neither Nina nor Robert can give their reports on Tuesday since each day has exactly two reports (one in the morning and one in the afternoon), and George is taking one of the spots on Tuesday, so Nina and Robert have to take the spots on Monday or Wednesday. If Nina gives her report, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday since Nina's report was given on Monday, so option A is false. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Robert must give a report on Wednesday, and Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday since Nina's report was given on Monday, so option B is false. However, if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then either Robert or Nina can give a report on Monday and the other student can give a report on Wednesday. Also, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday since Nina's report was given on Tuesday, so option C could be true. Olivia cannot give a report on Monday since she cannot give an afternoon report, so option D is false. Finally, Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday since he cannot give an afternoon report, so option E is false.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. George can give a report only on Tuesday.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

If George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, neither Helen nor Irving can give the reports on the next day, because they cannot give a report in the same day. Therefore, if Nina gives a report, that report cannot be on Monday because Helen and Irving cannot give the reports on Tuesday, so this means Nina must give a report on Wednesday, and thus Helen and Irving must both give the reports on Monday. This leaves George to give a report on Tuesday, and Robert must give a report on Monday, leaving Olivia to give a report on Tuesday. So we can see that possible options are that Helen gives a report on Wednesday, Nina gives a report on Tuesday, and Robert gives a report on Wednesday. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly 6 students give oral reports.
  2. Reports are given on 3 consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
  3. Exactly 2 reports are given per day (one in the morning, one in the afternoon).
  4. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  5. Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  6. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then the remaining three students who give reports are Helen, Irving, and Kyle. 
  Also, from condition 5, we know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so one of them has to give a report in the morning session. 
  Therefore, only choices B and E are possible because they are the only ones that leave a morning session available for either Robert or Olivia to give a report as required. 
  However, choice E cannot be true because Robert cannot give an afternoon report, leaving Wednesday afternoon with no available presenter.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- George can only give his report on Tuesday
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon
- Exactly six of eight students will give oral reports during three consecutive days

Action: Answer("C")

If George gives a report on Tuesday, that leaves only Monday and Wednesday for Nina and Robert to give their reports. Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so Nina and Robert must give their reports in the morning sessions. According to the condition, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports. However, if Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then there is no requirement for Helen and Irving to give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina could give her report on Tuesday or Wednesday, which means choice C, "Nina gives a report on Tuesday," could be true.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. exactly six students give individual oral reports, and exactly two reports are given each day according to specific conditions.
  2. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  3. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Solution:
- There are three students (George, Nina, and Robert) who give reports on different days.
- Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, then Nina and Robert cannot give a report on Tuesday.
- From condition 4, if Nina gives a report, then Irving and Helen must give reports on the next day unless Nina's report is on Wednesday. Thus Nina's report cannot be on Tuesday since it will force Helen and Irving to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina's report must be on Monday or Wednesday.
- If Nina's report is on Monday, then Robert's report must be on Wednesday because Robert cannot give an afternoon report. Hence, George's report is on Tuesday and thus, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday according to Condition 4. But this contradicts the condition that all three students (George, Nina, and Robert) must give reports on different days. Therefore, Nina's report must be on Wednesday.
- Since Robert cannot give an afternoon report, his report must be in the morning. Thus, George's report must be in the afternoon of Wednesday and Nina's report must be in the morning of Wednesday.
- Now, the only students left to give reports are Helen, Irving, and Olivia. Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, then Robert already gave a report in the morning. Therefore, it must be that Helen and Irving give reports on Wednesday in the morning and afternoon, respectively.
- Thus, the only choice that is possible is A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  - Since George, Nina, and Robert are giving reports, they cannot all give them on the same day.
  - Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, Nina and Robert must give their reports on either Monday or Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give a report on Tuesday, but George cannot give a report on Tuesday.
  - Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  - If Robert gives a report on Monday, then George must give a report on Wednesday, but Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  - Thus, Robert must give a report on Wednesday, and George must give a report on Monday.
  - This means that Helen must give a report on Tuesday, and Irving must also give a report on Tuesday.
  - Therefore, the only possible option is A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are 8 students in the seminar: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Exactly six students will give reports during three consecutive days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving give reports on the next day unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
  
  In order for George, Nina, and Robert to give reports on different days, the following conditions must be true:
  1. George gives report only on Tuesday
  2. Nina is giving report
  3. Robert is giving report
  4. Olivia is not giving an afternoon report
  5. Nina is not giving the report on Wednesday
  
  A: There cannot be any afternoon reports by Robert or Olivia who cannot give afternoon reports.
  B: Nina cannot give a report on Monday since both the reports on Monday have to be given in the morning and we need to have an afternoon report by Robert and Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
  C: If Nina is giving a report on Tuesday, then George will also need to give a report on Tuesday since Tuesday is the only day George can give a report. In this case, there will be no report left for Wednesday.
  D: Olivia cannot give a report in the afternoon and there are already two morning reports on Monday.
  E: If Robert is giving the report on Wednesday, then both of the two reports on Tuesday will have to be given in the afternoon which is not possible since neither Robert nor Olivia can give afternoon reports.
  
  Therefore, none of the above choices can be true.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- George gives a report only on Tuesday.
- Robert does not give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Action: 
- If George, Nina, and Robert give reports in different days, then we know that the reports will be given on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday because each day must have exactly two reports.
- From the given information, we know that George gives a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, Robert must give a morning report.
- If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day unless Nina's report is on Wednesday, which means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
- Therefore, the possible schedules for the reports are:
  - Monday: Nina (morning), Helen (afternoon); Robert (morning), George (afternoon)
  - Tuesday: George (morning), Kyle (afternoon); Helen (morning), Irving (afternoon); Nina (morning), Olivia (afternoon)
  - Wednesday: Kyle (morning), Olivia (afternoon); Irving (morning), Robert (afternoon)
- From the above schedules, we can see that only option B is possible, which is Nina gives a report on Monday. Therefore, Action: Answer("B").

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

A) If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, we still have four workers to choose from (Ruiz, Taylor, Verma, and Xue) to fill in three spots, and there is no information about who will be the leader, so this does not determine the selection completely.
B) If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, we still have four workers to choose from (Ruiz, Smith, Verma, and Xue) to fill in three spots, and there is no information about who will be the leader, so this does not determine the selection completely.
C) If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we still have four workers to choose from (Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, and Verma) to fill in three spots, and there is no information about who will be the leader, so this does not determine the selection completely.
D) If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Quinn and Smith must be chosen since they are the only remaining candidates who can lead the project. This leaves only one project member spot to fill, and Taylor, Verma, and Xue are the only options. Since Wells is not selected, the constraint about Ruiz and Verma is not violated. Therefore, this determines the selection completely.
E) If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Wells must be chosen to fill in three spots, which violates the constraint about Wells and Ruiz. Therefore, this is not possible and does not determine the selection completely.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are seven workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected.
  Exactly one of the project members will be the project leader.
  The selection is subject to the following constraints:
    Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
    Smith and Taylor must be selected together.
    Wells is selected means neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.

Action: Answer("E") 
If Ruiz is not selected then Quinn cannot be a project member. Then, the leader must be either Smith or Taylor. If Smith is selected, Taylor and the remaining person will complete the team. If Smith is not selected but Taylor is, then the team members are Taylor, Ruiz, and any other member except Quinn. If both Smith and Taylor are not selected, then the team members can be any three members except Quinn and Smith. If Verma is not selected, this leaves only three workers who could become leader, of which one will become leader.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The project will consist of 3 members.
  There is only one team leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be members if chosen as the leader.
  If Smith is a member, then Taylor must also be a member.
  If Wells is a member, then Ruiz and Verma cannot be members.
  
Analysis:
  To make sure the selection is completely determined, we need to find a scenario that leaves us with one option for leader and 2 options for project members. 
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith are selected, then we are left with only 5 candidates. No project leader constraint is met, so we can form a group with a leader and two members without violating any of the conditions.
  B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor are selected, then we are left with only 5 candidates. No project leader constraint is met, so we can form a group with a leader and two members without violating any of the conditions.
  C: If neither Quinn nor Xue are selected, we still have more than 3 candidates. No project leader constraint is met, so there are multiple possibilities without violating any of the conditions.
  D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells are selected, then either Quinn or Taylor can be the project leader, and the other will be selected as a member. The third member will be Xue or Verma, as Ruiz and Wells cannot be members in this scenario.
  E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma are selected, then either Quinn or Ruiz will be the project leader, and the other will be selected as a member. The third member will be Taylor or Xue, as Wells cannot be a member in this scenario.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three workers will be selected, and one will be the leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be selected if leading.
  If Smith is selected, Taylor must be selected
  If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.

Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, this means only one of them can be the leader since Quinn and Ruiz can only be a member if they are the leader. 
  This means that either Quinn or Ruiz will be the leader along with two other team members who are not Ruiz and Wells. 
  The constraints regarding Smith, Taylor, and Verma will still be met even if Quinn or Ruiz is the leader, so the selection will be completely determined.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The selection for the project is subject to several constraints as follows:
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. This does not guarantee the selection for the project is completely determined, as any other combination of three workers could be selected that meets the constraints.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected. This does not guarantee the selection for the project is completely determined, as any other combination of three workers could be selected that meets the constraints.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected. This does not guarantee the selection for the project is completely determined, as any other combination of three workers could be selected that meets the constraints.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected. If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, and since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, then the only person who can lead the project is Smith. Since Taylor must also be a project member if Smith is, then the project members are Smith, Taylor and Xue. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected. This does not guarantee the selection for the project is completely determined, as any other combination of three workers could be selected that meets the constraints.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  - If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then it is still possible to form a project with two members from the four options: Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue. Also, it is not specified who the leader is, so there are potentially three different projects that can be formed. Thus, this choice does not completely determine the selection.
  - If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then it is still possible to form a project with two members from the five options: Ruiz, Smith, Verma, Wells, and Xue. However, we know that Smith must be selected if Taylor is selected, so this choice does not completely determine the selection.
  - If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then it is still possible to form a project with two members from the five options: Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Wells. Also, it is not specified who the leader is, so there are potentially three different projects that can be formed. Thus, this choice does not completely determine the selection.
  - If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then it is still possible to form a project with two members from the five options: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue. Also, it is not specified who the leader is, so there are potentially three different projects that can be formed. Thus, this choice does not completely determine the selection.
  - If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then there are only three workers left to choose from: Quinn, Smith, and Taylor. From these, Smith and Taylor must be selected, so there is only one possible combination of workers: Smith, Taylor, and Quinn. Also, we know that Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Since Quinn is the only remaining worker who can lead the project, Quinn must be the leader. Thus, this choice completely determines the selection.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The project will have three members, one of which will be the leader. There are constraints that will govern the selection as follows:
- Quinn or Ruiz can only be included in the project if they lead the project.
- If Smith is included, then Taylor must also be included.
- If Wells is included, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be included.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the seven workers will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of the project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Analysis:
  We can start by looking at the given statements and observing which ones are dependent on others. For instance, being a project member is not dependent on leading the project, but the other way around it is. Similarly, if Wells is a project member, then Ruiz and Verma definitely cannot be. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. These observations can help us eliminate some of the options to determine the selection completely.

A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. (This does not provide any information as to whether the project leader is selected or not. Thus, we cannot determine the selection completely from this statement.)

B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected. (This statement implies that Smith cannot be a project member, which in turn means no other worker can be a project member either, as exactly three members must be selected. So the selection can be determined completely from this statement.)

C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected. (This does not provide any information as to whether the project leader is selected or not. Thus, we cannot determine the selection completely from this statement.)

D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected. (This statement implies that if Quinn is selected, Quinn must be the project leader. However, we cannot determine the selection completely from this statement.)

E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected. (This statement implies that if Wells is selected, Verma cannot be a project member. However, we cannot determine the selection completely from this statement.)

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Three people are to be selected for the project, and one of them is to be the leader.
  Constraints exist for who can be selected based on who else is selected.
 
A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. This means that Wells, Ruiz, and Verma cannot be selected either, since they cannot be selected together without Taylor. This leaves only Xue as a possibility for being selected, but it is not clear whether Xue can be the project leader since the prompt does not mention Xue in any constraints regarding the project leader.
B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected. This means that Wells, Ruiz, and Verma cannot be selected either, since they cannot be selected together without Taylor. This leaves only Xue as a possibility for being selected, but it is not clear whether Xue can be the project leader since the prompt does not mention Xue in any constraints regarding the project leader.
C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are still 4 people who can be selected: Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, and Wells. There are no constraints that prevent these 4 people from being selected together, so the selection is not completely determined.
D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Verma cannot be selected, but Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue are still possibilities to be selected. There are no constraints that prevent these 4 people from being selected together, so the selection is not completely determined.
E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells cannot be selected, but Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue are still possibilities to be selected. There are no constraints that prevent these 4 people from being selected together, so the selection is not completely determined.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Three workers will be selected for a special project, and one of these workers will be the project leader.
  - Constraints:
    - Quinn or Ruiz can only be project members if leading the project.
    - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
    - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
    
Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation: 
If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the following must be true:
- Neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be project leader, so the project leader must be one of the other five workers. 
- Wells can be a project member only if Quinn or Smith is selected, but since neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, Wells cannot be a project member. 
- Therefore, of the remaining four workers, exactly three must be selected to be project members. 
- Neither Ruiz nor Wells can be selected, so the three project members must be a subset of Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue. 
- Since the project leader cannot be Quinn or Ruiz, the project leader must be one of the three selected project members. 
- Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined. 

None of the other options allow us to uniquely determine the selection of project members and leader, because they leave open several possibilities for who could be selected or not.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also be in that same zone because of condition 4. This means that Tiao cannot be in that zone as well because of condition 2. Therefore, either Parra or Quinn must be in that zone. Since Parra can only be in Zone 1 or Zone 3, and Tiao cannot be in Zone 1, we can conclude that Quinn must be in the same zone as Mahr and Stuckey. Therefore Quinn cannot be in Zone 1.

If there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Zone 2 can have at most two representatives. Since Tiao and Udall cannot both be in Zone 2, we know that at most one of them is in Zone 2. Therefore one of them must be in Zone 1, and the other must be in Zone 3.

Based on the above analysis:
  A: Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because Tiao or Udall is in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr can work in Zone 1 because one of Tiao or Udall must be in Zone 1, and Parra cannot be in Zone 2.
  C: Parra can work in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  D: Stuckey can work in Zone 2 because this is the same zone as Mahr, and there can be at most two representatives in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because Udall is in the same zone as Mahr and Stuckey.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The sales representatives that work in different zones must be different people.
- There are only three sales zones, so each zone must have at least one sales representative and at most four sales representatives.
- Parra or Tiao work in Zone 1, but both cannot work there.
- Tiao or Udall work in Zone 2, but both cannot work there.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

We need to determine which statement could be true if Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone.

If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone, then Udall cannot work in that zone because Udall and Stuckey work in the same zone. Also, Quinn and Parra must work in that same zone because they are always in the same zone. Therefore, there are at most 4 sales representatives left to fill either Zone 1 or Zone 2 and fill Zone 3.

If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work there, and the only other representative who could join Tiao in Zone 1 would be Kim. That would mean that Mahr and Stuckey would have to work in Zone 3 together with Quinn and Udall. This is possible because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall cannot work there, and the only other representative who could join Tiao in Zone 2 would be Kim. That would mean that Mahr and Stuckey would have to work in Zone 3 together with Quinn, Parra, and Udall. This is possible because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Therefore, either A or E could be true because if Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone then there are multiple configurations that could make either statement true. 

Action: Answer("A or E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We are given a set of conditions about the seven sales representatives and the three sales zones.
  The conditions are:
    1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
    2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
    3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
    4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
    5. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We need to determine which of the options could be true if Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
  
Analysis:
  For Mahr and Stuckey to work in the same sales zone, it means they cannot be in Zones 1 and 2 (because the conditions for those zones do not allow them to work in the same zone). Therefore, if Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, they must be in Zone 3.
  
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. This is possible since we know that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Mahr and Stuckey are in Zone 3. However, we do not have any information connecting Kim to any particular sales zone, so this option is also possible even if Mahr and Stuckey are not in the same sales zone.
  
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1. This is not possible since we know from the conditions that Mahr and Stuckey are in the same sales zone and they cannot be in Zone 1.
  
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. This is possible since we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and we have already determined that Mahr and Stuckey are in Zone 3. However, we do not have any information connecting Parra to any particular sales zone, so this option is also possible even if Mahr and Stuckey are not in the same sales zone.
  
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. This is not possible since we have already determined that Mahr and Stuckey must be in Zone 3.
  
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1. This is possible since we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and we have already determined that Mahr and Stuckey are in Zone 3. However, we do not have any information connecting Tiao to any particular sales zone, so this option is also possible even if Mahr and Stuckey are not in the same sales zone.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Stuckey is in the same sales zone as Udall according to 4.
  Since more sales representatives are in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 according to 5, and Udall is in Zone 3 according to 4. Then, Stuckey must also be in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, and Tiao are in Zones 1 and 2 or Zone 1 only
  However, Parra cannot be in Zone 1 if Tiao is not in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must be in Zone 1 and Parra in Zone 3.
  So, Kim, Mahr, Quinn are in Zone 2 and Udall, Stuckey, and Tiao are in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall— in the three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Actions: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall is also in that zone, since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Zone 1 and Zone 2 must each have exactly one sales representative, and the remaining four sales representatives must be in Zone 3 to meet the condition that there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 
  Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao cannot work in Zone 2, Mahr could work in Zone 1. So, (B) Mahr works in Zone 1 could be true.
  Therefore, the answer is B. Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then either Stuckey or Udall must be in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall must be in Zone 2.
  A: Kim works in Zone 2 - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, there must be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so this cannot be true.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1 - If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, either Stuckey or Udall must be in Zone 1. Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, this means that neither Parra nor Tiao can be in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3 - Parra and Quinn are in the same sales zone, but if Mahr and Stuckey are also in the same sales zone, then there must be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. If Parra were in Zone 3, this would mean that there are only two sales representatives in Zone 3 (Parra and Quinn), which would contradict the given condition. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2 - This is a possible scenario, as long as Udall is also in Zone 2 and Tiao is in Zone 1, which would give a total of three representatives in Zone 3 (Kim, Mahr, and Parra) and two in each of the other two zones (Stuckey and Udall in Zone 2, and Tiao in Zone 1). Therefore, this could be true.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1 - This is also a possible scenario, as long as Parra is in Zone 3 and Udall is in Zone 2, which would give a total of four representatives in Zone 3 (Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Parra), two in Zone 2 (Stuckey and Udall), and one in Zone 1 (Tiao). Therefore, this could be true.
Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives.
  Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall are the names of the sales representatives.
  The sales representatives work in 3 different sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Tiao and Udall cannot both work in Zone 2 since it is already known that Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3. From this, it can be inferred that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Since Tiao already works in Zone 2, Parra must work in Zone 1. Thus, Quinn must work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey, which can only be Zone 3. Finally, Kim must work in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  6. If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, that means one of Mahr or Stuckey is in Zone 3.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 6, Mahr is either in Zone 1 or Zone 3. 
  If Mahr is in Zone 1, then from condition 1, Tiao can not be in Zone 1. 
  If Mahr is in Zone 3, then from condition 5, Stuckey and Udall are also in Zone 3, and hence Tiao and Udall are not in Zone 2. 
  
Answer:
  Neither Kim nor Parra can be in Zone 2. From condition 2, Tiao and Udall can not both be in Zone 2. Therefore, the only possible answer is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives, Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones, Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then neither of them can be in Zone 1, because neither Parra nor Tiao are allowed to work in the same zone as each other. So Mahr and Stuckey must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. There are at most two sales representatives in Zone 2, which means that neither Tiao nor Udall can be in Zone 2. If Kim works in Zone 2, then either Parra or Tiao must be in Zone 1, but this is not possible since both cannot be in the same zone. Therefore, Kim cannot be in Zone 2. 
  
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1. This is not possible because either Parra or Tiao, but not both, works in Zone 1.
  
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so this is possible if Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. 
  
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. This is not possible because if Stuckey is in Zone 2, then Udall must also be in Zone 2, but this violates the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1. This is not possible because either Parra or Tiao, but not both, works in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The sales representatives work in the three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, they must be in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. Any option that contradicts this is incorrect:
  A: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, Kim cannot work in Zone 2 since there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 2. This option is incorrect.
  B: Mahr cannot work in Zone 1 since Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. This option is incorrect.
  C: Parra cannot work in Zone 3 since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. This option is incorrect.
  D: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, Stuckey must be in Zone 2 since there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This option is correct.
  E: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 as either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. This option is incorrect.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?
Choices:
  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant
  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant
  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant
  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy
  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Elimination:
- Choice A cannot be correct because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be next to the optometrist and the veterinarian.
- Choice B is a possible arrangement that satisfies all the constraints given.
- Choice C does not have the pharmacy at the end of the row, and it has the toy store next to the veterinarian, which is not allowed.
- Choice D does not have the pharmacy at one end and does not have the two restaurants separated by at least two other businesses.
- Choice E does not have the pharmacy at one end and has the toy store next to the optometrist.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven businesses that should be located in seven spaces arranged in a straight row. 
  Constraints:
  - The pharmacy must occupy one end and one of the restaurants must occupy the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

A: pharmacy is at one end, which means that the restaurant must be at the other end according to one of the constraints. In this case, the veterinarian is next to the restaurant, which violates one of the constraints that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. So, this option is incorrect.
B: The pharmacy is at one end. The veterinarian is not next to the toy store, which means that the toy store can occupy space two or six. The two restaurants are separated by two businesses, which means that they can only occupy spaces four and seven. The optometrist occupies space three. So, this option satisfies all of the constraints.
C: The restaurant is at space one, which means that the pharmacy must be at space seven according to the constraints. However, the veterinarian and the toy store are next to each other, which violates one of the constraints. So, this option is incorrect.
D: The restaurant is at space one, which means the pharmacy must be at space seven. The toy store is next to the restaurant, which violates one of the constraints. So, this option is incorrect.
E: The restaurant is at space one, which means the pharmacy must be at space seven. The optometrist is next to the toy store, which violates one of the constraints. So, this option is incorrect.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Eliminating options:
  A: The pharmacy cannot be at both of the row. This option is incorrect.
  B: This option satisfies all the constraints, so it could be the correct answer.
  C: The pharmacy is not at an end and the two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses. This option is incorrect.
  D: The two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses and the pharmacy is not at the end of the row. This option is incorrect.
  E: The pharmacy is not at an end and the toy store is next to the veterinarian. This option is incorrect.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant
  - If the pharmacy is at one end and one of the restaurants is at the other, then the pharmacy must be at space 1 and the second restaurant at space 7. Therefore, the first or last space must be one of the restaurants.
  - Based on the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the optometrist can only go in space 2, the veterinarian can only go in space 6.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, either the optometrist or the veterinarian can go in space 3, and the remaining the space 4 with the shoe store. This leaves space 5 for the toy store. 
  - However, this violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 

B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant
  - The pharmacy must be at one end, therefore it must be at space 1. 
  - One of the restaurants must be at the end, therefore it must be at space 7. 
  - Based on the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the veterinarian can only go in space 2.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the shoe store must be in space 3, and the optometrist must be in space 4. This leaves space 5 for the toy store and space 6 for the second restaurant.

C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant
  - The pharmacy must be at one end, therefore it must be at space 7.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the end, therefore it must be at space 1. 
  - Based on the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the veterinarian can only go in space 6.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the optometrist must be in space 2, and the shoe store must be in space 3. This leaves space 4 for the other restaurant, space 5 for the toy store, and space 7 for the pharmacy.

D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy
  - The pharmacy must be at one end, therefore it must be at space 7.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the end, therefore it must be at space 1. 
  - Based on the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the optometrist can only go in space 2. 
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the first restaurant must be in space 4 and the veterinarian must be in space 5. This leaves space 3 for the toy store and space 6 for the shoe store. 
  - This violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy
  - The pharmacy must be at one end, therefore it must be at space 7.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the end, therefore it must be at space 1. 
  - Based on the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the optometrist can only go in space 2.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the second restaurant must be in space 4 and the veterinarian must be in space 5. This leaves space 3 for the toy store and space 6 for the shoe store.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Analysis:
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, we know that the pharmacy and two restaurants must be in spaces 1, 2, and 7.
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, we can combine the pharmacy and two restaurants into a block that looks like this: R_B_R, where R represents a restaurant, B represents a business, and the underscore represents an empty space.
  - Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, we know that the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6.
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, we know that the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
 
Solution:
  Option A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant
  - The pharmacy is not at one end of the row.
  - The two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy is not next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store is next to the veterinarian. 
  Therefore, Option A is not correct.

  Option B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant
  - The pharmacy is at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants is at the other.
  - The two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy is next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store is not next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, Option B is correct.

  Option C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant
  - The pharmacy is not at one end of the row.
  - The two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy is not next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store is next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, Option C is not correct.

  Option D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy
  - The pharmacy is not at one end of the row.
  - The two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy is not next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store is next to the veterinarian. 
  Therefore, Option D is not correct.

  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Analyzing the options:
  A: The pharmacy is at one end, but there's no restaurant at the other. The toy store is next to the veterinarian, so it is incorrect.
  B: The pharmacy is at one end, and a restaurant is at the other. The toy store is not next to the veterinarian, and the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. This option satisfies all the constraints. 
  C: The pharmacy is not at one end, and there's no restaurant at the other. The toy store is next to the veterinarian, so it is incorrect.
  D: The pharmacy is not at one end, and there's more than two businesses between the restaurants. The toy store is next to the veterinarian, so it is incorrect.
  E: The pharmacy is not at one end, and there's more than two businesses between the restaurants. The toy store is next to the optometrist, but that's not the constraint. So, it is incorrect.

  - There are seven clues to be mentioned, one per chapter, in a mystery novel.
  - The chapter order of the clues is subject to certain constraints:
    - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
    - T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating them.
    - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - X is mentioned in chapter 1.
Action: 
  Given that X is mentioned in chapter 1, the following statements could be true:
  - Statement A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, it would break the constraint that T must be mentioned before W with exactly two chapters separating them. Eliminate A.
  - Statement B: If R is mentioned in chapter 7, it would break the constraint that each of the seven clues can only be mentioned once. Eliminate B.
  - Statement C: If S is mentioned in chapter 2, it cannot be followed by Z in chapter 3. Eliminate C.
  - Statement D: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and that would break the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Eliminate D.
  - Statement E: If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, it cannot be followed by S in chapter 4. However, this is still possible given the constraints. Keep E.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The order of the clues is: 1-X, 2-[SZ], 3-[RZ], 4-[UZ], 5-W, 6-[TS], 7-[RW]
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, according to the order, the remaining clues must be arranged as follows:
    - T and W cannot be in chapter 1
    - T must be before W with exactly two chapters in between
    - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters
    - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters
    - U and X must be in adjacent chapters
    
Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, and T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3: If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5 and R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7: If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5 and R must be mentioned in chapter 7. This is a possible order.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2: If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 3 and T must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and R must be mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, this option is possible.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3: If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2, and T must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("BD")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The author is planning a mystery novel with seven chapters and seven different clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z) to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, but must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, but U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must also be mentioned in chapter 2.

A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T is either mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4. However, neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4 if R is in chapter 3, so this option is not possible.
B: If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5 and W must be mentioned in chapter 7. If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2, and therefore U and W would be consecutive, violating the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, this option is not possible.
C: If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then either T or U must be mentioned in chapter 4. However, if U is mentioned in chapter 4, then X must be mentioned in chapter 3, which is not possible since X is already mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4, making W be in chapter 6, and Z be in chapter 7. This satisfies all the constraints, so this option is possible.
D: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, U in chapter 4, X in chapter 1, and Z in chapter 7. However, this arrangement violates the constraint that T must be mentioned before W but must be separated by exactly two chapters. Therefore, this option is not possible.
E: If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4. But if S is in chapter 1, then X must be in chapter 2, which is not possible since X is already mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are seven clues to be mentioned, one per chapter from 1 to 7.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, but T must be mentioned before W.
  There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Solution:
If X is mentioned in chapter 1, W must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 5. 

Option A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2, but S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so option A is not possible.

Option B: If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6, so W must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4. However, X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters with W, so option B is not possible.

Option C: If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, but W must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, which violates the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, option C is not possible.

Option D: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, so X must be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, option D is possible.

Option E: If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2, but S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so option E is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The seven clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each clue appears exactly once, one per chapter.
  Clues T and W have specific constraints on their position relative to each other.
  Clues S and Z cannot appear in adjacent chapters.
  Clues W and X cannot appear in adjacent chapters.
  Clues U and X must appear in adjacent chapters.
  X is mentioned in chapter 1.

Analysis:
  Since U and X must appear in adjacent chapters, U must appear in chapter 2. 
  The only possible location for W is chapter 4. Therefore, T must appear in either chapter 3 or 5.
  If T appears in chapter 3, the only possible location for R is chapter 7.
  If T appears in chapter 5, the earliest possible location for R would be chapter 3, and it can only be adjacent to S or Z. However, since S and Z cannot be adjacent, R cannot be in chapter 3.
  Clue S cannot appear in chapters 1, 2, or 3 because of the constraint with Z and the clue T must be separated from W by exactly two chapters.
  Clue Z cannot appear in chapters 3, 4, or 5 because of the constraint with S.

Action: Answer("B") 
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, the earliest chapter that can contain T is chapter 3.
  Therefore, R must appear in chapter 7, and the only possible choice is (B).
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven clues to be mentioned in a mystery novel: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each clue will appear in exactly one chapter in the novel.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. 
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, clue W must appear in Chapter 3 and T must appear in either chapter 5 or chapter 6. This information will help eliminate some options from the choices.
  
  A: If R is mentioned in Chapter 3, then T has to be mentioned in Chapter 2 which is not possible. Eliminated.
  B: If R is mentioned in Chapter 7, then S and Z have to be mentioned in Chapters 5 and 6, but since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, this is not possible. Eliminated.
  C: If S is mentioned in Chapter 2, then R has to appear in  Chapter 4 or later and W has to appear in  chapter 3, which is not possible. Eliminated.
  D: If W is mentioned in Chapter 5, then T has to be mentioned in either Chapter 3 or Chapter 4 and R has to be mentioned in Chapter 7, this is possible.
  E: If Z is mentioned in Chapter 3, then S has to be mentioned in Chapter 4 and W has to appear in Chapter 6, which is not possible. Eliminated.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 different clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each clue is mentioned exactly once.
  There are seven chapters, and each chapter contains one clue.
  There are some constraints to the order of the clues:
    1. T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
    2. T must be mentioned before W.
    3. There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
    4. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    5. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    6. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    
Plan:
If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2. Also, W cannot be in chapter 2, because it has to come after T, which cannot be in chapter 1. R, S, and Z must be spread out in the remaining chapters. 

Checking the answer choices:
  A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be in chapter 2, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be in chapter 6, which would violate the constraint that S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z must be in chapter 4, which would violate the constraint that S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters. Therefore, C is not true.
  D: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T would have to be mentioned in chapter 3, which violates the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, D is not true.
  E: If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2 and W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which would violate the constraint that S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters and the constraint that W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters. Therefore, E is not true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z will be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. 
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. 
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then:
- U must be in chapter 2.
- W must be in chapter 4.
- T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Since W is in Chapter 4, T cannot be in Chapter 1, Chapter 2, or Chapter 3. That leaves Chapter 5 or Chapter 6.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. They must be in Chapter 3 and Chapter 5 or Chapter 6, in some order.
- That leaves R to be mentioned in Chapter 7.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. - R cannot be in Chapter 3 because both S and Z are mentioned before R. Incorrect.
B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. - This is correct according to the previous deductions. Answer("B").
C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. - S must be mentioned after Chapter 3 and before Chapter 7. Incorrect.
D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. - W must be mentioned in Chapter 4. Incorrect.
E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. - Z cannot be in Chapter 3 because both S and Z are mentioned before R. Incorrect.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The novel consists of seven chapters.
  Each of seven different clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W.
  There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Since X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be in chapter 2. Therefore, W must be in chapter 4 and T must be in chapter 6. Thus, R cannot be in chapter 3 as it would violate the constraint of two chapters separating T and W. 
S and Z cannot be in chapters 1, 2 or 3 as they would not comply with the restriction against having them in adjacent chapters. 

Action: Answer("D") 
W is mentioned in chapter 5 if X is mentioned in chapter 1.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z must be mentioned each in one of the chapters 1 through 7.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, separated by exactly two chapters.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  From the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, it follows that X is mentioned in chapter 1, and U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  From the constraint that Z cannot be mentioned in an adjacent chapter to S, it follows that S is not in chapter 3.
  Since X is in chapter 1 and W cannot be adjacent to X, W cannot be in chapter 2.
  Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, T must be mentioned in some chapter after chapter 1, but it must be before W.
  From the constraint that T is between X and W, we can infer that T is in either chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  Thus, the only option that is possible with this configuration is W in chapter 5, which satisfies the requirement that T is exactly two chapters away from W. Therefore, the answer is (D) W is mentioned in chapter 5.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are six photographs in total, exactly two photographs in each section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E") 

If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then:
- It means that there are no Gagnon's photos in the other two sections.
- There must be at least two photographs by each of the other two photographers in the section where there are two photographs by Gagnon.
- From the given choices, the only option that satisfies this condition is for both photographs in the Sports section to be by Hue (they can't be both by Fuentes, because then Fuentes would have three photos in that section, violating the constraint that a photographer can have at most 3 photos in a section).
- This would mean that there are no Gagnon's photos in the Sports section, and either one or two Gagnon's photos in each of the other two sections.
- Because there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section from a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon does not have any photographs in the Sports section, neither Gagnon nor Hue can have both of their photographs in the Metro section (because then the other two photographers would have to have both of their photographs in the Lifestyle section, leaving no Fuentes or Hue photograph for the Metro section).
- Therefore, the only option that could be true is that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, which satisfies all the given constraints.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 different photographs in total, and 2 photographs are in each section (Lifestyle, Metro, Sports).
  - The photographs are taken by 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Analysis:
  - If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, this means that Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  - From the given conditions, we know that there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, which means that Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Sports section to satisfy the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - Therefore, one of the photographs in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Choice B is the only option that satisfies the given conditions. Hence, it could be true that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  * There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  * There are 6 different photographs, exactly two for each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
  * For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  * At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  * The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  * None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: If both photographs in one of the three sections (let's say Metro) are by Gagnon, this means that Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, and therefore the two photographs in Sports must be either by Fuentes or Hue. Also, since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, this means that one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Gagnon. The only way for the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section to be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section is to have both photographs in the Lifestyle section by Hue, and both photographs in the Sports section by Hue as well. Therefore, the answer is E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 different photographs, exactly 2 photographs per section. 
  Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, which means Gagnon has one section with both his photographs, then the total number of his photos must be at least 3, and none of them is in the Sports section. Therefore, only the Lifestyle and Metro sections contain Gagnon's photographs. By the rule “At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section,” we can conclude that both the Lifestyle and Metro sections contain photographs by more than one photographer.

Option A is not possible because there must be at least one Gagnon's photo in one of the sections.

Option B is not possible because one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and we have assumed both photos in one of the sections are by Gagnon.

Option C is not possible because no Gagnon's photos are in the Metro section.

Option D is possible because we can have one photograph by Gagnon and one by Hue in the Metro section.

Option E is not possible because Fuentes must have the same number of photographs as Hue in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Six different photographs are to appear.
  - Exactly two photographs per section.
  - At least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then:
- There will be no Gagnon photograph in the Lifestyle and Sports sections.
- There will be two Gagnon photographs in the remaining section.
- There will be at least one Fuentes or Hue photograph in the Lifestyle section, which will also need to have a photograph by Gagnon.
- There will be at least one Fuentes or Hue photograph in the section where there are no Gagnon photographs.

A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. -> This is not possible because there needs to be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. -> This is possible because both Fuentes and Hue can have photographs in the Lifestyle section, and one of these two photographers can have a photograph in the Metro section as well.
C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. -> This is not possible because there needs to be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and if both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there will be no photograph by another photographer in the Metro section.
D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. -> This is possible because there will be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and there will be one photograph by Hue in the remaining section, and at least one photograph by Fuentes or Hue in the Lifestyle section.
E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. -> This is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Six photos will be published, with each section containing two photos.
  - For each photographer, there must be at least one but no more than three photos.
  - There must be at least one photo in Lifestyle by a photographer who has at least one photo in Metro.
  - Fuentes and Hue must have the same number of photos in Lifestyle and Sports.
  - Gagnon cannot have any photos in Sports.
  
Action: Based on the constraints, we can eliminate choices A, C, and E because they violate one or more of the conditions. 

Option B could be true. 
If there are two photos in Lifestyle that are both by Hue, then there must be at least one photo in Metro that is by Fuentes. The remaining photo(s) in Metro can be by Gagnon. Then, in the Sports section, Fuentes and Hue will each have one photo. Gagnon's photos will be in Metro and Lifestyle.

Option D could also be true. 
If both photos in a Metro section are by Gagnon, then the photographers in the other two sections must be Fuentes and Hue. We know Fuentes must have at least one photo in Sports, so the other photo in Sports must be by Hue. In Lifestyle, Fuentes and Hue will each have one photo.

Thus, the answer is either B or D. Neither one is more likely than the other based on the given information.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each section must have exactly 2 photographs.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  At least one Lifestyle photograph must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then it means that Gagnon has a total of two or three photographs in that section. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, neither of the two photographs in the Sports section can be by Gagnon.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. This is possible, but then there would be no Gagnon photographs in the Lifestyle section
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. This is possible. The Metro section could have two Gagnon photographs, and the Sports section could have one photograph each by Fuentes and Hue.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible, since at least one Lifestyle photograph must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. This is possible, but then there would be no Gagnon photographs in the Sports section.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible, since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in the Sports section, and if both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then there would be no Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  
  Therefore, the only possible option is B, where one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. The Metro section could have two Gagnon photographs, and the Sports section could have one photograph each by Fuentes and Hue.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each of the three sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) should have exactly two photographs.
  Each photographer should have at least one but no more than three photographs in each section.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, we can divide into three cases:
  Case 1: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Gagnon.
  Case 2: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  Case 3: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Gagnon.
  
  From the constraints, we know that:
  1- At least 1 photograph in Lifestyle must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro.
  2- All three photographers must have 2 photographs in total in Lifestyle and Metro sections combined.
  3- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  4- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in the Sports section.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. This is not possible because Case 1 (both Lifestyle by Gagnon) already violates the rule that there must be at least 1 photographer in Lifestyle who has a photograph in Metro.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. This is possible. Since one of the Lifestyle photos is by Fuentes, there must be at least one Fuentes photo in Metro. Since Gagnon has both Metro photos, there is exactly one Gagnon photo in Lifestyle. This means the remaining photo in Lifestyle must be taken by Hue.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible since Gagnon has both Metro photos.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. This is possible. Since Gagnon has both Metro photos, one of the two Lifestyle photos must be taken by Hue. Since the number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle and Fuentes' photos in Sports is equal, the other Sports photo must be taken by Gagnon. Then, there is only one possible combination for both Lifestyle photos, and this combination does not violate any of the given constraints.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible since Gagnon cannot have any photos in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The sections where the photographs will appear are Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are three photographers available: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each section must have exactly two photographs and no photographer can have more than three photographs in total.
  - There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes's photographs in the Sports section.
  - Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("E")  
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the only section where there could be photographs by Gagnon is in the Lifestyle or Metro section. However, we know that in the Lifestyle section there must be a photograph by a photographer who also has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Metro section, it follows that both photographs in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Gagnon. This eliminates options A and B. Similarly, Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, so both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Gagnon. This eliminates option E. This leaves us with option C and D as possible answers. However, option C cannot be true because each photographer can have at most three photographs in total, and if both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there would be three photographs by Fuentes and none left for the Sports section. Therefore, the only possible answer is option D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - 6 photographs are to appear in total, with 2 photographs appearing in each of the 3 sections.
  - The photographers are Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer must have at least one photograph but no more than three in total.
  - There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("A") 

If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then the only section remaining is the Sports section. Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, neither of the photographs in that section can be taken by Gagnon. 

Therefore, there are no photographs by Gagnon in the Sports section. Since there are only three photographers, each photographer must appear in each section at least once. That means Gagnon must have one photograph each in the Lifestyle and Metro sections. 

Since Gagnon already has two photographs in the Lifestyle and Metro sections combined, Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, there cannot be any photographs in the Sports section by Hue or Fuentes. That means both photographs in the Sports section must be taken by Gagnon. 

According to the last constraint, Hue and Fuentes must each have the same number of photographs in the Lifestyle and Sports sections respectively. Since Gagnon already has two photographs in the Metro section, and there can only be one more photograph in the Metro section, it cannot be by Fuentes. That means the photograph in the Metro section by Hue. Then, by the same reasoning, the photograph in the Lifestyle section also must be by Hue. Therefore, A is the correct answer and both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and also earlier than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or earlier than the vase, but not both.
  
A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, meaning that the table cannot be auctioned before the vase, which is a contradiction.
B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the harmonica must be auctioned earlier than the lamp, meaning that the lamp is already the second antique to be auctioned. This would imply that the mirror is auctioned on June 3rd or later, contradicting the fact that it should be earlier than the lamp. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial or the table must be auctioned on June 1st, making the harmonica the third antique to be auctioned on June 3rd or later. But then, there would be a contradiction between the conditions that the table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica and that the table is auctioned earlier than the vase. Therefore, C cannot be true.
D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd and the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or 3rd. Since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which satisfies all of the given conditions. Therefore, D could be true.
E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica must be auctioned either on June 3rd or 4th, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or 5th. But then, there would be a contradiction between the conditions that the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp and that the mirror is auctioned earlier than the lamp. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
- The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
- The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase but not both.

Analyzing the answer choices:
- A: There are only two dates before June 2nd and the earliest possible date for the mirror is June 3rd because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the mirror can't be auctioned on June 2nd. 
- B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp and the sundial must also be auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, the only possible order on June 2nd is harmonica, sundial, lamp. However, the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, and the table can't be auctioned on June 2nd. Thus, the lamp can't be auctioned on June 2nd.
- C: The vase must be auctioned after the sundial, so it can't be auctioned on June 2nd.
- D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp and the sundial must also be auctioned before the lamp. The earliest possible date for the harmonica is June 2nd. Thus, the order on June 2nd must be harmonica, sundial, lamp, with the table, mirror, and vase being auctioned on the remaining dates. This order satisfies all the conditions, so it is possible for the lamp to be auctioned on June 3rd.
- E: The earliest possible date for the mirror is June 3rd, after the harmonica and the lamp. The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, so it can't be auctioned on June 5th. Therefore, the mirror can't be auctioned on June 5th.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. 
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. 
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. 
  - The table is auctioned before either the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - A: We know the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and that it is auctioned before the mirror, so the mirror cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.
  - B: This is possible since we do not have any constraints related to the lamp on June 2nd. 
  - C: This is not possible because the sundial is auctioned before the vase. 
  - D: This is not possible because the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both. If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, it would mean that the table was auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which violates the constraint. 
  - E: This is possible because there are no constraints related to the mirror being auctioned on June 5th.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six antiques to be auctioned: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
  - The auction will take place over six consecutive days (June 1 through June 6).
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and vase.
  - The table is auctioned either before the harmonica OR before the vase (but not both).
  
Analysis:
  - The first day's auction (June 1) cannot be the sundial.
  - The table is auctioned before either the harmonica or the vase. If the table is not auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica and vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st either. Therefore, the only possible antiques to be auctioned on June 1st are the lamp, mirror, or sundial.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and vase.
  - Therefore, the sundial will be auctioned on either June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th. This implies that the vase must be auctioned on either June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The lamp could be auctioned on June 3rd. If the table is auctioned before the harmonica, then the table could be auctioned on June 1st. This would mean that the harmonica and vase would be auctioned on June 2nd and June 4th (in some order), leaving the lamp, mirror, and sundial to be auctioned on June 3rd, June 5th, and June 6th (in some order).
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and earlier than the vase.
  The table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or earlier than the vase, but not both.
  There are six antiques that will be auctioned, one per day for six consecutive days.
  
Analysis:
  If we start with June 1st and use the given information to place the items in order, we can determine which antiques could be auctioned on June 2nd.
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  We also know that the table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or earlier than the vase, but not both. This means that the table could be auctioned on June 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. If the table is auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, then the harmonica and vase must be auctioned on later dates.
  From the given information, we know that if the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp. This means that either the lamp is auctioned before the harmonica and the mirror, or the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp and the mirror.
  We also know that the sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and earlier than the vase. This means that the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or 6th. 

Answer: 
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. (This cannot be true because the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, leaving no room for the mirror.) 
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. (This could be true if the table is auctioned on June 1st and the harmonica and vase are auctioned on later dates.)
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd. (This cannot be true because the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or 6th.)
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. (This cannot be true because the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd and the table may be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd.)
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. (This could be true if the table is auctioned on June 1st and the harmonica and vase are auctioned on later dates.) 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Six antiques (harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, vase) are auctioned on six consecutive days (June 1st through June 6th).
- Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
- Sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
- Table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
- Sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, but it must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase. So, there are only two possible dates for the sundial: June 2nd or June 3rd.
- If the table is auctioned before the harmonica, then it must be auctioned on June 1st. However, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so the table must be auctioned before the vase.
- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp. If we assume that the table is auctioned before the harmonica, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later (because the table is not auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp must be auctioned after the harmonica). This means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or earlier.

Action: Answer("A") 

Therefore, the mirror could be auctioned on June 2nd, so A is the correct answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  - The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Action: 
  - To determine the possible options, let's follow the conditions:
      - From the condition 3, we can determine that the sundial is auctioned on either June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
      - From the condition 4, we can determine that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror will also be auctioned before the lamp. Either harmonica or the lamp can be auctioned on June 1st.
      - From the condition 2, if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp.
      - From the condition 6, we can determine that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the table is auctioned before the vase, but not both. So, we can determine that either the table is auctioned on June 1st or 2nd.
  - Now, we can check our options based on the conditions:
      - Option A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. Then, the lamp must be auctioned after the mirror, which violates the third condition. So, A is not true.
      - Option B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. Then, either the table or the sundial is auctioned on June 1st, no other antique can be auctioned on June 1st. Also, from the condition 4, if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before. Also, the mirror should be before the lamp following condition 2. So, the order becomes: 
        June 1: Sundial or table
        June 2: Harmonica, mirror, lamp
        June 3: Vase
        June 4: Table or sundial
        June 5: Mirror or vase
        June 6: Lamp or harmonica
        This is a valid arrangement. So, B is true.
      - Option C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. Then, based on condition 3, the sundial must be auctioned before the vase, which violates the condition. So, C is not true.
      - Option D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. Then, either the table or the sundial is auctioned on June 1st, which violates the condition 6. So, D is not true.
      - Option E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. Then, the order becomes:
        June 1: Sundial or table
        June 2: Harmonica or lamp
        June 3: Vase
        June 4: Table or sundial
        June 5: Mirror
        June 6: Lamp or harmonica
        This is a valid arrangement. So, E is true.
Answer: Answer("B") and Answer("E").
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
- The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
- The table is auctioned before either the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then both the harmonica and the lamp must have been auctioned before the mirror. This implies either the vase or the sundial was auctioned on June 1st, but neither of them can be auctioned on the first day. Therefore, this cannot be true.
B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must have been auctioned before the lamp. This implies that the mirror must also have been auctioned before the lamp. The only item that can be auctioned on June 1st is the table, as both the sundial and the vase must be auctioned after the mirror. Therefore, this could be true.
C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then both the harmonica and the lamp must have been auctioned before the vase. This implies that the mirror must have also been auctioned before the vase. The sundial must have been auctioned on June 1st and the table cannot be auctioned before the harmonica. Therefore, this cannot be true.
D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must have been auctioned before the lamp. This implies that the mirror must have also been auctioned before the lamp. The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd. The table cannot be auctioned before the harmonica. Therefore, this cannot be true.
E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned before the lamp, as the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp. The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd. The table must be auctioned before the vase and it cannot be auctioned before the harmonica. Therefore, this cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- There are six antiques to be auctioned from June 1st through June 6th.
- The order of auction can be determined by the given conditions. 
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp.
- The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror, and also earlier than the vase.
- The table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or earlier than the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
- We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it can be auctioned on June 2nd at the earliest.
- The harmonica and the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the table has to be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but the sundial has to be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. So, the earliest date when the table can be auctioned is June 3rd. Therefore, the lamp and harmonica can only be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
- If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp. This means that if the lamp is auctioned on June 4th, the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. If the lamp is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
- The table must be auctioned before the vase, so the earliest date when the vase can be auctioned is June 5th.

Action: Answer("D") - The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 antiques to be auctioned: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
  - There are 6 auction days: June 1-6.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  - If harmonica < lamp, then mirror < lamp.
  - If sundial is auctioned, then sundial < mirror and sundial < vase.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd or later. However, if the harmonica is later than the lamp, the only way the mirror can be earlier than the lamp is if it is auctioned either on June 2nd or June 3rd, which violates the condition that the sundial must be earlier than the mirror. Therefore, table cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica or the vase must be auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must be auctioned either on June 1st or June 2nd, which violates the condition that the sundial must be earlier than the mirror. Therefore, the vase must be auctioned on June 1st.
  - Using the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both, and the fact the vase is auctioned on June 1st, we know that the table must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  - By analyzing all the given conditions, we find that the complete ordering of the auctions must be as follows: 
    June 1st: Vase
    June 2nd: Table
    June 3rd: Sundial
    June 4th: Harmonica
    June 5th: Lamp
    June 6th: Mirror

Action: Answer("A") - The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. (This statement is true according to the complete ordering of the auctions calculated earlier.)

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

  Southco has 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp has 3 class 2 buildings: King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building.
  Trades can only occur within the same class of buildings or between classes as specified.
Analysis:
  A: RealProp owns only 1 class 1 building, and none of the class 2 buildings, so this statement cannot be true.
  B: Southco owns only 2 buildings, Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2), so this statement cannot be true.
  C: Trustcorp owns only 3 class 2 buildings, King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building, so this statement cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp does not own the Yates House (class 3), so this statement cannot be true.
  E: RealProp does not own the Lynch Building (class 2), so this statement cannot be true.
Action: Answer("A")

  - Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  - Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building (all class 2).
  - There are 3 types of trades: 1-for-1 trade of same class, 1-for-2 trade of class 1 and class 2, and 1-for-2 trade of class 2 and class 3.
  
Analysis:
  A: Trustcorp, not RealProp, owns the Meyer and Ortiz Buildings.
  B: Southco does not own the Meyer Building, which is owned by Trustcorp.
  C: Southco does not own the King Building, which is owned by Trustcorp. RealProp does not own any building that is not listed in the knowledge.

Knowledge:
  The buildings owned by RealProp are the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Trades must involve buildings of the same class or trades must involve a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: The King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building are all owned by Trustcorp, and they are all class 2 buildings. Whereas the buildings owned by RealProp are the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Therefore, no matter how many trades are made, the buildings owned by RealProp cannot be the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, making choice A impossible.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- RealProp owns 3 buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3)
- Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2)
- Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
- There are three types of trades allowed.
- We need to find the option that is not possible, regardless of how many trades are made.

Analysis:
- Option A: The Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building are owned by Trustcorp; therefore, the buildings owned by RealProp cannot be the same as Trustcorp's buildings. This option is not possible.
- Option B: The Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, so it cannot also be owned by Southco. This option is not possible.
- Option C: Southco owns only 2 buildings, so it cannot own 3 buildings. This option is not possible.
- Option D: The Yates House is owned by RealProp, and the Flores Tower is owned by Southco, so neither of these buildings can be owned by Trustcorp. This option is not possible.
- Option E: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and the Lynch Building is owned by Southco, so neither of these buildings can be owned by Trustcorp. This option is not possible.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  
Analysis:
  A: RealProp cannot own the buildings owned by Trustcorp based on the information given.
  B: Southco cannot own the Meyer Building based on the information given.
  C: There are no class 3 buildings owned by Trustcorp to trade for a class 2 building.
  D: The Yates House is owned by RealProp and cannot be owned by Trustcorp based on the information given.
  E: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and cannot be owned by Trustcorp based on the information given.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns 3 buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns 2 buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings: King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building (all class 2).
  Only one kind of trade is allowed; each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We can rule out any trade that violates the rules of these kinds of trades.
  
Analysis:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are all class 1 or class 3. This is impossible because Trustcorp owns all the class 2 buildings.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco include the Meyer Building, which is owned by Trustcorp. This is impossible because no company can trade a building it does not own.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco include the King Building and the Ortiz Building, which are both owned by Trustcorp. This is impossible because no company can trade a building it does not own.
  D: The Yates House, which is owned by RealProp, is class 3. Therefore, it cannot be owned by Trustcorp, which owns only class 2 buildings.
  E: The Garza Tower, which is owned by RealProp, is class 1. Therefore, it cannot be owned by Trustcorp, which owns only class 2 buildings.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). 
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class; Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings; Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  A cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of those buildings.
  B and C cannot be true because Southco does not own the Meyer Building and the King or Ortiz Building at the same time.
  D cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Flores Tower.
  E cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The manager of the photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available — Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays — but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. 
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis: 
  We need to find a possible combination of photographers that can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony while satisfying all the given constraints.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one ceremony. Hence, any combination that includes Frost should also include Heideck.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony if Lai is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. However, we are only looking for combinations of photographers that can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.

Action: Answer("B")  

Explanation: 
  The only possible combination that satisfies given constraints is Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck. It satisfies the requirement that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together and Gonzalez must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Since we cannot assign Knutson to the Thorne University ceremony, we cannot assign Lai and Mays together, which eliminates options A and E. Option C does not have enough photographers, and option D does not include Gonzalez or Knutson. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The manager of the photography business must assign at least two photographers to each graduation ceremony.
- Exactly six photographers are available.
- Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
- No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
- If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
- If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
- If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Elimination:
- (A) violates the rule that only two photographers can be assigned to each ceremony.
- (B) can't be correct because it only has three photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony, and the question states that at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.
- (C) can't be correct because it only has two photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony, and the question states that at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.
- (D) can't be correct because it doesn't include enough photographers to assign at least two to the Silva University ceremony.
- (E) satisfies the requirement that at least two photographers must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the graduation ceremonies. Gonzalez and Lai must be assigned to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis: Since we know that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the graduations, if they are assigned to the Silva University ceremony, that leaves us with the need for at least one more photographer for that ceremony. This means that Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which satisfies the constraint that Gonzalez cannot be assigned to Silva if Lai is also assigned to Silva. We also know that Knutson must be assigned to Thorne if Heideck is also assigned to Thorne. That means we have Gonzalez left to assign to the Silva University ceremony, which satisfies the constraint
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The manager must select at least two photographers for each ceremony.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck at one ceremony.
  Lai and Mays must be assigned to different ceremonies if both are assigned.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson - Heideck and Frost must be together, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so this is not a possible assignment to the Silva University ceremony.
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck - Frost and Heideck must be together, Gonzalez assigned to Silva University satisfies the conditions, so this is a possible assignment to the Silva University ceremony.
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson - At least two photographers must be assigned to Silva University, so this is not a possible assignment.
  D: Heideck, Lai - At least two photographers must be assigned to Silva University, but Lai cannot be assigned to Silva University with Gonzalez assigned to Thorne University. This is not a possible assignment.
  E: Knutson, Mays - At least two photographers must be assigned to Silva University, but if Knutson is assigned to Silva University, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to Thorne University. This is not a possible assignment.
  
Action: Answer("B") - Frost, Gonzalez and Heideck can be assigned to Silva University ceremony.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The manager must assign at least two photographers to each ceremony and can use at most 6 photographers.
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  Lai and Mays can't be assigned to the same ceremony.
  
Elimination:
  A: This assignment has Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, and Knutson, but if Frost and Heideck are assigned together, there must be at least 4 photographers in that ceremony, and this only has 3. So, this option is incorrect.
  B: This assignment has Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck, and if Frost and Heideck are assigned together there must be at least one more photographer in that ceremony. One possible solution is to assign Knutson and Lai to Thorne University. So, this option is a possible solution.
  C: This assignment only has Gonzalez and Knutson. There must be at least two photographers in each ceremony. So, this option is incorrect.
  D: This assignment only has Heideck and Lai. There must be at least two photographers in each ceremony. So, this option is incorrect.
  E: This assignment only has Knutson and Mays. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so this is not a possible solution.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The manager of the photography business must assign at least two photographers to each graduation ceremony.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  The Silva University ceremony requires at least two photographers, but no more than four.
  The following rules must be considered in order to find out which of the options is correct:

  1) Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  2) If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  3) If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

  Let's see which option meets all the constraints:

  A) Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one ceremony already. It is not possible to assign Gonzalez and Knutson to this ceremony as well, since the only remaining option is Lai, who must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony if Gonzalez is at the Silva University ceremony.
  B) Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one ceremony already. The only remaining option is Gonzalez. Therefore, the total number of photographers at the Silva University ceremony would be three, which complies with the requirements of the problem.

  C) Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.

  D) Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one ceremony already, while Lai and Mays must be assigned to different ceremonies. Therefore, it is not possible to assign Heideck and Lai to the Silva University ceremony.

  E) Mays can only be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony if Knutson is not assigned to it.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
- Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
- No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
- Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
- If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
- If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
- If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
From the given constraints we can conclude that assignment of Frost necessitates the assignment of Heideck and vice versa. This means that both must either be assigned to the Silva ceremony or the Thorne ceremony. However, if Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be. Thus, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne ceremony. 
Furthermore, if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne ceremony. 
If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. Given this, we can put Frost and Heideck together on the Silva ceremony and Gonzalez, Lai, Knutson, and Mays on the Thorne ceremony. Thus, choice B is correct.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each graduation ceremony.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Elimination:
  A: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so they can´t be apart.
     Also, Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
     This assignment has Frost, Heideck, and Knutson assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which violates the constraints.
  B: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. This diminshes the possibilities for the Silva University ceremony, so this option is unlikely.
  C: This option does not satisfy the constraint that at least two photographers must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  D: This option does not satisfy the constraint that at least two photographers must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  E: Gonzalez is not assigned to the Silva University ceremony, so this option violates the constraint that If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Each graduation ceremony needs at least two photographers.
- Six photographers are available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai and Mays.
- Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
- No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
- If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
- If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
- If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
- For Silva University ceremony, we need 2 photographers.
- Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
- No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
- If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
- Therefore, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Thorne university.
- If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
- Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. Therefore, Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony together with another photographer.
- Lai and Mays cannot be both assigned to the Silva ceremony. 

Action: Answer("B")  
Therefore, the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony could be Frost, Gonzalez and Heideck.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are two ceremonies: Silva University and Thorne University.
  - At least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.
  - Exactly six photographers are available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  - No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  - Frost must be assigned with Heideck to one of the ceremonies.
  - If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Solution:
  We need to find a valid assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony based on the constraints given.
  According to the constraints, if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony if Lai is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Also, Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies. Therefore, they cannot both be assigned to the Silva University ceremony since we need at least two photographers to be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Since Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  According to the constraints, if Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. Therefore, we cannot assign both Lai and Mays to the Silva University ceremony.
  Based on the above reasoning, the only possible valid assignment to the Silva University ceremony is: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
To create a timeline of the order of recruitment, we know that:
- Peters was recruited fourth, so we can put him in the middle of our timeline.
- Stanton was not immediately before or after Tao, which means Tao cannot be recruited first or seventh.
- Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White.
Given that the suspect recruited people one at a time, Candidate E - White was recruited third cannot be true because Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, White cannot be recruited third.
A: Quinn was recruited third is possible.
B: Rovero was recruited fifth is possible.
C: Stanton was recruited sixth is not possible because Tao was recruited second and Stanton was not immediately before or after Tao.
D: Villas was recruited sixth is not possible because Peters was already recruited fourth.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Peters was recruited fourth, and the criminal recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. Tao was recruited second.
  
Using the given information, the order of the recruits must be: Peters, ___, Tao, ___, Villas, White, ___. 

If Tao was recruited second, the possible order of recruits after him/her could be: Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, White, then Peters or Villas.

A: Quinn was recruited third. Possible.
B: Rovero was recruited fifth. Possible.
C: Stanton was recruited sixth. Not possible because the order would be Villas, White, Stanton, Peters or Quinn, Rovero, Tao.
D: Villas was recruited sixth. Not possible because the order would be White, Villas, Stanton, Peters or Quinn, Rovero, Tao.
E: White was recruited third. Possible.

Action: Answer("A")

  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time and Peters was recruited fourth.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited fourth, that means Tao was recruited before Peters, which leaves only two possible positions for Peters: third and fifth.
  If Tao was recruited second and Quinn was recruited later than Rovero, that means Tao was recruited before Quinn and Rovero, which limits the possible positions for Quinn and Rovero: third and fourth or fourth and fifth.
  Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, and Peters was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, that means Peters cannot be fifth and Villas cannot be sixth.
  Based on this, the only possible position for Villas is fifth, as she was recruited just before White.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, if Tao was recruited second, it could be true that Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5. The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited third. There are no constraints on who was recruited before Peters or after Tao. 
  A: There is no information about when Quinn was recruited in relation to Peters.
  B: If Tao was recruited second, then Rovero was either recruited fourth or fifth. So, it could be true that Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: If Tao was recruited second, and Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao, then Stanton was not recruited sixth because if Stanton was sixth, then Tao should have been recruited fifth. Thus, Stanton could not be sixth.
  D: If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then Villas was recruited fifth. But, if Rovero was fifth, then it conflicts with Villas being fifth. 
  E: There is no information about when White was recruited in relation to Peters.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
 - Tao was recruited second.
 - Peters was recruited fourth.
 - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
 - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
 - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
 
Analysis:
 - Peters must come before Rovero and White.
 - Tao cannot be immediately followed by Stanton
 - Therefore, possible orders: 
   1st: P      2nd: T      3rd: Q,R,V,W    4th: P      5th: Q,R,V,W     6th: Q,R,V,W     7th: Q,R,V,W 
   1st: P      2nd: T      3rd: Q,R,V,W    4th: P      5th: Q,R,V,W     6th: Q,R,V,W     7th: T
 - From the above options, the only possibility would be that Quinn was recruited third.
 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Seven accomplices were recruited one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
If Tao was recruited second, then:
  Peters was recruited before Tao, 
  Tao was recruited second, 
  Five more people were recruited after Tao in the following order: Villas, White, ?, ?, and ?. 
  
Option A is possible because if Quinn was recruited third, then the order would be Peters, Tao, Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, and Stanton.

Option B is not possible because if Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order would be Peters, Tao, Villas, White, Rovero, ?, and Stanton. However, we know that Villas was recruited immediately before White and that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Rovero cannot be recruited fifth.

Option C is not possible because if Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order would be Peters, Tao, Villas, White, ?, Stanton, and Rovero. However, we know that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited sixth.

Option D is not possible because if Villas was recruited sixth, then the order would be Peters, Tao, Villas, White, Rovero, ?, and Stanton. However, we know that Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, Villas cannot be recruited sixth.

Option E is not possible because if White was recruited third, then the order would be Peters, Tao, White, Villas, ?, ?, and Stanton. However, we know that Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, White cannot be recruited third.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The criminal recruited 7 accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Tao was recruited second, the possible order of recruitment for the other 6 accomplices would be: 
  1. {empty}
  2. Tao
  3. {unknown}
  4. {unknown}
  5. {unknown}
  6. {unknown}
  7. {unknown}

  Therefore:
  A: If Tao was recruited second, Quinn cannot be recruited third because Quinn is recruited before Rovero.
  B: If Tao was recruited second, it’s possible that Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: If Tao was recruited second, it’s possible that Stanton was recruited sixth since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  D: If Tao was recruited second, it’s not possible that Villas was recruited sixth because Peters was recruited fourth and Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  E: If Tao was recruited second, it’s not possible that White was recruited third because Peters was recruited fourth.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1) The suspect recruited accomplices one at a time.
  2) Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3) Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  4) Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  5) Peters was recruited fourth.
  6) If Tao was recruited second, then there are only two possible positions for Stanton; one is third and other is sixth.
  7) Since Peters was recruited fourth, Tao cannot be immediately before or after Peters.
  8) Therefore, Tao can only be immediately before Quinn or Rovero.
  A: If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn cannot be recruited third.
  B: If Tao was recruited second, then Rovero cannot be recruited fifth.
  C: If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton can only be recruited sixth.
  D: Yes, if Tao was recruited second, then Villas could be recruited sixth.
  E: If Tao was recruited second, then White cannot be recruited third.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Tao was recruited second, so the order is: [1] Tao, [2], ?, [3], [4] Peters, [5], [6], [7] White.
- Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton must be either 1st, 3rd, 5th or 7th.
- Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White.
- Peters was recruited fourth, meaning the order is: [1] Tao, [2], [3], [4] Peters, [5], [6], [7] White.

A: If Quinn was third, then Rovero would have to be second, violating the rule that Quinn was recruited before Rovero. Therefore, A is not possible.
B: If Rovero was fifth, then the order would have to be: [1] Tao, [2] Stanton, [3] Quinn, [4] Peters, [5] Rovero, [6] Villas, [7] White. This order satisfies all the given rules, so B is a possible order.
C: If Stanton was sixth, this would mean that Villas was recruited before White and would be in the fourth spot, creating a contradiction with the fact that Peters was recruited in the fourth spot. Therefore, C is not possible.
D: If Villas was sixth, this would mean that White was seventh, creating a contradiction with the fact that Peters was recruited in the fourth spot. Therefore, D is not possible.
E: If White was third, this would mean that the order was [1] Tao, [2] Stanton, [3] White, [4] Peters, [5] Quinn, [6] Villas, [7] Rovero. This violates the rule that Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, E is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time. 
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  
To find the correct answer, we need to determine the order in which the accomplices were recruited. We know that Tao was recruited second, and Peters was recruited fourth. Based on this information and the given constraints, we can deduce the following order:
  - Tao
  - Quinn
  - Rovero
  - Peters
  - Villas
  - White
  - Stanton
  
If this is the correct order, what could be true? 
  A: Quinn was recruited third. - True
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth. - False
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth. - False
  D: Villas was recruited sixth. - False
  E: White was recruited third. - False

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 or 3 days.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  We do not know what the specific targets are for any client yet.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, we know that Truvest's website target is 1 day, and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 or 3 days. 
Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target is 1 day, we know that Solide's website target can only be 2 or 3 days. Therefore, Solide's website target cannot be 1 day. 
Option D states that "Solide's website target is 2 days", which is possible based on the conditions given. Therefore, D is the correct answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Truvest has a website target and a voicemail target.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target:
- Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
- Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be 1 day.
- Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.
- None of the above statements lead to Image's website target being 2 days, so A) and B) are eliminated.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("D")

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means Truvest's website target is 1 day and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
As per the given conditions, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target and none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 2 days, and Solide's voicemail target must be 1 or 2 days.
It is not necessary to determine the exact voicemail target of Image. Therefore, we cannot deduce anything about Image's voicemail target based on the given information. However, Image's website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target, so Image's website target must be 1 or 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target is either 2 days or 1 day.
Thus, the only option that is consistent with these conditions is that Solide's website target is 2 days (Option D).
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- The company sets two service targets for each client, one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
    1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
    
Action: 
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 
- Therefore, the only possible answers are D and E. 
- However, we cannot determine which one is true based on the given information. 
- Thus, the answer is "None of the Above".
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has separate website and voicemail targets.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Since Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that its website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and its voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days. We know that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target can only be 1 day. This means that Truvest's website target must be 2 days, and its voicemail target must be 3 days. We also know that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target must be 2 days. Finally, since Solide's website target is 1 day, Truvest's website target is 2 days, and Image's voicemail target is 2 days, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("B") Image's website target is 2 days.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- There are six targets: two for each client (one for website, one for voicemail).
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("D")

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it cannot have a website target of 3 days because that would make the voicemail target even longer. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be either 1 or 2 days, and its voicemail target must be 2 or 3 days. 

If Solide's website target is longer than 2 days, then Truvest's website target (which must be shorter) cannot be 1 day, so Solide's website target must be 2 days. This means Truvest's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days.

This also means that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days, so it must be 1 day. Since none of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must also be 1 day. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 2 days. 

Thus, Solide's website target must be 2 days, which is choice D.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest's website target being shorter than its voicemail target means that Truvest's voicemail target should be longer than its website target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  A: This choice cannot be determined based on the given information. The length of Image's voicemail target is not related to Truvest's targets. 
  B: This choice cannot be determined based on the given information. The length of Image's website target is not related to Truvest's targets.
  C: This choice cannot be determined based on the given information. The length of Image's website target is not related to Truvest's targets.
  D: This choice contradicts established condition. It is stated that "Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target." 
  E: This choice establishes that Solide's website target is 1 day, which is the only option where Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Truvest has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail requests.
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is 1 day and its voicemail target is 2 days.
- Image has two targets, one for website and one for voicemail requests, and its voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- There are no limitations on the website targets being shorter than the voicemail targets.

Action: Answer("E")  
If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days. This means that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days, and the only option available is 1 day (due to the other targets being longer). Thus, Image's voicemail target is 1 day. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which is 1 day, so Solide's website target must also be 1 day. Therefore, the correct answer is E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company sets two service targets for each client: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - Targets can be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days. 
From the given conditions, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, if Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it must mean that Truvest's website target is 1 day and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days. 
This implies that Solide's website target must be 1 day, since it has to be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's voicemail target must be either 2 days or 3 days. 
From the given conditions, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day and its website target must be 2 days. 
Thus, Solide's website target is 2 days. Hence, the answer is D.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Truvest has two targets: a website target and a voicemail target.
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means the website target is either 1 or 2 days, and the voicemail target is either 2 or 3 days.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
Analysis:
  - Truvest's website target is either 1 or 2 days, which means its voicemail target is either 2 or 3 days.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Truvest's website target is shorter than or equal to its voicemail target.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. This means the shortest voicemail target should belong to Image. If Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, which is shorter. However, if Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target can be 1 day or 2 days.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The editor will edit 7 articles one at a time.
  - 3 articles cover finance (G, H, and J).
  - 3 articles cover nutrition (Q, R, and S).
  - The remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
  - The order in which the articles are edited is subject to some conditions:
    * Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
    * S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
    * S must be earlier than Y.
    * J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
    
If Y is fourth, then we can deduce the following order for the first four articles:
1. Either Q or R (because S cannot be earlier than Q if Q is not the third).
2. One of the finance articles (G, H, or J) that is not the one that comes after the one selected above in step 1.
3. The other article (finance or nutrition) that was not selected in step 1.
4. Y (because it is fourth).

We can conclude from the above information that:
- J cannot be second (because the article that precedes it must be G, which cannot be first).
- J must be third (because it must be earlier than G, which cannot be fourth).
- Q cannot be first (because it must be third if S is earlier than it).
- Q must be third (because if Q is not third, it cannot be earlier than S).
- R cannot be seventh (because it must be earlier than G, which cannot be seventh).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Seven articles are being edited one at a time and they are divided into two groups of three articles each, and one remaining article.
  The first article can be picked from any group of articles because there is no requirement that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  If S is before Q, then Q must be third. 
  S must be before Y.
  J must be before G, and G must be before R.
  If Y is fourth, then G, H, J, Q and S must be edited before Y. 
  Therefore, Y can only be first, second, third, fifth, sixth or seventh. 
  If Y is fourth, then the fourth article must be one of G, H, J, Q, or S.
  
Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, the fourth article must be one of G, H, J, Q, or S. 
  We cannot determine which of the five articles came fourth, so we must examine each choice to determine whether it must be true given the assumption that Y is fourth.

  A: J is second.
     If J is second and Y is fourth, then G is third. Then, Q and S must be first and fifth in some order. However, this creates two consecutive articles covering nutrition, which is not allowed. This choice is not possible.

  B: J is third
     If J is third and Y is fourth, then G must be second. Then, Q and S cannot be first or second nor can they be sixth or seventh since S comes before Y. Thus, Q and S can only be third, fourth, or fifth in some order. H must come before J, so H must be first and Q must be third. Thus, S is fifth. The remaining articles, R and Y, can only be sixth and seventh in some order. Thus, J is third is a possible order and this choice is correct.

  C: Q is first.
     If Q is first and Y is fourth, then S must be fifth. Then, G and J cannot be second nor can they be sixth or seventh since J must come before G. Thus, G and J can only be first, third, or fourth in some order. This creates at least one consecutive pair of articles covering finance, which is not allowed. This choice is not possible.

  D: Q is third
     If Q is third and Y is fourth, then S must be first. Then, either G or J must be second, but not both since they cover finance consecutively. Thus, the other finance article must be seventh. H must be fourth. Thus, R must be sixth and Y must be fifth. However, this creates two consecutive articles covering wildlife and it is not allowed. This choice is not possible.

  E: R is seventh.
     If R is seventh and Y is fourth, then G must be second and J must be third. H must be first and Q must be fifth with S coming earlier. However, there is no place for R between S and Y. This choice is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the articles to be edited is: [_,_,_,_,_,_,_]
  Three articles cover finance, and they are G, H, and J.
  Three articles cover nutrition, and they are Q, R, and S.
  One article, Y, covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles to be edited is: [_,_,_,Y,_,_,_].
  This means Q and S cannot be in the first two positions because S must be earlier than Q, and S must be earlier than Y.
  Q cannot be in the first position because S cannot be earlier than Q if Q is first.
  R cannot be in the seventh position because G must be earlier than R.
  
  A: We do not have enough information to determine if J is second or not.
  B: We do not have enough information to determine if J is third or not. 
  C: Q cannot be first because S cannot be earlier than Q if Q is first.
  D: If Q is third, then S can be earlier than Q, which is allowed. Therefore, Q must be third.
  E: We do not have enough information to determine if R is seventh or not.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles could be one of the following:
  1. Q, S, R, Y, G, H, J
  2. R, Q, S, Y, G, H, J
  3. Q, R, S, Y, G, H, J
  4. R, S, Q, Y, G, H, J
  5. Q, R, S, Y, J, G, H
  6. R, Q, S, Y, J, G, H
  7. Q, S, R, Y, J, G, H
  8. R, S, Q, Y, J, G, H
  A: J cannot be second because that would violate the condition that J is earlier than G and G is earlier than R.
  B: J cannot be third because that would violate the condition that J is earlier than G and G is earlier than R.
  C: Q cannot be first because that would violate the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  D: Q can only be third in orders (1), (3), and (7), which means that S is second. However, we know that S must be earlier than Y, which means that Q cannot be third if Y is fourth. Therefore, Q cannot be third and this choice is not true.
  E: R can only be seventh in orders (2), (4), and (8), which means that G is fifth. However, this violates the condition that J is earlier than G and G is earlier than R. Therefore, R cannot be seventh and this choice is not true.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the articles is constrained by the conditions below:
  1- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  2- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  3- S must be earlier than Y.
  4- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fourth, we can deduce that the order of the first three articles must be either GHS or HGS because J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Then, Q cannot be first, and S must be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Hence, the possible orderings are: GHSQRY, HGSQRY, GHYRSQ, and HGYRSQ.
  
A: J cannot be second because the first two articles must be either GHS or HGS.
B: J can only be third in the sequence HGSQRY.
C: Q cannot be first because S must be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
D: Q can only be third in the sequence HGSQRY.
E: We cannot determine if R is seventh or not.

Action: Answer("B") 
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The articles can be edited in the following order: G, H, J, Q, R, S, Y
  The articles on finance are: G, H, and J
  The articles on nutrition are: Q, R, and S
  Conditions:
    - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
    - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
    - S must be earlier than Y.
    - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
  A: J is second. (wrong because J must be earlier than G)
  B: J is third (wrong because J must be earlier than G)
  C: Q is first. (wrong because Q cannot be first because S must be earlier than Y)
  D: Q is third (correct because S must be earlier than Q and S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third, and Y is fourth)
  E: R is seventh. (wrong because J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, but if R is seventh, J and G must be after it) 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We have seven articles, G, H, J cover finance, Q, R, S cover nutrition and Y covers wildlife.
  If S is before Q, then Q must be third.
  S is before Y.
  J is before G, and G is before R.
  We need to determine which statement can be inferred if Y is fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If Y is fourth, we have two scenarios.
  1. The first three articles cannot be S, Q, and any Wildlife because if S is before Q, then Q must be third and S must be before Y.
  2. The first three articles cannot be Y, any nutrition, and any finance because S must be earlier than Y and consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  We also know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  Using the above rules, we can eliminate some of the statements:
  A: J is second. (J cannot be second because Y is fourth)
  C: Q is first. (Q cannot be the first as per the above analysis)
  E: R is seventh. (R cannot be seventh as per the above analysis)
  We are left with two statements:
  B: J is third
  D: Q is third
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The articles are labeled G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance.
  Three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition.
  The remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

If Y is fourth, then S must be first or second and Q must be third. Because S and Q must cover nutrition and be consecutive, R must be fourth or fifth. J must be earlier than G, making H and Y the only articles that can be sixth and seventh, and H must cover finance. So the order of the articles is one of the following:
SQRGJHY
QSRRGJHY
If the order is SQRGJHY, then J is second, and if the order is QSRRGJHY, then J is third. Therefore, either J is second or J is third.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B") are both correct answers. 
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are three finance articles (G, H, and J).
  - There are three nutrition articles (Q, R, and S).
  - The remaining article (Y) covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, the order of the articles being edited could be: Q, R, S, Y, G, H, J
  
  A: J cannot be second because G must be earlier than R, and G must be later than J. 
  B: If J is third, then the order of the articles being edited could be: Q, R, S, J, Y, G, H. This satisfies all of the conditions.
  C: Q cannot be first because S must be earlier than Y and cannot be the first article.
  D: If Q is third, then the order of the articles being edited could be: S, R, Q, Y, G, H, J. This satisfies all of the conditions.
  E: R cannot be seventh because G must be earlier than R, and G cannot be the last article.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The articles can be sorted in the following way: Q, R, S, G, H, J, Y
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If Y is fourth, the order will be Q, R, S, Y, _, _, _.
    J must be earlier than G, so J cannot be second. If J is third, then G must be fourth, and H and J cannot be included. If Q is first, then S must be second and Y must be third, and there will be no place for R. Therefore, Q must be first, R must be fifth, G must be sixth, and H must be seventh.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?
Choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
  C: the western, the horror film
  D: the western, the mystery
  E: the western, the sci-fi film
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are 5 movies, and exactly one will be shown at 8PM on screen 3. The other 4 movies will be shown on screens 1 and 2, with two movies each, starting 7 PM and 9 PM.
  The Western will begin before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  From the conditions, we know that the Western must be shown before the horror film. Therefore any answer that does not have this ordering is incorrect. 
  A and B are possible, as they both satisfy the Western before the horror film condition; 
  C and D are possible as long as screen 2 shows the Romance and the mystery, and screen 1 shows the Western and the Horror film; 
  Answer E is impossible as the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The western film begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  
Elimination:
  A, B, and D show that the mystery film is on screen 1 with either sci-fi or horror films. But we know that the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Hence, we can eliminate these choices.
  C shows that the western and the horror film are on screen 1. This satisfies the condition mentioned that the western film begins before the horror film.
  E shows that the western and the sci-fi film are on screen 1. This is possible as we are not aware of any restrictions and the remaining films can be on the screen 2 and 3.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The horror film starts after a western on some screen.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screen 1 and Screen 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; 
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
Analysis: 
  According to the given conditions, Screen 1 shows two movies with the 7 P.M. movie followed by a 9 P.M. movie. The horror film and mystery are on different screens, and as there are three screens, one of them must show the Western. Since the Western is before the Horror movie, it cannot be shown on Screen 2 since the Romance movie cannot be shown on Screen 2. The Sci-Fi movie cannot be shown on Screen 3. So the Sci-fi movie must be on either Screen 1 or Screen 2 since it cannot be on Screen 3. 
  A: The horror film comes after the Western, which means the Western has to be shown before both movies. Therefore, this option is valid.
  B: The horror film and the mystery are on different screens, but the Sci-Fi movie cannot be shown on Screen 3. Therefore, this option is valid.
  C: This option is valid because the Western movie can be shown on Screen 1 or on Screen 2 as the first movie and the Horror movie on Screen 1 as the second movie.
  D: This option is valid because Western movie must be shown before the Horror movie so Western movie can be shown on Screen 1 or on Screen 2 as the first movie and the Mystery movie on Screen 2 as the second movie.
  E: This option is not valid, as the Sci-Fi movie cannot be shown on Screen 3 and since Western movie must be shown before the Horror movie, the Western movie should be on Screen 1 or Screen 2 with the Horror movie as the second movie. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. 
  Screen 1 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: 
  Since the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3 and the romance cannot be shown on screen 2, the sci-fi film and the romance must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2. Since the western begins before the horror film, the only possible way to arrange the movies on screen 1 is to show the western before the other movie. Thus, the only accurate lists of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 are: the western, the mystery and the romance, the horror film. Thus, 'the western, the sci-fi film' cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The horror film begins after the western film.
  The sci-fi film is not on screen 3.
  The romance is not on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
A: The sci-fi film, the horror film, cannot be correct because the western must begin before the horror film. 
B: The sci-fi film is not on screen 3 and the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, it's possible that the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1 and the mystery is shown on screen 2. 
C: The horror film begins after the western film. It's possible that the western is shown first on screen 1 then the horror film is shown second on screen 2. 
D: The mystery and the horror film are shown on different screens. Therefore, it's possible that the western is shown first on screen 1 and then the mystery is shown second on screen 2. 
E: The horror film is not shown on screen 1. Therefore, the western film cannot be followed by the horror film on the same screen. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find out the movie combination that cannot be shown on screen 1. We know that screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  A: The sci-fi film can't be shown on screen1 as it is not shown on screen 3. So, this combination cannot be accurate.
  B: The sci-fi film can be shown on screen 2 and the mystery on screen 1. So, this can be an accurate combination.
  C: The western may be shown on screen 1 or 2. If it is shown on screen 1, then the horror film can't be shown on screen1 as it begins after the western. But if it is shown on screen 2, then it can be an accurate combination. So, this option is also possibly an accurate option.
  D: The western can be shown on screen 1 and the mystery on screen 2. So, this can be an accurate combination.
  E: The western can be shown on screen 1, but the sci-fi film can't be shown on screen1 as it is not shown on screen 3. So, this combination cannot be accurate.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screen 1 has two movies, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be on screen 1. If the mystery is on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the horror film would be shown on screen 2 (the only other option), but the romance cannot be shown on screen 2. Therefore, "the sci-fi film, the mystery" CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- There are five movies showing: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
- Screen 3 shows one movie at 8 PM.
- Screens 1 and 2 each show two movies.
- Screen 1 shows movies at 7 PM and 9 PM.
- Screen 2 shows movies at 7 PM and 9 PM.
- The western starts before the horror film.
- The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
- The romance is not shown on screen 2.
- The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
- Since Screen 1 shows movies at 7 PM and 9 PM, it can't have the 8 PM movie.
- Thus, the horror and mystery can't be both on Screen 1.
- The romance can't be on Screen 2.
- The western starts before the horror film.
- The sci-fi film can't be shown on Screen 3.
- Using the given rules, we can check each option to see which one is not possible.

Option A: The sci-fi film, the horror film
- This is possible: the sci-fi film can be shown on Screen 2 at 9 PM, and the horror film can be shown on Screen 1 at 7 PM.

Option B: The sci-fi film, the mystery
- This is possible: the sci-fi film can be shown on Screen 2 at 9 PM, and the mystery can be shown on Screen 1 at 7 PM.

Option C: The western, the horror film
- This is possible: the western can be shown on Screen 1 at 7 PM, and the horror film can be shown on Screen 2 at 9 PM.

Option D: The western, the mystery
- This is possible: the western can be shown on Screen 1 at 7 PM, and the mystery can be shown on Screen 2 at 9 PM.

Option E: The western, the sci-fi film
- This is NOT possible: the western must start before the horror film, and the sci-fi film can't be shown on Screen 3. Therefore, the western can't be shown on Screen 3 and the sci-fi film can't be shown on Screen 1, which means they can't be both on Screen 1.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. The horror film begins after the western.
  2. The sci-fi is not shown on screen 3.
  3. The romance is not on screen 2.
  4. The horror and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each.
  6. Screen 3 shows exactly one movie.

Let's check which options are feasible:

A) The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1 because it is not shown on screen 3. Therefore, this option cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.

B) This option is feasible because the sci-fi film can be shown on screen 1 at 7 p.m. and the mystery on screen 2 at 7 p.m.

C) This option is also feasible because the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 p.m. and the horror film can be shown on screen 2 at 7 p.m.

D) This option is feasible because the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 p.m. and the mystery can be shown on screen 2 at 7 p.m.

E) This option is feasible because the western can be shown on screen 1 at 7 p.m. and the sci-fi can be shown on screen 2 at 7 p.m.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does. Therefore, the horror film cannot be scheduled before the western film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.

A: the sci-fi film, the horror film -> The horror film cannot be shown before the western film.
B: the sci-fi film, the mystery -> Possible because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
C: the western, the horror film -> Possible because the horror film can be shown after the western film.
D: the western, the mystery -> Possible because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
E: the western, the sci-fi film -> The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1 because screen 1 shows a movie at 7 P.M. and another at 9 P.M., and the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  - If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then (according to the first condition) neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 1. Also, from the last condition, there must be more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so only one sales representative can work in Zone 1. Therefore, A must be false.
  - If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, it would still be possible to satisfy all the given conditions: both Parra and Tiao would work in Zone 1, Udall would work in Zone 2, and the other three representatives would work in Zone 3. So, B is not necessarily false.
  - If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then (according to the last condition) there must be at least four representatives working in Zone 3, which would mean only one representative can work in each of Zone 1 and Zone 2. However, Parra and Quinn must work in the same zone as each other, so the conditions cannot be satisfied. Therefore, C must be false.
  - If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, it is still possible to satisfy all the given conditions: Parra and Tiao work in Zone 1, Tiao and Udall (the only two sales representatives left) work in Zone 2, and the other three representatives work in Zone 3. So, D is not necessarily false.
  - If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then (according to the first condition) neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 1, and (according to the last condition) there must be more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which would mean there is only one representative in Zone 2. However, Tiao and Udall cannot both work in Zone 2 because of the second condition. Therefore, E must be false.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives and 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  From given conditions, it can be inferred that:
    - Zone 1 includes either Parra or Tiao (but not both).
    - Zone 2 includes either Tiao or Udall (but not both).
    - Either Parra, Quinn, or both work in the same zone as Zone 1.
    - Either Stuckey, Udall, or both work in the same zone as Zone 2.
    - The remaining sales representatives not mentioned in the previous points would work in Zone 3.
  Using this information, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
    - Kim cannot be in Zone 1 because Parra or Tiao must be in that zone. Therefore, A is true.
    - Kim cannot be in Zone 3 because there must be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, B is false.
    - Mahr cannot be in the same zone as Stuckey because they already accounted for all sales representatives in Zone 2. Therefore, C is true.
    - Udall cannot be in the same zone as Mahr because they already accounted for all sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, D is true.
    - Parra cannot be in Zone 1 with Stuckey because Quinn must also be in that zone, but he cannot also be in Zone 3 with Stuckey. Therefore, E is false.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs seven sales representatives to work in its three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
 
Solution:
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in the same zone, they cannot both work in Zone 1. Hence, Option A is True.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in the same zone, they can both work in Zone 3. Hence, Option B is True.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in the same zone, they can both work in Zone 3. Hence, Option C is True.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, it satisfies all conditions. Hence, Option D is True.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in the same zone, they cannot both work in Zone 1. Hence, Option E is FALSE.
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives, Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are 3 sales zones, Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  From the initial conditions,
  Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  The following conclusions can be drawn:
  1. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3. Therefore, Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Quinn work in Zone 3. This means that options A and E are false.
  2. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3. Therefore, Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Quinn work in Zone 3. This means that options A and E are false.
  3. If Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao works in Zone 1 and Parra works in Zone 3. Therefore, Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Quinn work in Zone 3. This means that options A and E are false.
  4. If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall works in Zone 3 and either Parra or Kim work in Zone 1. Therefore, there are at least four sales representatives working in Zone 3. This means that option B is false and other options are still valid.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs seven sales representatives that works in its three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representative working in Zone 3 than Zone 2.
  
Solution: 
  Looking at choice A, there is no indication in the conditions that Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. 
  Thus, Choice A is False. 
  
  Looking at choice B, there is a possibility that Kim and Stuckey could both work in Zone 3. Thus, choice B could be True.
  
  Looking at choice C, there is a possibility that Mahr and Stuckey could both work in Zone 3. Thus, choice C could be True. 
   
  Looking at choice D, there is a possibility that Mahr and Udall could both work in Zone 3. Thus, choice D could be True.

  Looking at choice E, Parra cannot work in Zone I because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Thus, choice E is False.
  
Therefore, the answer is either A or E. However, since the question asks which one of the following must be false, the answer is: Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 3 sales zones and 7 sales representatives; therefore, at least 1 zone must have more than 2 sales representatives and at least 1 zone must have less than 3 sales representatives.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To determine which statement is false, we can use the process of elimination:
- Option A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1: This is possible since there are at least 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1.
- Option B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3: This is possible since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Option C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3: This is possible since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Option D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3: This is possible since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and Stuckey is already assigned to a zone with Udall, so Mahr can be assigned to Zone 3.
- Option E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1: This is not possible because either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The seven sales representatives have to be assigned to three different sales zones with the given conditions.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: Since either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, it is not possible for both Kim and Stuckey to work in the same zone. Therefore, the statement in A that "Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1" must be false.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 sales representatives - Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  They work in 3 sales zones - Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
A: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then Parra or Tiao would have to work in Zone 2, but both Parra and Tiao cannot work in the same zone. So this must be false.
B: This is possible, as there are more sales representatives in Zone 3. This could also mean that one of Kim or Stuckey is in Zone 3 while the other is not.
C: This is possible, as there are more sales representatives in Zone 3. This could also mean that Mahr is the only sales representative in Zone 2.
D: This is possible, as there are more sales representatives in Zone 3. This could also mean that Udall is the only sales representative in Zone 2.
E: If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then Quinn would also have to work in Zone 1, but there cannot be 3 sales representatives in one zone because there are not enough sales representatives to do so. So this must be false.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (not stated in the conditions)
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (not stated in the conditions)
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (Possible, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2)
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. (Possible, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2)
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (not possible since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone and Parra is stated to work in Zone 1, so Quinn should be in Zone 1 as well. Also, Stuckey and Udall are together in the same sales zone, and Udall cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore Stuckey cannot work in Zone 1 with Parra.) 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
    The software company employs seven sales representatives and assign them to its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
    Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
    Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
    Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
    Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
    There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
    If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then one of Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 3. However, this contradicts the given that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, (A) must be false.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly seven consecutive days and each day has one breed of kitten and one breed of puppy featured.
  - There are three breeds of kitten: Himalayan, Manx, and Siamese.
  - There are three breeds of puppy: Greyhound, Newfoundland, and Rottweiler.
  - Greyhounds is featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Solution:
  - From the conditions, we know that:
    - Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so there are 6 remaining days.
    - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, so Greyhounds are not featured on day 7.
    - From "Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1", we know that Himalayans can be featured only on days 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    - From "Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans", we know that Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, and on the days when Himalayans are featured.
  - Based on the above conditions, option B, C, and E can't be true because Himalayans and Greyhounds are not featured on all the same days, and Rottweilers are not featured on all the same days Himalayans are not.
  - Option A is not possible because there are only three breeds of kitten and puppy, and each breed must be featured on exactly one day out of seven.
  - Thus, the answer is Option D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Seven consecutive days, starts with day 1 and ends with day 7.
- Three breeds of kittens: Himalayan, Manx, Siamese.
- Three breeds of puppies: Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler.
- Each breed of kitten or puppy is featured once and only once on a day.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Breed on day 1 is not on day 7.
- Himalayan featured on exactly 3 days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers not featured on day 7 or with Himalayans.

Elimination:
- A: There are 6 different breeds. It's impossible for 4 of them to be featured for 3 days and the other 2 for just a single day without breaking the rule that each breed is featured exactly once.
- B: The only breeds featured on the same day with Himalayans are Manx and Siamese, therefore it's impossible for Greyhounds to be featured with Himalayans on the same day.
- C: Himalayans are featured on 3 separate days. Greyhounds are featured only once, therefore it's impossible for Himalayans to be featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
- D: Rottweilers are not featured on days with Himalayans, therefore it's impossible for Himalayans to be featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
- E: It's possible that Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, as long as they are not featured on the same day with Himalayans.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  On each of exactly seven consecutive days, a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. 
  The following conditions must apply:
    Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
    No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
    Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
    Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
    Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If four breeds are each featured on three days, then there are only two days left for the last breed to be featured. This choice does not satisfy the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: If Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, then there are only two days left for them to be featured along with Greyhounds. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
C: If Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, then there is only one day left for them to be featured along with Greyhounds. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
D: If Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, then there is only one day left for them to be featured. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
E: If Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, then there are only three days left for Rottweilers to be featured. Therefore, this choice can be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  We need 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies to feature on days 1 to 7.
  The breed of puppies that feature on Day 1 is Greyhound.
  No breed can be featured on two consecutive days.
  Himalayans are not featured on Day 1 and are featured on exactly 3 days.
  Rottweilers are not featured on Day 7 and are not to be featured on any day that Himalayans are.
  
A: This cannot be true because only 3 breeds of each animal can be featured and Himalayans can only be featured for 3 days.
B: Himalayans are not featured on Day 1, so this cannot be true.
C: This cannot be true because Himalayans are only featured for 3 days and Greyhounds are featured on Day 1.
D: This could be true. If Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6, and Rottweilers are not featured on these days, then this statement holds true.
E: This cannot be true because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Seven consecutive days (day 1 through day 7)
- Three breeds of kitten (Himalayan, Manx, Siamese)
- Three breeds of puppy (Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler)
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days
- Himalayans are not featured on day 1
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7
- Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans

A: If four breeds are each featured on three days, that would give us 12 days, which is not possible as we only have 7 days.
B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, Himalayans would need to be featured on day 1 which is not allowed. 
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, that would mean Himalayans would need to be featured on day 1 and on every day that Greyhounds are not, which again is not allowed.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, that would be possible since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, this could be possible, as long as Rottweilers are not featured on day 7.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 consecutive days, and each day features one breed of kitten and one breed of puppy.
  There are 3 breeds of kitten (Himalayan, Manx, Siamese) and 3 breeds of puppy (Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler).
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analyzing the choices:
  A: This is unlikely to be true since each breed of kitten and puppy is featured once on each day, so it is not possible for four breeds to be featured on three days.
  B: According to the given conditions, Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so this statement cannot be true.
  C: According to the given conditions, Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so this statement cannot be true.
  D: If Himalayans are not featured on any day that features Rottweilers, then it follows that Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. This is a possible scenario according to the given conditions.
  E: This is unlikely to be true since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, but there are only 3 days that feature Himalayans.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly seven consecutive days.
  - There are exactly three breeds of kittens (Himalayan, Manx, Siamese).
  - There are exactly three breeds of puppies (Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler).
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Choice A: There are only three breeds of kittens and three breeds of puppies, each breed must appear at least once, so it is not possible for exactly four breeds to be featured for three days.
- Choice B: Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, hence they cannot be featured on every day that Greyhounds are. Also, there is no guarantee that Himalayans and Greyhounds will be featured on the same days.
- Choice C: This option cannot be true. The only breed that is featured on day 1 is Greyhound, so Himalayans cannot be featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
- Choice D: This option could be true. Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, and Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, then Rottweilers could be featured on the other four days (excluding day 1, day 7, and the three days that feature Himalayans).
- Choice E: This option cannot be true because Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, and it is not guaranteed that Himalayans will be featured on all days that Rottweilers are not featured.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- There are three breeds of kitten: Himalayan, Manx, and Siamese.
- There are three breeds of puppy: Greyhound, Newfoundland, and Rottweiler.
- The schedule is such that on each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 through day 7), exactly one breed of kitten and one breed of puppy are featured.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.

- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then one breed would have to be featured on two consecutive days, which is not possible due to the given conditions. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans would have to be featured on day 1, which is not possible due to the given conditions. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans would have to be featured on day 1, which is not possible due to the given conditions. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans would have to be featured on day 7, which is not possible due to the given conditions. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers would have to be featured on days 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. This is possible under the given conditions, as long as Himalayans are featured on days 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, the answer is Answer("E").
Response 8:

  The schedule consists of exactly seven consecutive days.
  There are three breeds of kittens - Himalayan, Manx, Siamese.
  There are three breeds of puppies - Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler.
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  There are no consecutive days that share the same breed.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  No breed featured on day 1 is featured on day 7.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor any day that features Himalayans.
A: If there were exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, this would not fulfill the given conditions (Himalayans must be featured on exactly three days).
B: This cannot be true because Greyhounds are only featured on one day.
C: This cannot be true because Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but Greyhounds are only featured on one day.
D: This could be true. If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then on days 2 through 4, the featured breeds must be Himalayans, Newfoundland, and Siamese (in any order). On days 5 through 7, the featured breeds must be Manx, Greyhound, and Rottweiler (in any order). This satisfies all of the given conditions.
E: This cannot be true because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:

  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
Solution:
  - If Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, then they cannot be featured on day 7, nor on day 1. 
  - If Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, and they cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, then they must be featured on days 2-4-6.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1, and they cannot be featured on any consecutive day or day 7. Therefore, they must be featured on days 1, 3, 5.
  - Moreover, we know that every breed is featured three times. So, we can determine the breeds that are featured on days 2, 4, and 6:
      * Day 2: Himalayan and Newfoundland
      * Day 4: Siamese and Greyhound
      * Day 6: Manx and Rottweiler
  
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days. - False, each breed is featured three times.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are. - False, Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are. - False, Himalayans are not featured on day 1 and are not featured on the same days as Greyhounds.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. - True, Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6, the days where Rottweilers are not featured.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not. - False, Rottweilers are not featured on day 1, and they are featured on days where Himalayans are not present (days 2, 4, and 6).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has 3 clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client (one for requests through the website and one for requests through voicemail) with values of 3, 2, or 1 day.
  - There are six targets in total, subject to the following conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Truvest's voicemail target cannot be 3 days. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 1 day or 2 days. However, since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target cannot be 3 days either. Therefore, Solide's website can either be 1 day or 2 days. Since Solide's voicemail target cannot be longer than its website target, Solide's voicemail target is also 1 day or 2 days. Based on this, Image's website target must be 1 day, and since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target must be less than or equal to 1 day. This means Image's voicemail target can be 1 day but not 2 days. Therefore, only option A is false, and it must be "None of the clients' website target is 1 day."
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- There are two targets for each client: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
- The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("E")
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Solide and Truvest both have a voicemail target of 1 or 2 days. However, we do not have information to determine the specific voicemail target of Truvest. Therefore, it is possible that Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, making choice E false. Thus, the answer is E.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The service targets are for three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client.
  The targets are set according to three conditions:
    1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, that means the longest voicemail target is 2 days.

Analysis:
  A: If Image's website target is 1 day, then it is shorter than either of the 2-day voicemail targets, satisfying the first condition. Therefore, A could be true.
  B: If Solide's website target is 2 days, then it is not longer than Truvest's website target, satisfying the third condition. Therefore, B could be true.
  C: If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, then it is the same as the longest voicemail target, which violates the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, C must be false.
  D: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then it is not shorter than Solide's website target, violating the third condition. Therefore, D must be false.
  E: If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then it is the same as the longest voicemail target, which violates the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, E must be false.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Solution:
- If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each client's voicemail target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
- Image has the shortest voicemail target. Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 1 day.
- Solide's voicemail target cannot be 3 days. Therefore, Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
- Truvest's voicemail target cannot be 3 days. Therefore, Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days and Truvest's website target is 1 day.
- Image's website target is determined by the fact that none of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Image's website target is 1 day.
- Thus, all the options A, B, C, D, and E are true and the answer is None of the above. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- There are two service targets for each client: one for website requests, and one for voicemail requests.
- The service targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- The following conditions apply:
  * None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  * Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  * Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A") 

If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then it means that the voicemail targets are either 1 day or 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, and the voicemail targets of Solide and Truvest must be 2 days.

From the conditions, we know that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Since Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, its website target cannot be 3 days, so it must be 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target must also be 2 days. This means that Solide's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days.

Thus, the only statement that does not necessarily have to be true is A: Image's website target is 1 day. While it is possible for Image's website target to be 1 day, it could also be 2 days, depending on the targets of the other clients.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
   * None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
   * Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
   * Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")
Reasoning: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, and its website target cannot be longer than the voicemail target. Hence, Image's website target must be 1 day. 
  Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target, Solide's website target must be 2 days. And, since none of the clients can have a voicemail target of 3 days, then Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days. 
  Finally, Truvest's website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target, and its voicemail target cannot be 3 days. Therefore, both Truvest's website and voicemail targets must be 2 days. 
  Thus, the only statement that contradicts the conditions is that Image's website target is 1 day (choice A), which does not necessarily have to be true.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the maximum permitted voicemail target is 2 days. 
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
A: Image's website target is 1 day is possible given the above conditions because Image's voicemail target could be 2 days, which would allow its website target to be 1 day.
B: Solide's website target is 2 days is possible given the above conditions because Truvest could have a website target of 3 days and still satisfy the conditions.
C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days is possible because any of the clients could have a voicemail target of 2 days given the above conditions.
D: Truvest's website target is 2 days could be true because Truvest's website target must be longer than Solide's website target, which could be 1 day.
E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days could be true because any of the clients could have a voicemail target of 2 days given the above conditions.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- Two service targets are set for each client.
- The service targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, it means that the voicemail target for each client is either 2 days or 1 day. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. 
If Solide's website target is 2 days, Truvest's website target must be 1 day because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's voicemail target cannot be 2 days. This means that the statement in choice E is also true. 
Both choices B and C are true based on the given conditions. 
Thus, the only option left is A, which means that it is the answer.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The clients are Image, Solide, and Truvest
  - Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail
  - The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target
  - None of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days

Analysis:
  - If Solide's voicemail target is 3 days, then Solide's website target must also be 3 days because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. But this contradicts with the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Thus, Solide's voicemail target must be shorter than 3 days, meaning the correct answer is not C or E.
  - If Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days, then Truvest's website target must also be 3 days. This contradicts the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target since Solide's website target would also be shorter than 3 days, making it shorter than Truvest's website target which is impossible. Therefore, Truvest's voicemail target must be shorter than 3 days, meaning the correct answer is not D.
  - If Image's voicemail target is 3 days, then both of Image's targets would be 3 days which is not possible since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Thus, the Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 3 days or 2 days. But since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. This means that Image's website target must also be 1 day since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, the answer is not A. 
Conclusion: 
  The answer is B because Solide's website target being 2 days must be true based on the conditions given and the analysis above.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  4. No client has a voicemail target of 3 days.

Based on condition (4), Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days. Therefore, Image's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days according to condition (1). 

If Image's voicemail target is 1 day and Image's website target is also 1 day, then Solide's website target must be shorter than 1 day according to condition (3), which is not possible since the minimum target is 1 day. Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 2 days and Image's website target is 1 day. 

According to condition (2), Solide's voicemail target is 3 days and Solide's website target is 2 days. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be longer than 2 days according to condition (3). Since no client has a voicemail target of 3 days, Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days according to condition (1).

Based on the above analysis, the only statement that is not necessarily true is statement (D) "Truvest's website target is 2 days." Therefore, the answer is:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are a total of six photographs: Two in the Lifestyle section, two in the Metro section, and two in the Sports section
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue
  - Fuentes must have at least one photo in the Sports section
  - Hue must have the same number of photos in the Lifestyle section as Fuentes has in the Sports section
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section
  - One Lifestyle photo is by Fuentes, and one is by Hue
  
Action: 
  Based on the conditions, we know that Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Sports section, and since one Lifestyle photograph is by Fuentes, that means the other photograph in Sports section cannot be by Fuentes. Therefore, the other photo in the Sports section must be by Hue, since Fuentes and Hue must have the same number of photographs in their respective sections. This eliminates choices A and B. 
  Additionally, since one Lifestyle photograph is by Fuentes and one in the Metro section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, that means the other Metro photo must be by Gagnon. This eliminates choice C. 
  This leaves us with choices D and E. However, since we know that Hue already has one photo in the Lifestyle section, and one photo in the Sports section, they cannot have both photos in the Sports section. Therefore, the answer is 
  Answer("E") -- Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1) Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  2) Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  3) For each photographer, there should be at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs.
  4) At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  5) The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  6) None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue:
    - At least one photograph in the Metro section is also by Fuentes or Hue.
    - The other photograph in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon.
    - The number of Hue’s photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes’ photographs in the Sports section.
    - Any combination of photographs is possible for the Sports section.
    
Analysis:
  A: It is possible, if the other photograph in the Metro section is by Hue and there are two photographs by Fuentes in the Sports section.
  B: Not possible since at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
  C: It is possible, if the other photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and there is only one photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section.
  D: It is not necessarily true since the number of Hue’s photographs in the Sports section can vary.
  E: It is possible, since the combination of photographs in the Sports section can be any.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  * There are 6 photographs: 2 in Lifestyle, 2 in Metro, and 2 in Sports
  * The photographers are Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue
  * Each photographer can have 1 to 3 photographs in total
  * No Gagnon's photographs can appear in Sports
  * In Lifestyle, there must be at least one photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro
  * The number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle must be equal to Fuentes's photos in Sports
  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, the following must be true:
* The remaining photograph in Lifestyle is taken by Gagnon
* At least one photograph in Metro is taken by Fuentes or Hue
* The remaining photograph in Metro is taken by the third photographer
* One of the Sports photographs must be taken by Hue and the other one by the third photographer (not Gagnon)

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. - This is not possible because one photograph in Lifestyle must be by a different photographer who also has a photo in Metro.
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - This is not possible because one photograph in Lifestyle must be by a different photographer who also has a photo in Metro.
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. - This is possible since one photograph in Lifestyle is by Fuentes and the other by Hue. The remaining Metro photograph must be taken by the third photographer (not Fuentes or Hue).
D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - This is not possible since Hue can only have the same number of photographs in Lifestyle and Sports. If one is in Lifestyle, then only one can be in Sports.
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - This is not possible since one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  There are 6 photographs that need to be placed in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections, with 2 photos per section.
  For each photographer, there must be at least one but no more than three of their photographs.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - Fuentes has a photograph in the Lifestyle section and a photograph in the Sports section.
  - Hue has a photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - Gagnon has no photograph in the Lifestyle section and no photograph in the Sports section.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. 
     This is not possible because at least one of the photographs in the Metro section must be by a photographer other than Fuentes.
     
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. 
     This is not possible because Gagnon has no photograph in the Lifestyle or Sports sections.
     
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. 
     This is possible. Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, so the other photograph must be in the Metro section.
     
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. 
     This is not possible because Fuentes has a photograph in the Sports section.
     
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
     This is not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  We know that there are 3 photographers - Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  There are 6 different photos - exactly 2 in each of the 3 sections - Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photos must appear, meaning that each photographer has between 1-3 photos.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photo in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' in the Sports section.
  Gagnon cannot have any photos in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  If there is one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes and one by Hue, it means that there must be at least one photograph in the Metro section by either Fuentes or Hue. It cannot be Gagnon because if there is any photograph by Gagnon in the Metro section, then none of his photos can be in the Sports section. 
  There are two photos each in the Lifestyle and Metro sections, so the remaining 2 photos in the Metro section must be by Gagnon. This means that exactly one photo in the Metro section is by Hue.
  The number of photos by Fuentes and Hue in Lifestyle and Sports sections respectively could be 1 each, or it could be 2 each. This satisfies the given constraints.
  The remaining option D cannot be true as it violates the constraint that Hue cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the answer is C.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Total of 6 photographs, exactly 2 per section, 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  2. For each photographer, at least 1 but no more than 3 photographs must appear.
  3. At least one Lifestyle photograph by a photographer with at least 1 photograph in the Metro section.
  4. The number of Hue's Lifestyle photos is the same as Fuentes' Sports photos.
  5. Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then Fuentes needs to have at least one photograph in the Metro section, according to condition 3. That leaves only one photograph available for Fuentes outside of the Lifestyle and Metro sections. That photo would have to be in the Sports section, according to condition 4. Since Fuentes has one photo in the Sports section, it must be true that Hue also has one photo in the Sports section in order to satisfy condition 4. Gagnon cannot have any photos in the Sports section, according to condition 5. Thus, only C could be true, which says exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - A total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that the other two Lifestyle photographs must be by Gagnon, because each photographer must have at least one photo in each section and Gagnon's photos cannot be in the Sports section. Therefore, Gagnon must have two photos in the Lifestyle section and one each in the Metro and Sports sections, leaving only one photo each for Hue and Fuentes in the Metro and Sports sections.
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes because Fuentes already has a photo in the Lifestyle section. Incorrect.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon because Gagnon already has a photo in the Lifestyle section and one in the Sports section. Incorrect.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section must be by Hue, leaving the other photo to be by Fuentes. This is possible because each photographer must have at least one photo in the Metro section. Correct.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section must be by Gagnon and Fuentes, because Gagnon cannot have photos in the Sports section. Incorrect.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section can be by Hue because Fuentes must have the same number of photos in the Sports section as Hue has in the Lifestyle section. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  * Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section
  * Three photographers are available: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue
  * For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  * At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  * The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  * None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it follows that:
  * The remaining photograph for the Lifestyle section must be taken by either Gagnon, Fuentes, or Hue.
  * At least one photograph in the Metro section is by either Fuentes or Hue.
  * The remaining photograph for the Metro section must be taken by either Gagnon, Fuentes, or Hue.
  * The number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section.

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This is not possible because at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section, and in this scenario, the photographers for the Lifestyle section are Fuentes and Hue.

B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. This is not possible because at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.

C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This is possible. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, the remaining photograph for the Lifestyle section must be taken by either Gagnon, Fuentes, or Hue. If at least one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, then the remaining photograph for the Metro section must be taken by either Gagnon or Fuentes. In this scenario, one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, and the other is by either Gagnon or Fuentes.

D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This is not possible because the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section, and in this scenario, there is only one photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section.

E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. This is not possible because the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section.

Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs will be featured, two per section in three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - The photographers who took the photos are Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - The following conditions apply:
    - Each photographer's photos are featured at between 1 and 3 times.
    - At least one photographer who has a photo in the Metro section must also have a photo in the Lifestyle section.
    - The number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be equal to the number of Fuentes's photos in the Sports section.
    - None of Gagnon's photos can be in the Sports section.
  
  We know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. We need to determine which of the given options could be true based on the constraints provided.

Eliminating the impossible:
- We know that Fuentes has a photograph in the Lifestyle section. Since at least one photographer needs to have a photo in both the Lifestyle and Metro sections, it has to be either Fuentes or Hue. If it were Hue, then both of Hue's photographs would be used up and Fuentes would have no photographs left to put in the Sports section. Therefore, Fuentes must also have a photo in Metro section.
- We know that Gagnon cannot have a photograph in the Sports section.

Possible solutions:
- A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes: This is possible. We know that Fuentes has a photo in the Lifestyle section, and we determined earlier that Fuentes must also have a photo in the Metro section. Therefore, one of the Metro photographs must be by Fuentes, and the other Metro photograph could be by any of the three photographers.
- B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon: This is not possible because Gagnon cannot have photographs in the Sports section and we have already placed all of the other photographs.
- C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue: This is possible. We know that one of the photographs in the Lifestyle section is by Hue, and we have already placed a photograph by Fuentes in the Metro section. Therefore, the remaining photograph in the Metro section could be by any of the three photographers. 
- D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue: This is not possible because if both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must also be two, which would mean that Fuentes couldn't have any photos in the Sports section.
- E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue: This is possible. We know that one of the photographs in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, and we have already placed a photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section could be by any of the three photographers. The two photographs in the Sports section could both be by Gagnon.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Six different photographs in total.
  - Exactly two photographs per section in each section: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - At least one, but no more than three, photographs per photographer must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then it means there can't be any photograph by Gagnon in the Lifestyle section. According to the rule, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer, who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes or Hue that has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This implies that the photographer whose photograph appears in the Lifestyle section should also have at least one image in the Metro section. Since Fuentes has a photo in the Lifestyle section, he must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means there is only one slot in the Metro section for either Hue or Gagnon. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. Consequently, none of the photographs in the Metro section is by Fuentes. As for the Sports section, according to the rule, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. As Fuentes has one photo in the Lifestyle section, he can have only one photo in the Sports section. Therefore, Both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue. Hence, the most suitable answer choice is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  
  We need to determine which scenario leads to the conclusion that Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  
Analysis:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. This assignment does not help us determine which year Mollie must be assigned to.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Ryan cannot be assigned to 1921, so we know that Ryan must be assigned to 1922. 
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, so Tiffany must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 in this scenario.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the same year, and thus Onyx must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 in this scenario.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922, since she cannot be assigned to the same year as Tiffany or Louis.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922 if she is assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  There are exactly six students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.

Analysis:
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then only Louis and Onyx would be available for the other two years, but Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, and Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's if Ryan is assigned to the project. Therefore, this cannot be the case. 
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis and Yoshio are available for the other two years. Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923 if Mollie is assigned to 1922, which means Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, and therefore Onyx does not have to be assigned to a specific year. This makes it possible for Mollie to be assigned to 1922 with Louis and Yoshio being assigned to the other two years.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We need to check which condition would make it necessary for Mollie to be assigned to 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Elimination:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924 - This condition doesn't have any impact on Mollie's assignment.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921 - If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922, which matches the condition mentioned in the question.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924 - This condition doesn't have any impact on Mollie's assignment.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923 - This condition only limits who can get assigned to 1923, but it doesn't have any impact on Mollie's assignment.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921 - This condition doesn't have any impact on Mollie's assignment.
  
Action: Answer("B") - Onyx is assigned to 1921.
Response 3:
Knowledge: Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, implying that no other students can be assigned to this year. Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922 if she is assigned to the project. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. 
A: Louis is assigned to 1924. We don't have any information about Mollie's assignment based on this condition.
B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922 because Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 and cannot be assigned to the year immediately before Onyx which is 1923.
C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. We don't have any information about Mollie's assignment based on this condition.
D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, so Louis must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Louis is assigned to 1922, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921. If Louis is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922. So, Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. We don't have any information about Mollie's assignment based on this condition.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned.
- If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.

Analysis:
- If Louis is assigned to 1924, it doesn't affect Mollie's assignment.
- If Onyx is assigned to 1921, Mollie could be assigned to 1922.
- If Onyx is assigned to 1924, Mollie could be assigned to 1921.
- If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, it means Louis must be assigned to the remaining year, 1924, and that doesn't affect Mollie's assignment.
- If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The project requires assigning 4 students to each year between 1921 and 1924, inclusive.
  There are six students available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, Yoshio.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  Assigning Mollie to 1921 would leave two students (Onyx and Ryan) to be assigned for 1922 and 1924, but Ryan cannot be assigned without Tiffany, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. That means that Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 and Ryan to 1924. In this case, Mollie must be the one assigned to 1922. Therefore, the answer is that Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- There are four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924.
- There are six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
- Each year is assigned to exactly one student.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned.
- If Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Reasoning:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Tiffany and Louis/Ryan/Onyx are assigned to the two remaining years. However, neither Louis nor Ryan can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
- If Louis is assigned to 1924 and Mollie is assigned to either 1921 or 1922, then Tiffany and Ryan must be assigned to the two remaining years. However, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923 if Louis is assigned to 1924. Therefore, this is not possible.
- If Onyx is assigned to either 1921 or 1924, this does not determine the assignments for Mollie, Tiffany, Louis, and Ryan.
- If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to one of the other years. However, this violates the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, this is not possible.
- If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922, Tiffany to 1924, and Ryan to 1923. This leaves only Louis for 1921, and Onyx for 1924. This is a possible assignment.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  * In the project, each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  * Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  * If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  * If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  * If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: Among the given choices, Tiffany is the only one who can be assigned to 1923, thus Ryan must also be part of the project, and if Ryan is part of the project, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. So Onyx must be assigned to 1922. However, if Mollie is part of the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Hence, Mollie must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, the correct option is (D) Tiffany is assigned to 1923. Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- We need to assign 4 students to the project, each one to a different year from the set {1921, 1922, 1923, 1924}.
- Mollie has to be assigned to either 1921 or 1922 if she is part of the project.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be, and Louis cannot.
- If Ryan is assigned to a year, then Onyx must be assigned to the one immediately prior to this year.
- We are asked which of the options forces Mollie to be assigned to 1922.

Analysis: 
- If Louis is assigned to 1924, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923, because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to that year. 
- If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie cannot be assigned to that year because she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 
- If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany cannot, because Ryan and Tiffany are mutually exclusive. 
- If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, and Onyx to 1922, but Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 because Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project if Louis is assigned to the same project. 
- If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie can be assigned to 1922, Tiffany to 1923, Ryan to 1924, and Onyx to 1921. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  - Louis or Tiffany can only be assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must also be assigned.
  - If Ryan is assigned, the Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. 
  A: No information is given about Louis's assignment.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921, and it is not possible to assign Mollie to 1921, because Mollie can only be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924, which does not provide any information on Mollie's assignment.
  D: If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then neither Louis nor Tiffany can be assigned to 1922, which means that Mollie must be assigned to 1922. However, there are other conditions involved that might conflict with Tiffany's and Ryan's assignments.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921, but if Mollie is assigned, then she must be assigned to 1921 or 1922, not Yoshio.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We are given a set of six items (fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles) with a set of restrictions on which items can and cannot be next to each other, and which bays they are in.
  From the given information, we know that if bay 4 is holding produce, then textiles is either in bay 3 or bay 5 (textiles is next to the bay holding produce).
  We know that livestock is not in bay 6 since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles and textiles is not in bay 6.
  So livestock is either in bay 4 or bay 5.
  We know that grain is not in bay 4, as the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock and livestock is in either bay 4 or bay 5. Thus, grain must be in bay 6.
  With the location of grain determined, we can also determine the location of fuel.
  Machinery's location must then be in bay 2, which means livestock must be in bay 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- Bay 4 is holding produce.
- The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
- The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
- The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
- The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
- There are exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.

Based on the given information, we know that:
- Bay 5 must hold textiles since textiles is next to produce and bay 4 is holding produce.
- Bay 6 must hold fuel since produce is higher than fuel and bay 5 is holding textiles.
- Bay 3 must hold livestock since livestock is higher than textiles and bay 5 is holding textiles.
- Bay 2 must hold grain since grain is higher than livestock and bay 3 is holding livestock.
- Bay 1 must hold machinery since all other cargo types have already been assigned to other bays.

Therefore, for exactly four of the six bays (bays 1, 2, 4, and 6), the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are six bays numbered 1 through 6.
  - There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. 
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Solution:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then we can deduce that:
  - The bay holding fuel must be bay 1
  - The bay holding textiles must be bay 2
  - The bay holding livestock must be bay 3
  - The bay holding grain must be bay 5
  - The bay holding machinery must be bay 6
  
  Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are completely determined, which is 5 bays in total. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 holds one of the six types of cargo, and so on up to bay 6.
  There are six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. 
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. 
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. 
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then bay 3 must be holding textiles, and the bay adjacent to 3 (either bay 2 or bay 4) must be holding textiles or produce. But since bay 4 is holding produce, then bay 2 must be holding textiles. 
  From the rules, we know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. So, bay 5 must be holding fuel and bay 6 must be holding grain. And, the bay holding livestock must be holding machinery. 
  
  Therefore, the types of cargo for all bays are completely determined, meaning the answer is E: six.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Action: Answer("D") 
If bay 4 is holding produce, then we can deduce the following:
- Bay 5 is holding textiles.
- Bay 6 is holding fuel.
- The bay holding livestock must be bay 2, and the bay holding grain must be bay 3.
Therefore, we have completely determined the type of cargo in bays 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which is a total of five bays. Thus, the answer is D: five.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  Textiles is next to produce.
  Livestock is in a lower-numbered bay than grain.
  Livestock is in a higher-numbered bay than textiles.
  Produce is in a higher-numbered bay than fuel.
  Six types of cargo are fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  
Solution:
  From the given information, we know that livestock is in a lower-numbered bay than grain and in a higher-numbered bay than textiles. Therefore, bay 1 or 2 must hold livestock, and bay 5 or 6 must hold grain, and textile is in either bay 3 or bay 5. Since we know that bay 4 holds produce, bay 3 must hold textile and bay 6 must hold grain. Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2 and 3 are completely determined, as well as the type of cargo for bays 4, 5 and 6. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- If bay 4 is holding produce, then based on the clues, the bay holding textiles must be holding fuel. That means the bay holding fuel has a lower number than the bay holding textiles.
- The bay holding livestock is not holding grain or produce, so it must be holding machinery or fuel.
- The bay holding grain must have the highest number since it has to be higher than the bay holding livestock.
- The bay holding textiles cannot be holding grain because the bay holding grain has the highest number.
- Based on the clues, the remaining cargo in the bay holding livestock is machinery, and the cargo in the bay holding grain is livestock.
- Therefore, the types of cargo for each bay are determined as follows: 
  Bay 1: Livestock
  Bay 2: Machinery
  Bay 3: Fuel
  Bay 4: Produce
  Bay 5: Textiles
  Bay 6: Grain
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then we know that bay 3 or bay 5 is holding textiles, so bay 2 or bay 6 must be holding livestock and the other one must be holding grain. That leaves fuel and machinery which could be in bay 1 or bay 6 (if bay 1 or bay 6 is holding grain or livestock, then the other bay must hold machinery or fuel, respectively). Therefore, for bay 4 holding produce, we know for sure the contents of the adjacent bays (3 and 5) and also the contents of the bays on the two ends of the dock (1 and 6).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then bay 3 or bay 5 must be holding textiles.
  There are no other constraints on which cargo goes into any of the other bays.
  
Reasoning: 
  If bay 4 is holding produce then bay 3 or bay 5 must be holding textiles. Since bay 6 must be holding grain, then bay 5 must be holding livestock and bay 3 must be holding textiles. Bay 1 must be holding fuel and bay 2 must be holding machinery.
  
  Therefore, the type of cargo for each bay is completely determined. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Bay numbers range from 1 to 6, inclusive.
  There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. 
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. 
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. 
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
Analysis:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then bays 5 and 6 cannot be holding produce. According to the second and third statements, livestock must be in bay 2 and textiles must be in either bay 3 or bay 5. Therefore, grain must be in bay 1 and fuel must be in bay 6. Thus, all six bays are completely determined by their cargo types.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The team will include at least Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  - A: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. So, this option is not possible since both Paine and Schmidt are included.
  - B: Neither Wong nor Myers are on the team. So, this option is not possible.
  - C: Wong is not in the team. So, this option is not possible since both Yoder and Paine are included.
  - D: This option satisfies all conditions.
  - E: This option is not possible since either Myers or Yoder should be in the team if Wong is in the team.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

A: Myers, Paine, Schmidt, and Thomson
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. So Paine cannot be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. So Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson all must be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. But Myers cannot be on the team because Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team. So this selection is not possible.

B: Ortega, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. But Myers is not on the team, so Ortega and Paine can both be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. But Schmidt is not on the team, so this condition doesn't apply.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. But Wong is not on the team, so this condition doesn't apply.
  Therefore, this is a possible selection of employees for the team.

C: Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. But Myers is not on the team, so this condition doesn't apply.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. So Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must all be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. But Wong is not on the team, so this condition doesn't apply.
  Therefore, this is not a possible selection of employees for the team.

D: Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. But Myers is not on the team, so this condition doesn't apply.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. So Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must all be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. But Wong is not on the team, so this condition doesn't apply.
  Therefore, this is not a possible selection of employees for the team.

E: Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. But Myers is not on the team, so this condition doesn't apply.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. But Schmidt is not on the team, so this condition doesn't apply.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. So Wong, Myers, and Yoder must all be on the team.
  Therefore, this is not a possible selection of employees for the team.

Action: Answer("B") 
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a set of eight employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Elimination:
  A: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. But this selection includes both Myers and Paine. Therefore, A is not a possible selection.
  B: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. This selection includes neither Myers nor Wong. Therefore, B is not a possible selection.
  C: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Neither Myers nor Wong is on the team in this selection. Therefore, C is not a possible selection.
  D: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. This selection includes Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. This selection includes Yoder, but neither Wong nor Myers. Therefore, D is not a possible selection.
  E: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. This selection includes Wong, Myers, and Yoder. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. This selection includes Thomson, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, E is a possible selection.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The team will include at least four employees: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, Zayre.
  - If Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. 
  - If Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
- Schmidt is selected. Since both Paine and Thomson must be on the team if Schmidt is selected, this means that Paine and Thomson are also on the team. 
- Wong is not selected.
- Myers cannot be on the team since Wong is not on the team. 
- Yoder can be on the team since Wong is not on the team. 
- Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team since Myers is not on the team. 
This leaves three people to select from: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. Since we already know which people cannot be on the team, we only have three people to select from, of which we need to select at least one. Therefore, one possible selection from these three people is Yoder. The final team is: Schmidt, Paine, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). 
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - A team of at least four employees is to be selected from eight employees.
  - If Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - If Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  - If Wong is selected, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
A: Myers cannot be on the team if Paine is on it. Also if Schmidt is on the team, Thomson must also be on it. Therefore, this selection is not possible.
B: Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is not on it, and Paine must be on the team if Schmidt is on it. Therefore, this selection is not possible.
C: This selection satisfies all the conditions and is a possible selection of four employees for the team.
D: This selection satisfies the condition that, if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. However, it does not satisfy the condition that, if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, this selection is not possible.
E: This selection satisfies the condition that, if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. However, it does not satisfy the condition that, if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, this selection is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  * The team will include at least four employees from a pool of eight.
  * Myers, Ortega, and Paine are mutually exclusive i.e. at most one of them can be on the team.
  * If Schmidt is on the team, then Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  * If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must be on the team.
  
Elimination:
  * (A) violates the rule that if Myers is on the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Therefore, (A) is not a possible selection.
  * (B) includes neither Myers nor Wong. If Wong is not on the team, then Myers does not have to be on the team. But if Myers is not on the team, then either Ortega or Paine can be on the team. Therefore, (B) is not a possible selection.
  * (C) violates the rule that if Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, (C) is not a possible selection.
  * (D) and (E) satisfy all the given constraints.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. The team will include at least four employees out of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  2. If Myers is on the team, then Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team.
  3. If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  4. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.

Elimination:
  - Option A can be eliminated because if Myers is on the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  - Option B can be eliminated because Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is not on the team.
  - Option C can be eliminated because Yoder must be on the team if Wong is on the team.
  - Option D satisfies all constraints.
  - Option E can be eliminated because Myers must be on the team if Wong is on the team.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees out of eight.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Elimination:
  A: If Myers is in the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be present. Hence, A is not possible.
  B: Ortega can not be with Myers in the team, and neither Myers nor Wong are there, making it impossible. Hence, B is not possible.
  C: We can have Paine and Schmidt, also Yoder satisfies the condition for Wong being there. Hence, C is a possible combination.
  D: Schmidt and Thomson are there, but none of the other conditions are satisfied. Hence, D is not possible.
  E: All conditions are satisfied, and four members are there. Hence, E is a possible combination. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

A: Myers and Paine cannot be on the team together. Schmidt is on the team but Thomson must also be on the team. This is not possible, so this is not the answer.
B: Myers is not on the team, so Wong cannot be on the team. This is not possible, so this is not the answer.
C: Schmidt is on the team, so both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Yoder is also on the team because Wong is not on the team. This is a possible selection of employees for the team.
D: Schmidt is on the team, so both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Yoder is also on the team because Wong is not on the team. This is a possible selection of employees for the team.
E: Wong is on the team, so both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Thomson is also on the team. This is not possible because Wong and Myers cannot be on the same team.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We have seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  We have three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. -> We don't know where Kim works, so this answer choice is not relevant to the given condition.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2. -> We don't know where Mahr works, so this answer choice is not relevant to the given condition.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. -> If this is true, then Tiao must work in Zone 1 and Udall must work in Zone 2. Then, Quinn and Stuckey must work in Zone 3, meaning that there are three sales representatives in Zone 3 (Quinn, Stuckey, and Parra) and only two in Zone 1 (Tiao and either Kim, Mahr, or the other of Parra/Tiao who is not in Zone 1). This means that the given condition that more reps work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 is false, so this answer choice is not possible.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1. -> If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3 and Udall must work in Zone 2. Then, Quinn and Stuckey must work in Zone 3, meaning that there are only two sales representatives in Zone 1 (Tiao and either Kim or Mahr) and three in Zone 3 (Parra, Quinn, Stuckey). This satisfies the given condition that more reps work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, so this answer choice is possible.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3. -> If Udall works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1 and either Parra or the other of Tiao/Udall must work in Zone 2. Then, Quinn and Stuckey must work in Zone 1, so there are only two sales representatives in Zone 3 (Parra + either Kim or Mahr) and only two in Zone 1 (Tiao + Udall). This means that the given condition that more reps work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3 is false, so this answer choice is not possible.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
- There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: 
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 (since only one of Parra and Tiao work in Zone 1).
- If Tiao does not work in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2 (since either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, and Tiao cannot work in Zone 1).
- If Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey must work in Zone 2 as well (since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone).
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3 (since there are 7 sales representatives in total).
- Parra cannot work in Zone 1 (since only one of Parra and Tiao work in Zone 1), and Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 2 or Zone 3.
- If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 2, then there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3 (since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2), and thus there are at most 4 sales representatives in total working in Zone 2 and Zone 3. This is a contradiction, since we know that at least 3 sales representatives work in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3.
- If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, then there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2 (and at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 1).
- Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Tiao must work in Zone 1 and Zone 2. Since there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 1. Therefore, only A and B could be true.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We are given the following information about the sales representatives and the sales zones:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - More of the sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We are asked to consider a scenario where more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  A: We do not know anything about whether or not Kim works in Zone 2, so this choice is not necessarily true.
  B: We do not know anything about whether or not Mahr works in Zone 2, so this choice is not necessarily true.
  C: Parra can only work in Zone 1 according to the given conditions. If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra cannot work in Zone 3. This choice is possible.
  D: Tiao can only work in Zone 1 or Zone 2 according to the given conditions. If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1. This choice is possible.
  E: Udall can only work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, and we do not know anything else about where Stuckey works. This choice is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("CD")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  We need to determine whether the given options could be true if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis: 
  Option A makes no reference to Zones 1 or 3, it is not relevant to the information we are given.
  Similarly, Option B makes no reference to Zones 1 or 3, so it is not relevant either.
  Now, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, that means that the number of sales representatives working in Zone 3 cannot be greater than 2, so it is impossible for both Parra and Tiao to be in Zone 3, which means that Option C is not possible.
  From the given conditions, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and this means that either Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2.  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well. In this case, there would be 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3, which contradicts our assumption that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, so this scenario is not possible. Therefore, we know that Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall does not work in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra works in Zone 1. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn must work in Zone 1 as well. Finally, since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, they cannot both work in Zone 3, so both Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 1.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. 
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: 
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 and fewer in Zone 3, then Parra must work in Zone 1, and Tiao must work in Zone 2. 
- This means that Udall and Stuckey must work in Zone 3, leaving Kim, Mahr, and Quinn to work in Zone 1 or Zone 2. 
- Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 2, and Quinn must work in Zone 1. 
- Therefore, the only option that is possible is B: Mahr works in Zone 2. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be two possible orderings of sales representatives across the three sales zones: (1) {Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3}, or (2) {Zone 1, Zone 3, Zone 2}. We need to consider the answer choices against these two possibilities to determine which ones could be true.

Action: 
  Option (A) is possible in the first ordering, or (2) {Zone 1, Zone 3, Zone 2}. Since the question says "could be true", we cannot eliminate this option.
  Option (B) is not possible in either of the two orderings because Mahr cannot be paired with Parra or Tiao because they are already paired up with someone else.
  Option (C) is possible in the second ordering, or (1) {Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3}. Therefore, it could be true.
  Option (D) is possible in the first ordering, or (2) {Zone 1, Zone 3, Zone 2}. Therefore, it could be true.
  Option (E) is possible in the second ordering, or (1) {Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3}. Therefore, it could be true.
  
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The sales representatives are Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The sales zones are Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: 
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 2 or in Zone 1 and Zone 3 respectively. 
  Therefore, Parra must work in Zone 1, and since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn must also work in Zone 1, and the remaining sales representatives work in Zone 3. 
  Therefore, none of them works in Zone 2.
  A: Kim could not work in Zone 2. This option is not possible.
  B: Mahr could not work in Zone 2. This option is not possible.
  C: Parra works in Zone 1, not in Zone 3. This option is not possible.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1. This option is possible.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3, not in Zone 1. This option is not possible.
  Answer: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The company employs seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be three sales representatives working in Zone 1 and two sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  - According to the given conditions, either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, the other representative must work in a different zone.
  - Similarly, either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, which means the other representative must work in a different zone.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other and there are only two representatives in Zone 3, so neither of them can be in Zone 3.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and we know that Udall cannot work in Zone 2, so they must both work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  
Action: 
  - Let's check which option is possible based on the above analysis.
  - A: Kim works in Zone 2. Not possible since we know that either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, and both of them are not in the answer choice.
  - B: Mahr works in Zone 2. Not possible since we know that either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, and both of them are not in the answer choice.
  - C: Parra works in Zone 3. Not possible since we know that Parra works in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  - D: Tiao works in Zone 1. Possible since we have three representatives in Zone 1 and Tiao is one of them while the other representative is in Zone 2.
  - E: Udall works in Zone 3. Not possible since we know that Udall and Stuckey work in the same zone, and Stuckey cannot work in Zone 3 because there are only two representatives in that zone.
  
Therefore, the answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are exactly seven sales representatives in three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then the number of sales representatives working in each zone can be 1, 2, 2 or 2, 1, 3.
  
Analysis:
  A: There are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 2. If Kim is in Zone 2, then there would be no sales representative left for Zone 1 and there would only be 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: Similar to A, if Mahr is in Zone 2, then there would be no sales representative left for Zone 1 and there would only be 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Udall must work in Zone 2. But in this case, there would be only 1 sales representative in Zone 3, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, Udall must work in Zone 2, and Quinn, Mahr, Kim, and Stuckey must work in Zone 3. In this case, there are 4 sales representatives in Zone 3, 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, and 1 sales representative in Zone 2, which satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 3, Parra must work in Zone 1, Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Quinn, Mahr, and Kim must work in Zone 3. In this case, there would be 4 sales representatives in Zone 3, 1 sales representative in Zone 1, and 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, E cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Possible deductions:
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then neither Parra nor Tiao work in Zone 3. Otherwise, there would be more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 1.
- Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2.
- If Stuckey and Udall work on different zones, then the zones would have 2 representatives each, which is not possible, so they must work in the same zone.
- Then, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall all work in the same zone, which is either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
- If Udall works in Zone 1, then there would be more representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, which is not possible given the information.
- Therefore, Udall works in Zone 3, which means there are 3 representatives in Zone 3 and 2 in Zone 2.
- Kim and Mahr must work in the same zone, and they cannot both work in Zone 3, so they both work in Zone 2.
- Hence, the only option that could be true is B: Mahr works in Zone 2.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. 
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

If Theresa tests J on the first day, then the second day Seamus must test H because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, A is not possible because Reynaldo cannot test F. B is not possible because Seamus must test H on the second day. C is possible because Yuki has not yet been assigned a first-day bike, and Theresa has not been assigned a second-day bike. D is not possible because Seamus must test H on the second day. E is not possible because Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.
  - Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H. 
  - Yuki tests the bicycle on the first day that Seamus tests on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day, but G cannot be tested on the first day, so A cannot be true.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day, it means that Yuki tests J on the first day, and Seamus tests J on the second day. Reynaldo can test G on the second day and Theresa tests F. This scenario satisfies all the conditions, so B could be true.
  C: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day. So C cannot be true because it implies that Yuki tests J on the second day.
  D: Seamus cannot be one of the testers for J because, based on the given conditions, Yuki tests J on the first day and Seamus tests J on the second day. So D cannot be true.
  E: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day. So E cannot be true because it implies that Theresa tests G on the first day.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki
  - Four bicycles: F, G, H, and J
  - Each rider tests one bicycle each day, and all bicycles are tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the second day because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Also, Reynaldo cannot test F.
 
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. Reynaldo cannot test F and we do not know if he has tested G already. This option could be true.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day. Theresa must be one of the testers for H so this option is not possible.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. This option is not possible because Yuki cannot test J.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test the bike that Yuki tests on the first day (which is not J), so this option is not possible.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. This option is not possible because Theresa tests J on the first day.

Action: Answer("A") 
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - Yuki tests the bicycle on day 1 that Seamus tests on day 2.
  - Each person tests only one bicycle per day.
  - Each bicycle is tested each day.
  
If Theresa tests J on day 1, then we know that Yuki must test H on day 1, and Seamus must test J on day 2. Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test H on day 2, because Yuki already did. This means that Reynaldo must test G on day 2. 

A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day - This is true, since Reynaldo cannot test F and must test G after Yuki tests H on day 1.
B: Seamus tests H on the first day - This is not possible because Yuki tests H on day 1.
C: Yuki tests H on the second day - This is not possible because Yuki already tests H on day 1.
D: Seamus is one of the testers for J - This is true, since Seamus tests J on day 2.
E: Theresa is one of the testers for G - This is not determined by the information given, and it is not impossible.

Action: Answer("AD")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J on the first day.
  Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F. 
  Yuki cannot test J. 
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H. 
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. 
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Explanation: 
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then, on the second day, Seamus must test the bike that Yuki tested on the first day, which cannot be J (since Yuki can't test J). Therefore, Seamus must test either F, G, or H. 
  - A is impossible because if Reynaldo tests G on the second day then Seamus would have to test F, but Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - B is also impossible because Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Seamus cannot test H on the first day. 
  - C is possible because, if Yuki tests, say, F on the first day, then Seamus must test F on the second day, leaving H available for Theresa on the second day. 
  - D is impossible because Seamus must test the bike that Yuki tested on the first day, which cannot be J. 
  - E is impossible because if Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test F, G, or H on the first day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 4 riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki.
  There are 4 bicycles: F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day. 
  If Yuki tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then she cannot test H on either day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day is possible.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day is not possible because Theresa must test H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day is not possible because Theresa cannot test H on either day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J is not possible because if Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day and Seamus must test J on the second day.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G is possible.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki— will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J on Day 1.
  Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on Day 2.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then by the rule "The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day", Seamus must test H on the first day to start the sequence. So, Seamus will test H on Day1, and since Yuki cannot test J, Yuki must test F on Day1. Theresa tests J on Day 1, so Reynaldo must test G on Day 1. Then, Yuki will test J on Day 2, so Seamus must test J on Day2. Now, Reynaldo cannot test F (which has already been tested), and he cannot test J (which Yuki will test), so he must test H. Therefore, Theresa must test G on Day 2.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Four riders- Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki and four bikes- F, G, H and J.
  - On the first day, the 4 riders test 4 bikes.
  - On the second day, each rider tests a different bike from the one they tested on the first day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, the J cannot be tested by Yuki on the first day. 
  
Solution:
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test the bike that Yuki is supposed to test on the first day.
  - Therefore, Seamus tests J on the first day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F. Therefore, Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  - Theresa is one of the testers for H. Therefore, Theresa tests H on the second day.
  - Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, Yuki must test F on the second day.
  
So, out of the given options:
  - A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. (Possible)
  - B: Seamus tests H on the first day. (Not Possible)
  - C: Yuki tests H on the second day. (Not Possible)
  - D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. (Confirmed)
  - E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. (Not Possible)
  
Action: Answer("A") - Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over a two-day period.
- Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
- Reynaldo cannot test F.
- Yuki cannot test J.
- Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
- Yuki tests a bicycle on the first day which will be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Action: Answer("C")
If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day, and Yuki cannot test J at all. Since Yuki has to test different bicycles on each day, she must test H on the second day, which satisfies the condition that Theresa must be one of the testers for H. This means that Seamus cannot test H on the first day. Therefore, A, B, and D are not possible. It is also not possible for Theresa to test G since she tests J on the first day. Thus, the only option that could be true is that Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Reynaldo cannot test F.
- Yuki cannot test J.
- Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
- The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
- Each rider can only test one bicycle per day.
- Each bicycle is tested by a different rider each day.
- There are 4 riders and 4 bicycles.
- Theresa tests J on the first day.

Plan:
- On the first day Theresa tests J, so Yuki cannot test J and must test F, G, or H.
- On the second day, Seamus must test the bicycle Yuki tested on the first day, which cannot be J, so Seamus must test F, G, or H.
- Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test J on the second day.
- Theresa must test H, leaving G to be tested by one of the remaining riders, which can be Seamus or Yuki.
- Therefore, A, B, and D are not possible, while C and E are possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
- There are 6 oral reports given by 6 students in 3 consecutive days, with 2 reports per day.
- George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
- We need to find the students who can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
- If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only 6 students (George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert) who can give reports.
- From the beginning, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they have to give morning reports. Therefore, Olivia and Robert will give morning reports on two different days.
- If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving both have to give reports on the next day. But since Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports, it means Nina is not giving a report to prevent Helen and Irving both giving a report on the same day.
- Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, George, and Robert.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We need to determine which students can give presentations in the morning on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give presentations. 
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. 
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Solution: 
  We can solve the problem by allocating the students that must give presentations to specific spots. Then whichever students are left can fill the remaining spots. 
  From the initial conditions, we know:
    - On Tuesday, George must give a presentation
    - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give a presentation in the afternoon
    - If Nina gives a presentation on Monday, then on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must both give presentations 
    
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give presentations, we know that these six students must give presentations: 
    - George
    - Helen or Irving (depending on when Nina presents)
    - Nina (unless she presents on Wednesday)
    - Three of the remaining five students
  
  Let's consider what happens if Nina presents on Monday:
    - On Tuesday both Helen and Irving must give presentations
    - On Wednesday, George can't present because he already presented, and Olivia and Robert can't present in the afternoon, so the morning presentations must be given by any combination of the remaining five students (Kyle, Lenore, Irving, Olivia, and Robert)
  
  Let's consider what happens if Nina presents on Wednesday:
    - On Monday, Helen and Irving cannot both present in the morning, so neither can present in the morning. The morning presentations must be given by any combination of the remaining five students (George, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, and Olivia).
    - On Tuesday, George already presented, so he can't present. The morning presentations must be given by any combination of the remaining five students (Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, and Nina).
    - On Wednesday, Helen and Irving must both present in the morning because they didn't present on Tuesday. 
    
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
    - A: Helen, George, and Nina
    - B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
    - C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
    - D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
    - E: Robert, George, and Helen
  
  The answer is (A) Helen, George, and Nina.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Six of the eight students will give individual oral reports during a three-day seminar.
  2. Each day has two reports, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. George will give his report on Tuesday.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving both must give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 

Working through the options:
- If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the students who can give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
- Since George gives his report on Tuesday, he cannot give the Monday morning report or the Wednesday morning report.
- Since both Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, one of them must give the Monday morning report and the other must give the Wednesday morning report.
- If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday because there is no room for both Helen and Irving to give reports on the following day.
- This means that if Nina gives a report, she must give it on Wednesday, and Helen and Irving must give their reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.

A: Helen, George, and Nina cannot be the correct answer since George's report is on Tuesday and Helen and Nina cannot both give morning reports on the same day.
B: Irving, Robert, and Helen can be the correct answer if Olivia and Nina do not give reports.
C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia cannot be the correct answer since Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving can be the correct answer if Nina and Helen do not give reports.
E: Robert, George, and Helen cannot be the correct answer since George's report is on Tuesday.

Therefore, the answer is B: Irving, Robert, and Helen.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The students who will give the individual oral reports are George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Exactly six of the students will give reports.
  Two reports will be given each day.
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina cannot be the answer because George can only give a report on Tuesday. If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina must give her report on Monday. Therefore, Helen and Nina cannot give reports on the same day.
  B: Irving and Robert can't give a report on Monday since Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports. Robert can't give an afternoon report, so he must give a morning report. If Irving also gives a morning report, then he must give a morning report the next day also which will violate the condition that there can be at most one report per person per day. Therefore, the answer cannot be B.
  C: Nina and Olivia cannot be the answer because if Nina's report is on Monday, then Helen and Irving have to give reports on Tuesday. But both of them already gave their reports on the first day which is a contradiction. Therefore, C cannot be the answer.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving cannot be the answer because both Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, but an afternoon report is required on Wednesday as there are only two reports left as of Wednesday. Therefore, D cannot be the answer.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The oral reports are given during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Exactly two reports are given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left who can give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The seminar consists of eight students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Each day, exactly two reports are given - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day that George can give a report.
  Robert and Olivia cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then only six students will give reports. Thus, two students will not give reports.
  
Analysis:
  Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, there will be only six student reports
  Since Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, George will give a report on Tuesday
  Since Robert and Olivia cannot give afternoon reports, Robert and Olivia will each give a morning report
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. However, since there is already a report scheduled for Wednesday, Nina will not give a report.
  Since George and Robert each give a report, two students remain who will not give reports. Therefore, the students giving reports must be selected from the remaining six students.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
  Based on the above analysis, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, George, and Nina.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The oral reports will be given by exactly six students during three consecutive days.
- Exactly two reports will be given each day: one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
- Tuesday is the only day that George can give a report.
- If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.

Working through the answer choices:
- Choice A: If Kyle and Lenore don't give a report, then Helen and Nina are both free to give a morning report on Monday and Tuesday respectively. However, since George can only give a report on Tuesday, this choice is not possible.
- Choice B: If Kyle and Lenore don't give a report, then Irving and Robert are free to give a morning report on Monday and Wednesday respectively. Helen cannot give a morning report on any day because Nina's report is not on Wednesday, and Helen cannot give a report the day after Irving and Helen give reports. This choice is not possible.
- Choice C: If Kyle and Lenore don't give a report, then there is no possibility for Olivia to give a morning report, so this choice is not possible.
- Choice D: If Kyle and Lenore don't give a report, then Robert and Irving are free to give a morning report on Monday and Wednesday respectively. George can give a morning report on Tuesday, and Olivia can give an afternoon report on Monday. This is a possible scenario.
- Choice E: If Kyle and Lenore don't give a report, then George can give a morning report on Tuesday, but then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday according to the rule. This means that neither Helen nor Irving can give a report on Monday. Robert can't give an afternoon report, so he must give a morning report on Monday. This leaves only one spot left for Helen, who can give an afternoon report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is also possible.

Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E") are both possible answers.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Six students will give individual reports during three consecutive days, each day with exactly two reports, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report then on the next day both Helen and Irving must give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Action: 
  From the statement "If Nina gives a report then on the next day both Helen and Irving must give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday", we can infer that if Nina gives a report on Monday (which means she does not give a report on Wednesday), then Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, we can conclude that Nina does not give a report on Monday and hence she must give a report on Wednesday.
  
  Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, only six out of the remaining students, excluding George, Olivia, and Robert, can give reports. We know that Nina must give a report on Wednesday and George can only give a report on Tuesday. Hence, George, Olivia, and Robert will give morning reports. This leaves three students - Helen, Irving, and Kyle/Lenore - to give the remaining three morning reports on Monday and Tuesday. Since Helen and Irving cannot give reports on the same day, Kyle and Lenore cannot both give a report on any of these days. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, George, and Nina. 
  
  Answer: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia and Robert will give reports.
Logic:
  - Since Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports, then George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia and Robert will give reports.
  - From the facts, we know that George will speak on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert will present in the afternoon.
  - If Nina speaks, then Helen and Irving will present on the day after Nina, unless Nina speaks on Wednesday.
  - If we assume Nina does not speak, then we have a total of 5 students who are speaking and 6 reports to allocate into 3 consecutive days.
  - This means that two students will give reports on two different days, and the remaining three students will give reports on the remaining day.
  - Since George must speak on Tuesday, then he must speak in the morning.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports on Monday and Wednesday but in which order?
  - If we assume Olivia speaks on Monday, then Robert must speak in the morning on Wednesday and Helen and Irving must both speak on Tuesday.
  - If we assume Robert speaks on Monday, then Olivia must speak in the morning on Wednesday and Helen and Irving must both speak on Tuesday.
Solution: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, there are only 6 students left who can give individual oral reports.
  - We need to find the combination of the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, that includes 3 students among the 6 remaining who can give reports.

Elimination: 
  - We can eliminate (D) because it includes Robert, who cannot give an afternoon report.
  - We can eliminate (C) because it includes Olivia, who cannot give an afternoon report.
  - We can eliminate (E) because it includes George, who can only give a report on Tuesday.
  - We can eliminate (A) because it includes Kyle, who can give a report.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We know that there are three shelves.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  
A: This choice does not determine on which shelf each book is placed.
B: This choice does not determine on which shelf each book is placed.
C: This choice does not determine on which shelf each book is placed.
D: This choice does not determine on which shelf each book is placed.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then L, M, and F must be on the same shelf since O is above L and F is below M. This would mean that the top shelf (where I is located) has only one book on it, but we know that there are at least two books on each shelf. Therefore, this choice is not possible. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  - From the given information, it is clear that F and M are placed on the same shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F. So, K and F cannot be on the same shelf.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L. So, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top. So, the top shelf must have exactly two books and the bottom shelf must have at least four books.
  - Since there are only three shelves, all the remaining three books - G, H, and L - must be on the same shelf. If they are not on the same shelf, it would be impossible to satisfy the given conditions.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed higher than F.
  - O is placed higher than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, that means there are only 2 possibilities: middle shelf or bottom shelf. This does not give us enough information to determine the placement of the other books. Therefore, A is not the answer.

B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, there are only two possibilities: top and middle shelves. This does not give us enough information to determine the placement of the other books. Therefore, B is not the answer.

C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, this means that they can only be on the top or middle shelf. This leaves the bottom shelf for the remaining 6 books. Since O is required to be on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the middle or top shelf. This leaves the bottom shelf for the remaining 5 books. Since K is required to be on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top or middle shelf, and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf. We already know that I is on the middle shelf, so that means that F must be on the middle shelf and K must be on the top shelf. This leaves only G, H, and M to be placed on the bottom shelf. Since the bottom shelf must have more books than the top shelf, we must place at least 3 of these books on the bottom shelf, and place the remaining 2 books on the top shelf. Therefore, C is the answer.

D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, that means they can only be on the top or bottom shelf. This does not give us enough information to determine the placement of the other books. Therefore, D is not the answer.

E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, that means they can only be on the top or middle shelf. This does not give us enough information to determine the placement of the other books. Therefore, E is not the answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. More books on bottom than on top.
  2. I is on the middle shelf.
  3. K is higher than F.
  4. O is higher than L.
  5. F is on the same shelf as M.
  
  A: If I and M are on the same shelf, we don't know where the remaining books are placed.
  B: If K and G are on the same shelf, we don't know where the remaining books are placed.
  C: If L and F are on the same shelf, we know that M is on the remaining shelf because F and M are on the same shelf. Also, O must be on the bottom shelf because O is higher than L. Therefore, H, I, K, and G must be on the middle shelf.
  D: If M and H are on the same shelf, we don't know where the remaining books are placed.
  E: If H and O are on the same shelf, we know that L and F are on the same shelf because O is higher than L. However, we don't know where the remaining books are placed.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 8 books and 3 shelves on the bookcase.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F and M are placed on the same shelf.
  
Analysis:
  Option A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we do not know the position of F, K, L, G, and O. This option alone is not sufficient.
  Option B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we do not know the position of I, F, L, M, and O. This option alone is not sufficient.
  Option C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M is also placed on the same shelf as well since F and M are on the same shelf. We know that K and O cannot be placed on this same shelf since K is on a higher shelf than F and O is on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, all books are placed on the shelf, and this option is the answer.
  Option D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we do not know the position of F, I, K, L, G, and O. This option alone is not sufficient.
  Option E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we do not know the position of F, I, K, L, G, and M. This option alone is not sufficient.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- There are only 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
- More books are on the bottom shelf than the top.
- I is on the middle shelf.
- K is higher than F.
- O is higher than L.
- F and M are on the same shelf.

Analyzing each choice:
A: If I and M are on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf they are on, and it doesn't help us determine the placement of the other books. 

B: We don't have any information that connects K and G, so if they are on the same shelf, we still can't determine the placement of the other books.

C: If F and L are on the same shelf, then we know that M is also on that shelf, since F and M are on the same shelf. From there, we can deduce that K and G are on the top shelf (since K is higher than F), leaving H, I, and O to be split between the middle and bottom shelves. So choice C does fully determine the placement of the books. 

D: If H and M are on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf they are on, and it doesn't help us determine the placement of the other books.

E: If H and O are on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf they are on, and it doesn't help us determine the placement of the other books.

Answer: Choice C, L and F are placed on the same shelf.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The top shelf has fewer books than the bottom shelf.
  Condition: I is placed on the middle shelf
  Condition: K is placed on a higher shelf than F
  Condition: O is placed on a higher shelf than L
  Condition: F is placed on the same shelf as M

A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we do not know anything about the placement of the other books. This condition is not sufficient to determine the placement of the books.
B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we do not know anything about the placement of the other books. This condition is not sufficient to determine the placement of the books.
C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we can infer that M is placed on the top shelf, and the other books are placed on the bottom shelf. This condition is sufficient to determine the placement of the books.
D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we can infer that F is also on this shelf by the condition that F and M are placed on the same shelf, but we do not know anything about the placement of the other books. This condition is not sufficient to determine the placement of the books.
E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we can infer that L and F are on the top shelf, and the other books are on the bottom shelf. This condition is sufficient to determine the placement of the books.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O)
  - 3 shelves
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books
  - Bottom shelf > Top shelf
  - I is on the Middle shelf
  - K is on a higher shelf than F
  - O is on a higher shelf than L
  - F is on the same shelf as M
  
  A: If I and M are on the same shelf, we still don't know where the other books are placed so this is not enough information to fully determine the placement of all books.
  B: If K and G are on the same shelf, we still don't know where the other books are placed so this is not enough information to fully determine the placement of all books.
  C: If L and F are on the same shelf, we already know that F is on the same shelf as M, but we don't know where the other books are placed, so this is not enough information to fully determine the placement of all books.
  D: If M and H are on the same shelf, we know that F must be on a different shelf than M and H, but we still don't know where the other books are placed so this is not enough information to fully determine the placement of all books.
  E: If H and O are on the same shelf, we still don't know where the other books are placed so this is not enough information to fully determine the placement of all books.
  Since none of these options provides enough information to fully determine the placement of all books, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Eight books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves.
  - The following conditions must apply:
    - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
    - I is placed on the middle shelf.
    - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
    - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
    - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

To determine which one of the choices is true, we need to see which choice provides enough information to determine the position of each book.

A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  - We know that I is placed on the middle shelf and F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - However, we still don't know the positions of the other books.
  
B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  - We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - However, we still don't know the positions of the other books.
  
C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  - We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - However, we still don't know the positions of the other books.
  
D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  - We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  - However, we still don't know the positions of the other books.
  
E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  - Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, H must be placed on the same shelf as L.
  - We also know that I is placed on the middle shelf, which means the remaining three books (F, G, and K) must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  - Finally, since K must be placed on a higher shelf than F, K and O must be placed on the top shelf, and F, G, H, and L must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  2. I is placed on the middle shelf.
  3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 1, no more than 3 books are placed on the top shelf. 
  From condition 2, I can only be on the middle shelf, which means H cannot be on the middle shelf. 
  From condition 3, if K is on the top shelf, then F must be on the top shelf too, which means that all four books on the top shelf are K, F, and two other books. However, this contradicts condition 1 because there are only 2 books on the top shelf. Therefore, K must be on the middle or bottom shelf. 
  From condition 4, O cannot be on the bottom shelf, which means O must be on the top or middle shelf. 
  From condition 5, F and M are on the same shelf, which means they cannot both be on the top or bottom shelf. Therefore, F and M are on the middle shelf with I. The books left to place are G, H, K, and O. From condition 3, K must be on the same shelf or higher than O. 
  
Checking the choices:
  A: If I and M are on the same shelf, then F must be on that same shelf, which contradicts condition 1. 
  B: If K and G are on the same shelf, then they both must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since K cannot be on the bottom shelf, both K and G must be on the middle shelf, which is possible according to the analysis. 
  C: If L and F are on the same shelf, then they must both be on the middle shelf with I and M, which means there would be four books on the middle shelf, which contradicts condition 1.
  D: If M and H are on the same shelf, then they must be on the middle shelf with I and F, which means that K and O must be on the bottom shelf, which contradicts condition 4.
  E: If H and O are on the same shelf, then they must be on the middle or bottom shelf. However, K must be on the same shelf or higher than O. Therefore, this is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.
  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
A: Franco can testify on Monday, but it is not necessary for him to be the only one. 
B: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Hence Franco cannot testify on the same day as Iturbe. 
C: Hong cannot testify on Monday, which means Hong can either testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. However, Garcia and Hong cannot testify on the same day since Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, it is impossible for Garcia and Hong to both testify on Tuesday. 
D: If Garcia is the only witness to testify on Monday, then at least one of Franco, Hong, Iturbe, or Jackson must testify on Wednesday along with Hong. But, Iturbe already testifies on Wednesday which means it's impossible for him to testify again on Monday or Tuesday. Hence, this schedule is not possible. 
E: If Jackson testifies on Tuesday, then the other witness should be either Franco, Garcia, or Hong. And, since Hong cannot testify on Monday, it should be either Franco or Garcia. Therefore, two witnesses can testify on Monday. This is a valid schedule. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
- The hearing is 3 days long: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
- Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.

A: Franco can testify on Monday, but at least one more witness would have to testify with him, which would contradict the requirement that at least two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Therefore, this cannot be true of the schedule.
B: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco and Iturbe cannot testify on the same day. This cannot be true of the schedule.
C: Garcia and Hong cannot testify on the same day, but if they testify on different days, they can both testify on Tuesday. This can be true of the schedule.
D: Garcia cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. This cannot be true of the schedule.
E: If Franco and at least one other witness testify on Monday, then at most 2 witnesses can testify on Tuesday. Therefore, it is not possible for Jackson and 2 other witnesses to testify on Tuesday if at least one witness testifies on Monday. This cannot be true of the schedule.

Action: Answer("E")

A: Franco cannot be the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday because at least one witness must testify on Monday.
B: Franco and Iturbe cannot testify on the same day because Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.
C: Garcia and Hong cannot both testify on Tuesday because exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday and Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, if Garcia testifies on Tuesday, Hong cannot.
D: This schedule is possible. Garcia testifies on Monday, Hong and Jackson testify on Wednesday, and Franco and Iturbe testify on Tuesday.
E: This schedule is possible. Jackson and Hong testify on Tuesday, and Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Franco and Garcia testify on Monday.

  3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
  5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
A: If Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, there must be only one witness who testifies on Monday (because there must be at least one witness who testifies on Monday). This satisfies the conditions.
B: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe, then Garcia, Hong and Jackson will be scheduled to testify on the other two days, which means that Hong will testify on Monday, which contradicts condition 4. Therefore, this option CANNOT be true.
C: If Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday, then Franco and Jackson must testify on Monday and Wednesday, but there must be at least two witnesses who testify on Tuesday, so this option satisfies the conditions.
D: If Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, then Hong cannot be one of the two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday because there must be at least one witness who testifies on Monday. Therefore, this option CANNOT be true.
E: If Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday, then two witnesses must testify on Monday. This satisfies the conditions.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Since Theresa tests G on the second day, H must be the bicycle that Theresa tests on the first day. Therefore, conditions (1) and (3) cannot apply to Theresa and H, so Reynaldo must test H on the first day to satisfy condition (1), and Yuki must test J on the first day to satisfy condition (2). This means that Seamus must test Yuki's bicycle, J, on the second day, satisfying condition (4). Therefore, choice D is the only option that must be true in this scenario.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  From the rules given, we know that:
  * Reynaldo cannot test F.
  * Yuki cannot test J.
  * Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  * The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Analysis:
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then in order to satisfy the conditions: 
  * Seamus cannot be the one testing G on the first day, because then he would be required to test H on the second day, which is Theresa's assigned bicycle.
  * Reynaldo cannot be the one testing G on the first day, because he cannot test F and there are no other bicycles available for him to test.
  * Yuki cannot be the one testing G on the first day, because she cannot test J and there are no other bicycles available for her to test on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus must be the one testing G on the first day and Reynaldo must be the one testing J on the first day.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
If Theresa tests G on the second day, then:
- Since Theresa must test H on one of the two days, she must test H on the first day and G on the second day.
- Yuki cannot test J, so she must test F, H, or J on the first day.
- The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, so Seamus cannot test G on either day.
- Reynaldo cannot test F, which means Reynaldo must test J on the first day.
Therefore, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("B") Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  5. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  6. Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test H on the second day as Theresa has to be one of the testers for H. Also, as each rider tests only one bicycle per day, it means Theresa cannot test G on the first day. Therefore, she must test H on the first day. Since Theresa tests H on the first day, Yuki cannot test H on the first day, but Yuki must test the bicycle that Seamus tests on the second day. Therefore, Yuki will test J on the first day. Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki will be testing J on the first day, which means Reynaldo must test J on the first day.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki
- Four bicycles: F, G, H, and J
- Each rider will test a different bicycle on each of the two days.
- Condition 1: Reynaldo cannot test F.
- Condition 2: Yuki cannot test J.
- Condition 3: Theresa must test H on one of the two days.
- Condition 4: Yuki's first-day bicycle must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then:
- Yuki did not test G on the first day (otherwise Yuki would have to test J on the second day, which is not possible)
- Seamus did not test G on the first day (otherwise Yuki would have tested J on the second day)
- Reynaldo did not test G on the first day (otherwise Reynaldo would have to test H on the second day)
Therefore, Reynaldo tested J on the first day, and Seamus tested either F or H. Since Yuki did not test H on the first day, Seamus must have tested H. Therefore, on the first day: Reynaldo tested J, Seamus tested H, Theresa tested F or J, and Yuki tested either F or G.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, she cannot test H on the second day.
  
Analysis:
  Theresa must test H on the first day, as she must be one of the testers for it.
  Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Seamus must test it on the first day. Therefore, Yuki tests H on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test J on the first day.
  
  On the second day, Theresa tests G and Yuki tests J. Reynaldo must test F on the second day, and Seamus must test H on the second day.
  
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that Reynaldo tests J on the first day. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Theresa tests H on one of the two days.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  The bicycle tested by Yuki on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she will test H on the first day.
  Seamus must test the bike Yuki tests on the first day.
  Hence, Reynaldo can either test F or J on the first day.
Analysis:
  From the given information, Theresa should be testing the bicycle H on the first day if she is testing G on the second day.
  Therefore, we can conclude that Theresa will test H on the first day and not on the second day.
  Thus, Choice C is not correct.
  Also, if Theresa tests H on the first day, then she cannot test J on the first day, hence Choice D is also wrong.
  Reynaldo can either test F or J on the first day.
  If Reynaldo tests F on the first day, then Seamus will test J on the first day and Yuki will test G on the first day. This will make Yuki test H on the second day, which is not possible, hence Reynaldo must test J on the first day. 
  This makes Seamus test F on the first day and Yuki test G on the first day. Therefore, Seamus must test H on the second day.
  This makes Reynaldo test either F or J on the first day.
  Hence, Choice B is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H on one of the two days.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then we can immediately infer that:
  - Theresa did not test G on the first day, because she must test H on one of the two days.
  - Yuki tested G on the first day, because Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day, and only bicycle G is left for Seamus.
  
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices A, B, C, and D because they are not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  5. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  6. If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she cannot test G on the first day. 

Solution:
Theresa must test H on the first day (because she must test H, and she cannot test G).

Since Theresa tests G on the second day, Yuki must test G on the first day. This means that Seamus must test G on the second day (because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day).

Reynaldo cannot test F (rule 1), and Yuki tests G on the first day, so Reynaldo must test J on the first day (rule 2).

Therefore, the only true statement is:
Action: Answer("B") Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We know that Theresa must test H at some point.
  Yuki cannot test J, and Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Each rider can only test one bike per day, and each bike must be tested on both days.
  
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, it means that H is not available to be tested on the second day, and therefore Theresa must test H on the first day. This also means that Seamus must test G on the second day, since he must test the bike that Yuki tested on the first day. This also means that Yuki must test J on the first day, since Reynaldo cannot test F.
  
  Thus, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("D")  Theresa tests J on the first day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions:
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  We need to determine which option uniquely determines the order of editing.
  Rearranging the given conditions we have:
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. => J < G < R
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. => No two consecutive articles have the same topic
  - S must be earlier than Y. => S < Y
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. => If S is not third, then Q must be third.
  - Finally, we have the list of articles which we can arrange : G, H, J, Q, R, S, Y 
  
  We need to find the condition that would uniquely determine the sequence.
  
  A: If H is fourth, we can have QSR and GJHY in some order. But we don't know if H comes before or after GJHY, so this option does not uniquely determine the sequence.
  
  B: If H is sixth, we can partition the list as QSR|J|G|Y|H. But we don't know if G comes before or after J, so this option does not uniquely determine the sequence.
  
  C: If R is fourth, then it must be the case that G and J appears before R. Then the only valid combination of GJ is GJH (since no two consecutive articles can cover the same topic), and the only valid position for H is sixth.
  We are left with QSR|GJH|Y. This option uniquely determines the sequence.
  
  D: If R is seventh, then G and J must appear before R. In this case, we can have only one combination of GJ, which is JGH (since we cannot have H before G). Then the only valid position for H is sixth. We are left with QSRY|GJH. This option uniquely determines the sequence. 
  
  E: If Y is fifth, we must have S before Y. However, we don't know how to arrange the other articles. Therefore, this option does not uniquely determine the sequence.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  There are 3 finance articles: G, H, and J.
  There are 3 nutrition articles: Q, R, and S.
  There is 1 wildlife article: Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis: 
  To determine the order in which the articles are edited, we need to use the given conditions to create a sequence of the articles that satisfies all the conditions. The following deductions can be made based on the given conditions:
  1. The nutrition articles (Q, R, S) cannot be consecutive, so they must be separated by finance or wildlife articles.
  2. The finance articles (G, H, J) cannot be consecutive, so they must be separated by nutrition or wildlife articles.
  3. S must be earlier than Y, so we can place them in the sequence as follows: S _ _ _ Y
  4. Q must be third if S is before Q, so the sequence can be S _ Q Y.
  5. G must be earlier than R, so we can place them in the sequence as follows: S _ Q Y _ G _ R.
  6. J must be earlier than G, so the sequence can be S _ Q Y _ J _ G _ R.
  Now, we can place the remaining article, which is H, in the sequence. The possible positions for H are fourth, fifth, or sixth. We need to check which one of these positions will satisfy all of the conditions.
  A: If H is fourth, the sequence becomes S _ Q Y H _ J _ G _ R, which violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y.
  B: If H is sixth, the sequence becomes S _ Q Y _ J _ G H R, which satisfies all of the conditions. 
  C: If R is fourth, the sequence becomes S _ Q Y _ J _ G R _ H, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  D: If R is seventh, the sequence becomes S _ Q Y _ J _ G _ H R, which satisfies all of the conditions.
  E: If Y is fifth, the sequence becomes S _ Q _ Y J _ G _ R H, which violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- There are seven articles that need to be edited; three are about finance, three are about nutrition, and one is about wildlife.
- Consecutive articles can't cover the same topic.
- The order is subject to several conditions about the order in which the articles can be edited.
- We need to determine which condition allows us to determine the full order of the articles.

A: H is 4th:
- If H is fourth, the first three articles must be about nutrition, and they can only be in the order QRS or SRQ.
- In either case, S must be the first or second article edited, followed by Q or R.
- After that, the next three articles can only be GJY or JGY, in that order, which can be arranged in two ways.
- Therefore, we can't determine the full order of the articles from this condition.
- A is not the answer.

B: H is 6th:
- If H is sixth, the seventh article must be about nutrition, and it can only be Q or R.
- If the seventh article is Q, then S must be the third article edited, followed by R and then GJY or JGY in that order, which can be arranged in two ways.
- If the seventh article is R, then G must be the first article edited, followed by J, H, S, Q and Y in that order.
- Therefore, we can determine the full order of the articles if H is sixth.
- B is the answer.

C: R is fourth:
- If R is fourth, the first three articles must be about finance, and they can only be in the order GHJ or JHG, in that order.
- After that, S must be the fifth article edited, followed by Q.
- The last two articles must be GJY or JGY in that order. 
- Therefore, we can determine the full order of the articles if R is fourth.
- C is the answer.

D: R is seventh:
- If R is seventh, the order of the first three articles must be GHJ or JHG, in that order.
- After that, the order of the nutrition articles is irrelevant.
- The seventh article must be R, so the fourth article can only be about wildlife.
- The last two articles must be GJY or JGY in that order, which can be arranged in two ways.
- Therefore, we can determine the full order of the articles if R is seventh.
- D is the answer.

E: Y is fifth:
- If Y is fifth, then S must be the third article edited and Q must be the fourth.
- After that, the order of the finance articles can only be GJY or JGY in that order.
- The last two articles must be R and H, in that order.
- Therefore, we can determine the full order of the articles if Y is fifth.
- E is the answer.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles to be edited. 
  G, H, J cover finance; Q, R, S cover nutrition; Y covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A, B, C and D do not specify any of the articles that need to be earlier or later than others to determine the full order. 
E, however, specifies that Y is fifth, meaning that S must be earlier than Y. We also know from the given information that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, the order must be: 
  Q _ _ S _ Y G R _ _ _ _ _ _
Q and S cannot be consecutive, so Q must be third. This means that the order is fully determined to be:
  G R Q S H J Y 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The articles can be divided into two groups: finance (G, H, J) and non-finance (Q, R, S, Y).
  The order is subject to the following conditions:
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  Let's analyze each choice:
  A: H is fourth. It means that the first three articles have been edited. We don't know the topics of those articles, so we cannot determine anything about the remaining four articles. 
  B: H is sixth. Since there are only seven articles, if H is sixth, we know that the first five articles have been edited. The articles can be ordered in the following way: Q, R, S, G/J, G/J, H, Y. This satisfies all the conditions, so the answer is fully determined.
  C: R is fourth. It means that the first three articles have been edited and one of them is R. We cannot determine the order of the remaining articles because there are different possibilities depending on the topics of the first three articles.
  D: R is seventh. It means that the first six articles have been edited and one of them is R. We can determine that the order of the first three articles is Q, S, R, and that the order of the remaining finance articles is J, G, H. However, we cannot determine the position of Y because it can be either fourth or fifth.
  E: Y is fifth. It means that the first four articles have been edited and one of them is S. We cannot determine the order of the remaining articles because there are different possibilities depending on the topics of the first four articles.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- We need to edit 7 articles and there are 3 categories of these articles.
- G, H, and J cover finance.
- Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
- Y covers wildlife.
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
- S must be earlier than Y.
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: If H is fourth, we do not know which articles were edited before it. Also, we do not know which articles we can edit after article H. Therefore, this option does not fully determine the order of the articles.
B: If H is sixth, we know that the first two articles can not be a finance or nutrition article, and we know that Q must be third. We also know that S must be earlier than Y; therefore, S will be the fourth article and Q will be the fifth article. As a result, we know that G and J can only be the sixth and seventh articles but we do not know which one will be edited first. We also do not know the order of R and Y. Therefore, this option does not fully determine the order of the articles.
C: If R is fourth, then S must be the third article, Q must be the second article, and H must be the first article. Also, we know that G, Y, and J are the fifth, sixth, and seventh articles, respectively. Therefore, this option fully determines the order of the articles and is the answer. 
D: If R is seventh, we do not know which articles were edited before it. Also, we do not know which articles we can edit after article R. Therefore, this option does not fully determine the order of the articles.
E: If Y is the fifth article, we know that S must be earlier than Y and that Q must be the third article. However, we do not know the order of H, G, J, R, and the remaining nutrition article. Therefore, this option does not fully determine the order of the articles.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - G, H, and J are finance articles.
  - Q, R, and S are nutrition articles.
  - Y is a wildlife article.
  - No consecutive articles can cover the same topic as each other.
  - S must be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

To determine the order of the articles, we can use the following logic:
- Y must be last.
- S must be earlier than Q. If Q is third, then S can be second and Q can be third. If Q is not third, S cannot be earlier than Q.
- J, G, and R must be in the order J-G-R, and they must each cover a different topic from the previous article edited.
- If H is fourth, then the order must be as follows: S _ Q _ H _ G _ R _ J _ Y. This satisfies all of the conditions.
- If H is sixth, then the order must be as follows: S _ Q _ R _ J _ G _ H _ Y. This satisfies all of the conditions.
- If R is fourth, then the order must be as follows: S _ Q _ R _ G _ J _ H _ Y. This satisfies all of the conditions.
- If R is seventh, then the order must be as follows: S _ Q _ G _ H _ J _ R _ Y. This satisfies all of the conditions.
- If Y is fifth, then the order must be as follows: S _ Q _ G _ H _ Y _ J _ R. However, this violates the condition that Y must be last.

Action: Answer("A")  
Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if H is fourth.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, Y.
  There are three topics: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If H is fourth, it means that either Q or R will be edited before S, and the order in which articles are edited is not fully determined.
  If H is sixth, it means that G and J will be edited before H, and the order in which articles are edited is not fully determined.
  If R is fourth, it means that S must be fifth and Q must be third. Then, the order can be determined as follows: J-G-R-H-Q-S-Y.
  If R is seventh, it means that S must be fifth, Q must be third, and G must be first. Then the order can be determined as follows: G-J-R-H-Q-S-Y.
  If Y is fifth, it means that S must be fourth and either Q or R must be third. Then, the order in which articles are edited is not fully determined.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The order of the articles is subject to the following conditions:
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  The articles are:
  - 3 finance articles: G, H, and J
  - 3 nutrition articles: Q, R, and S
  - 1 wildlife article: Y
  
  We want to determine which statement gives enough information to fully determine the order in which the articles are edited.
  
Analysis:
  - If H is fourth, we don't know anything about QRSY, and we don't know if G comes before J, or if R comes before G. This information is not sufficient.
  - If H is sixth, there are only two possible scenarios:
      1. GJQRSY
      2. JGQRSY
    However, we don't know which scenario is correct, so this information is also not sufficient.
  - If R is fourth, we know that the order is either:
      1. QSGRJY
      2. SQRGJY
    But we don't know which of these is correct, so this information is also not sufficient.
  - If R is seventh, we know that the order is either:
      1. SQHGJRY
      2. SQJHGRY
    But we don't know which of these is correct, so this information is also not sufficient.
  - If Y is fifth, we can determine the order as follows:
      - S must be first (because S must be earlier than Y)
      - Q must be third (because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third)
      - R must be seventh (because consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other, and R cannot be earlier than G, which means it must be seventh)
      - The remaining articles can be ordered as GJHY in any order.
    Therefore, the answer is E.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Three articles cover finance (G, H, and J).
  2. Three articles cover nutrition (Q, R, and S).
  3. One article covers wildlife (Y).
  4. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  5. The order is subject to certain conditions which are:
        a. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
        b. S must be earlier than Y.
        c. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Solving the problem: 
The order of editing the articles would look like:
Q__R__S__ G__J__H__Y or 
R__Q__S__ G__J__H__Y
The sixth article must be H, but we don't know whether it will be edited before or after the three nutrition articles (Q, R, S). So, we cannot determine the exact order in which the articles are edited.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- F and M are on the same shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- G is placed on the top shelf.
- At least two books are placed on each shelf. 

If G is on the top shelf, there are at most three books on the bottom shelf. Also, since there are at least two books on each shelf, there are at most two books on the middle shelf. We know that I is on the middle shelf, so we need to find one or two more books to put on that shelf. 

If we put H on the middle shelf, then L and O must be on the bottom shelf, and F, G, and M must be on the top shelf. This satisfies all the given conditions, so the answer is (A) H, I. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We know from the conditions that:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, there are at least 2 books on the top shelf, one book (I) on the middle shelf, and at least 3 books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, G can't be on the top shelf and the answer must be one of the choices with H, I, K, and L on the middle shelf.
  
  A: H is not mentioned to be on the same shelf as I, so this is not possible.
  B: I is on the middle shelf, but L is on the top shelf. This is not possible.
  C: H, I, and L are all on different shelves, so this is not possible.
  D: K is not mentioned to be on the middle shelf, so this is not possible.
  E: We know from the conditions that F is on the same shelf as M and K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, K can not be on the middle shelf if F and M are there. This is not possible.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are eight books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O).
  - There are three shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  - Each shelf must have at least two books.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
If G is placed on the top shelf, then F and M must be placed on the same shelf (based on the condition that F is placed on the same shelf as M). So F and M cannot be placed on the top shelf, and must be placed on either the middle or the bottom shelf. Since there must be at least two books on the middle shelf, and I is already placed on the middle shelf, then the other book on the middle shelf must be either L or K. 

Action: Answer("B") 
The complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf could be I and L, as L is the only book in the option that is not on the same shelf as any of the other books listed.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. 
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, exactly one book must be placed with G on the top shelf, and the remaining books must be placed on the other two shelves.
  F is placed with M.
  
Analysis: 
  If G is on the top shelf, then the other two shelves (middle and bottom) must have at least one book each, and only one book can be paired with G on the top shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, G cannot be paired with I. Given that K is placed on a higher shelf than F and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, neither K nor O can be paired with G on the top shelf. This leaves four remaining books (H, I, L, and M) to be placed on the middle and bottom shelves, but we know that more books must be placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. Therefore, H and I must be on the middle shelf, and L and M must be on the bottom shelf.

Answer: Answer("A") H, I.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  We know that 8 books are placed on 3 shelves. We also know that each shelf has at least 2 books. 
  More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf. 
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then H must be on a shelf lower than the top shelf.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If G is on the top shelf, then only two books can be on the top shelf.
  I must be on the middle shelf. 
  K must be on a shelf higher than F which means that K and F can not be on the same shelf. 
  If G is on the top shelf, then H must be on a shelf lower than the top shelf. 
  In order for O to be on a higher shelf than L, L must be on either the top or middle shelf.
  If F is on the bottom shelf, then M must be on the bottom shelf as well. 
  Therefore, the only possible arrangement is:
  Top shelf: G, L
  Middle shelf: I, L
  Bottom shelf: F, M, H, O 
  The complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I, L. 
  The only possible answer is (B).
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- There are 8 books named F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
- There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
- The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
- Book I is on the middle shelf.
- Book K is on a higher shelf than F.
- Book O is on a higher shelf than L.
- Books F and M are on the same shelf.

We know that G is on the top shelf. Since there are at least two books on each shelf, F and M cannot both be on the top shelf. Therefore, F and M are on the bottom or middle shelf. However, we know that I is on the middle shelf, so F and M cannot be on the middle shelf. Therefore, F and M are on the bottom shelf.

The remaining books on the top and bottom shelves are H, K, and O, but it is not clear which book is on which shelf. However, we know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K is on the top or middle shelf. 

Finally, we know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O is on the top or middle shelf. This means that H and L are on the bottom shelf.

We know that I is on the middle shelf and F and M are on the bottom shelf. Therefore, the complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is [I].
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  2. I is placed on the middle shelf.
  3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.

If G is placed on the top shelf, then the books on the bottom shelf are F, K, L, M, and O. Therefore, the books on the middle shelf must be I and one of H or L. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  We know that the following conditions must apply:
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, we must place three other books on that shelf. We know that at least two books are placed on each shelf, so there must also be at least two books on the middle shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, we only need to determine the other two books on that shelf.
  H, L, K, M, and O are not placed on the top shelf since G is already there.
  A: H is a candidate book for the middle shelf, but we cannot place it on the middle shelf with I because that would violate the rule that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  B: I is placed on the middle shelf, but L is not a candidate book for the middle shelf since it is not placed on the top shelf. Therefore, we cannot have I and L on the middle shelf.
  C: H is a candidate book for the middle shelf, but we cannot place it on the middle shelf with I because that would violate the rule that at least two books are placed on each shelf. L is also not a candidate book for the middle shelf since it is not placed on the top shelf.
  D: K is a candidate book for the middle shelf, but we cannot have K and L on the middle shelf since K is placed on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, we cannot have I, K, and L on the middle shelf.
  E: We cannot have F on the top shelf with G, so F must be placed on the bottom or middle shelf. However, we know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so we cannot place F on the middle shelf with I. Therefore, we cannot have I, F, and M on the middle shelf. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The books are: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  There are three shelves, top, middle, and bottom, with at least two books on each shelf.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, there must be at least two other books on the top shelf and more than two books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, H, I, K, L, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf or the middle shelf. We know that I is on the middle shelf, so either H, K, L, or O must also be on the middle shelf. We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the same shelf as F. Therefore, the only option for the books placed on the middle shelf is I and L.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the remaining books (besides I) must be placed on the bottom shelf and middle shelf.
  If we put H and L on the bottom shelf and K, M, and O on the middle shelf, then the conditions are satisfied.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The antiques to be auctioned are a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase, to be auctioned one item each day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Harmonica should be auctioned before the lamp for the mirror to be auctioned before the lamp.
  Sundial should be auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  Table should be auctioned before the vase or before the harmonica but not both.

Action: Answer("E")
If the table is auctioned on a date later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then it means that only the harmonica, sundial, and lamp remain to be auctioned, and their order is open. Therefore, there is no certainty about which one of the harmonica or lamp is auctioned first, so we cannot say that option A or B could be true. 
Since the table is being auctioned after the vase and mirror, it means that the sundial was auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. That means option E, "The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp," could be true. Option C and D are also not necessarily true given the information we have. Therefore, the best answer is E.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The order of the antique auctions is as follows:
day 1: ?
day 2: ?
day 3: ?
day 4: ?
day 5: ?
day 6: ?

The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then we know that the following cannot be true:
- The vase and the mirror are both auctioned on day 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- The harmonica is auctioned on day 2.
- The lamp is auctioned on day 1.

A: The harmonica could be auctioned on day 3, and the table on day 5. This satisfies the conditions given in the problem, so A is a possible answer.
B: This cannot be true because the table is auctioned on a later date than the lamp.
C: This cannot be true because we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. 
D: This cannot be true because we know that the vase and the mirror are not auctioned on the same date.
E: This cannot be true because the lamp has to be auctioned after the harmonica.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  - Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")  
According to the given conditions, if the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then it could be true that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The auction lasts for 6 consecutive days, from June 1st to June 6th. 
  - The items to be auctioned are: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, vase.
  - Sundial is not on June 1st.
  - If harmonica is earlier than lamp, then mirror is earlier than lamp.
  - Sundial is earlier than mirror and vase.
  - Table is earlier than harmonica or vase, but not both.

To be true:
- If the table is auctioned on a later date than both the mirror and vase, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on the first two days (June 1 and June 2). 
- The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1 or June 2, meaning that it must be auctioned on June 3, June 4 or June 5. 
- Since the table is earlier than harmonica or vase, but not both, and the lamp is already auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 6, and the vase must be auctioned on June 3 or June 4. 
- This leaves the mirror to be auctioned on June 5, which is earlier than the vase.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The antiques auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
  Let's assume that the table is auctioned on June 5th, the mirror is auctioned on June 3rd and the vase is auctioned on June 4th.
  According to the conditions, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be on June 2nd. 
  According to the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both, the harmonica must be on June 6th.
  According to the condition that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp, the lamp has to be on June 6th as well.
  Therefore, the remaining antique, the lamp, must be on June 1st.
  So, we have the following order: 
  June 1st - Lamp
  June 2nd - Sundial
  June 3rd - Mirror
  June 4th - Vase
  June 5th - Table
  June 6th - Harmonica
  It is clear from the order that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, which is the correct choice. 
  The other choices are not true because they either contradict the given conditions or can be inferred to be false from the order above.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The antique dealer auctions exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  - The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

Action: Answer("D") 

If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then it is possible that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the correct answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica should be auctioned later than the lamp for the mirror to be auctioned earlier than the lamp.
  - The sundial should be auctioned earlier than both the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned earlier than either the harmonica or the vase.

Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation: 
  - If the table is auctioned later than both the mirror and the vase, then the harmonica should be auctioned earlier than both of them.
  - If the table is auctioned earlier than the lamp, which means the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror also should be auctioned earlier than the lamp. This contradicts the given conditions.
  - The sundial should be auctioned earlier than both the mirror and the vase, so it cannot be auctioned after the table.
  - This means that the vase should be earlier than the table, and the only possible order is: sundial, mirror, vase, table, harmonica, lamp. Therefore, the mirror could be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Answer D is correct.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.

Analysis: 
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st. Because the table must be auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. Because the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, and the harmonica is not auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th. Because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and it must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. Because the mirror is auctioned later than the sundial, and it must be auctioned before the vase, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th or June 6th. Because the table must be auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, and the table is not auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  
  So, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 4th. That means the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. If the lamp is auctioned on June 5th, then the vase must be auctioned on June 6th. If the lamp is auctioned on June 6th, then the vase must be auctioned on June 5th. So, we don't know anything for sure about the order of the vase and the lamp. But we do know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The six antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and also before the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. This means that the table cannot be auctioned earlier than the mirror or the vase.
If the table is not auctioned before the vase, then the vase must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which means the sundial must be auctioned before that, but this is not possible because the sundial cannot be auctioned before the mirror and vase.
Therefore, the table must be auctioned before the vase. If the table is auctioned after the mirror, then the vase must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which is not possible. Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned after the table.
This means that the order of the antiques from the earliest to the latest auction is: 
	table, mirror, (harmonica/lamp), (harmonica/lamp), sundial, vase
So, it is possible that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, and hence option D is correct.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - Table may be auctioned on an earlier date than either Harmonica or Vase, but not both.
  - Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If Harmonica is auctioned earlier than Lamp, then Mirror is also auctioned earlier than Lamp.
  - Sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than Mirror and Vase.
Question: 
  - If the table is auctioned on a date later than both the mirror and vase, which one of the following could be true?
    - If the table is auctioned after the mirror and vase, then harmonica cannot be auctioned before the table, therefore A is not true.
    - Since table is already later than the mirror, it could be later than the table itself, therefore B is true.
    - Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and table could be auctioned on an earlier date than Sundial, therefore C is not true.
    - If the table is auctioned after the mirror and vase, then it means sundial was auctioned earlier than the table. Therefore, D could be true.
    - If Harmonica is auctioned earlier than Lamp, then Mirror is also auctioned earlier than Lamp. But, we don't know anything about whether harmonica will be auctioned before the lamp or not, therefore E is not true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, there are only two possible positions for the pharmacy: in space 1 or in space 7.
  In both cases, constraint (1) is satisfied.
  
Analysis:
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, it must be next to the veterinarian (constraint 3), which means the optometrist cannot be in space 2 (constraint 4). Therefore, A is false.
  If the pharmacy is in space 7, it must be next to the optometrist (constraint 3), which means the toy store cannot be in space 3 (constraint 4). Therefore, E is false.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5 and the pharmacy is in space 1, then space 4 must be a restaurant (constraint 2) and space 7 must be the other restaurant (constraint 1). Therefore, B and D are false and C is true.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5 and the pharmacy is in space 7, then space 2 must be a restaurant (constraint 1) and space 1 must be either the optometrist or the veterinarian (constraint 3). Therefore, A is false and B is true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the optometrist or the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian or in space 4.
  One of the restaurants must be at the end of the row.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the optometrist or the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian or in space 4. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 7. 
  One of the restaurants must be at the end of the row, and we know that the pharmacy is not at the end of the row. Thus, either the optometrist or one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row. Therefore, choices A, D, and E are not necessarily true.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and since restaurant #1 is at one end of the row and the veterinarian is in space 5, then there must be at least three distinct businesses between the veterinarian and restaurant #2. Therefore, choice C must be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are exactly seven spaces in a row.
  2. The pharmacy is at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  3. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  4. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  6. The veterinarian is in space 5.

Analysis:
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist and the veterinarian must be in spaces 2 and 3 (in some order). This would mean that the two restaurants could not be placed in spaces 4 and 6 without violating constraint 3. So the pharmacy cannot be in space 1.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 7, then one of the restaurants must be in space 1 and the other must be in space 4. This would mean that the optometrist and the veterinarian must be in spaces 2 and 3 (in some order), and the shoe store and toy store must be in spaces 5 and 6 (in some order). This arrangement is consistent with all of the constraints, so it is possible for the pharmacy to be in space 7.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 2, then the optometrist and veterinarian cannot be in spaces 1 and 3 (in some order), because this would violate constraint 4. Therefore, the only option would be to place the optometrist or veterinarian in space 1 or 3 and the other in space 4 or 6. This would mean that the two restaurants could not be placed in spaces 5 and 7 without violating constraint 3. So the pharmacy cannot be in space 2.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 3, then the optometrist and veterinarian must be in spaces 1 and 2 (in some order). This would mean that the two restaurants could not be placed in spaces 6 and 7 without violating constraint 3. So the pharmacy cannot be in space 3.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 4, then one of the restaurants must be in space 7, and the other must be in space 1 or 2 (in order to be separated from the first restaurant by at least two other businesses). This would mean that the optometrist and veterinarian must be in spaces 5 and 6 (in some order), and the shoe store and toy store must be in spaces 3 and 2 (in some order). This arrangement violates constraint 5 (the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian), so the pharmacy cannot be in space 4.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 5, then the optometrist and veterinarian must be in spaces 4 and 6 (in some order). This would mean that one of the restaurants must be in space 1, and the other must be in space 7 or 2 (in order to be separated from the first restaurant by at least two other businesses). The shoe store and the toy store must be in spaces 3 and 2 (in some order). This arrangement is consistent with all of the constraints.

  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. 
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.

Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
If the veterinarian is in space 5 and the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, there are only two possible arrangements for the restaurants: restaurant-pharmacy-restaurant or pharmacy-restaurant-restaurant. In either case, the restaurant that is not at the end must be in space 4. Therefore, C: A restaurant is in space 4 must be true.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
Analysis: 
  - The pharmacy must be at either end, and it must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - Therefore, the optometrist must be in either space 4 or space 6.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that the maximum range for the two restaurants is from space 2 to space 6. 
  - The pharmacy must be at one end, so it must be space 1 or space 7. 
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7, which violates the spacing requirement for the two restaurants. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7 and the restaurant in space 1. 
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 2 or space 6. If the toy store is in space 2, then the optometrist must be in space 4 and the shoe store in space 3. This means that the other restaurant must be in space 6, which violates the spacing requirement for the two restaurants. Therefore, the toy store must be in space 6, the optometrist in space 4, the shoe store in space 3, and the other restaurant in space 2.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 spaces in a row.
  - The pharmacy is at one end of the row.
  - One of the restaurants is at the other end of the row.
  - Two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.
  - There are seven businesses.
Analysis:
  - We know that the pharmacy must be at one end and the other restaurant at the other.
  - Therefore, we can conclude that restaurant must be in space 1 (if pharmacy is in space 7) or it must be in space 7 (if pharmacy is in space 1).
  - We know that the veterinarians is in space 5 and pharmacy must be next to either the veterinary or optometrist, this makes pharmacy either in space 4 (if veterinary is on left) or space 6 (if veterinary is on the right).
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, this means restaurant can be in space 3.
  - Toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, this means that the toy store must be in space 2 or space 4.
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, the shoe store must be in space 6.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. With the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, there are two possible arrangements of the restaurants: R _ _ R _ _ _ or _ _ _ R _ _ R. 
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, meaning the pharmacy cannot occupy either space 1 or space 7, which will be occupied by the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, meaning that the toy store cannot occupy either space 4 or space 6.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in either space 4 or space 6.
  If the two restaurants are arranged as R _ _ R _ _ _, then the shoe store must be in space 3, and if they are arranged as _ _ _ R _ _ R, the shoe store must be in space 2. 
  Thus, if the veterinarian is in space 5:
    - The shoe store must be in either space 2 or 3.
    - The pharmacy must be in either space 4 or space 6.
    - A restaurant cannot occupy space 4 since it is adjacent to the pharmacy only.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, the shoe store must be in space 6. Therefore, the shoe store is in space 6.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  We are given the following constraints for the arrangement of the businesses:
  1. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
  We are also told that the veterinarian is in space 5.

Analysis:
  Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the businesses that could be next to the veterinarian are either the pharmacy or the optometrist.
  We also know that one of the restaurants must be at one end of the row, so we can rule out choices A and E since they do not include a restaurant at the end of the row.
  We also know that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since the veterinarian is already in space 5, the other restaurant cannot be in space 6, so we can rule out choice D.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that a restaurant is in space 4, which is choice C.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, we know that the optometrist or the pharmacy is in space 4 or space 6.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be in space 4 or space 6.
  One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so it cannot be in space 4 or space 6.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in space 1, 2, 6, or 7.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, a restaurant is in space 4 must be true, as that is the only option that works with the given constraints.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven spaces (1-7), and seven businesses (optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian), with one business going in each space.
  The pharmacy must be located at one end, and one of the restaurants at the other end of the row.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other business.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, the toy store cannot be next to space 5.
  
Analysis:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, there are two possibilities for the pharmacy: space 4 or space 6. Given that the restaurant must be at the other end of the row, there are only two possibilities for the restaurant: space 1 or space 7. If the restaurant is in space 1, then the optometrist must occupy space 2, and the pharmacy occupies space 4. If the restaurant is in space 7, then the pharmacy must occupy space 6, and the optometrist must occupy space 4. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses, a restaurant cannot occupy space 4. The business occupying space 3 cannot be the toy store, because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the only possible answer is:

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Three rugs will be woven using 5 out of 6 available colors.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - Rugs can be solid or multicolored.
  - If white is used in a rug, two other colors are also used in the rug.
  - If olive is used in a rug, peach is also used in the rug.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Let's evaluate each option:
A: There could be multicolored rugs with forest, just not multicolored rugs where forest and turquoise are used together.
B: Turquoise cannot be used in a rug with peach, but it could still be used in a multicolored rug with other colors.
C: This could be true since peach is required in a rug if olive is used and there must be at least one rug with olive.
D: Turquoise cannot be used in a rug with peach. This means turquoise can only be used in a multicolored rug where neither peach nor yellow is used.
E: Yellow can only be used in a multicolored rug where neither peach nor turquoise is used.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysing each option:
  A: There could be a multicolored rug with forest color and four other colors. So this statement is not always true.
  B: Turquoise cannot be used with forest, peach, turquoise, and yellow colors. So if a multicolored rug is being made, there is no option of using turquoise in that rug. Thus, this statement must be true.
  C: Peach must be used in every rug in which olive is used because it is given in the context that in any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. So peach is used in at least one of the rugs. This statement must be true.
  D: Turquoise cannot be used with forest, peach, turquoise, and yellow colors. We are not sure whether a rug can be made using only turquoise color, but we know that turquoise alone cannot be used in a multicolored rug. So this statement may or may not be true.
  E: We are not sure whether the yellow color is used or not. So this statement may or may not be true.

Action: Answer("BC")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Six colors of thread are available - forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  - Three rugs will be woven.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Action: Answer("C")  
According to the rules, Peach is used in one of the rugs in which olive is used too. Since peach is used in only one rug, it must be used in a multicolored rug, because any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. Therefore, Peach is used in a multicolored rug.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The problem describes three rugs being woven, each using five of the six available colors of thread—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—where each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs can either be solid colored or multicolored. There are certain rules to which the rugs must adhere.
  A: There is no information that indicates whether forest is used in any of the rugs, and there is no information that says forest cannot be used in a multicolored rug. Thus, (A) cannot be determined from the information provided.
  B: The rules state that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug and that peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. There are five colors used in each rug, so if forest, peach, and white were used in one rug, and olive and yellow were in another rug, it would not be possible for turquoise to be used in the final rug without violating these rules. Thus, (B) must be true.
  C: The rules do not require the use of peach in any rug, but they also do not prohibit its use. Thus, (C) could be true, but it is not necessarily true.
  D: The rule states that turquoise cannot be used with forest, peach, or yellow. Given that each rug must use five colors, it is possible that in the three rugs, turquoise may not be used at all. Thus, (D) could be true, but it is not necessarily true.
  E: The rules do not require the use of yellow in any rug, but they also do not prohibit its use. Thus, (E) could be true, but it is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are 6 colors of thread: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
- Exactly 5 of the 6 colors will be used to weave the rugs.
- Each color can only be used in one rug.
- White is always with two other colors.
- Olive always with peach.
- Forest and Turquoise are not used together.
- Peach and Turquoise are not used together.
- Peach and Yellow are not used together.

A: It could be possible to use forest, so A is not true.
B: It is possible to use turquoise, so B is not true.
C: Peach is always used in the rugs, so C is true.
D: There are no rules preventing the use of Turquoise, so D is not necessarily true.
E: Yellow and Peach are not used together, so E is not true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  We are to weave three rugs from 5 distinct colors- forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, yellow. 
  Each rug must have 3 colors and must be either solid or multicolored. 
  Some colors cannot be used together, or with certain other colors. 
  The given rules are:
  1. In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. 
  2. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  3. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. 
  4. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  5. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

A: Forest can be used in a rug. It is not necessary that only solid rugs are woven and thus, forest can be a color in a multicolored rug. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true. 
B: Turquoise and forest are not used together, that is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that there can be no multicolored rugs with turquoise, or that there cannot be any solid rugs with turquoise. 
C: If peach is used in any of the three rugs, then we must use olive as well. Further, peach cannot be used with turquoise. Thus, if peach is used, it must be used with forest, white, yellow, or olive. So, in any of the three rugs, if peach is used, then it can be only be used in a multicolored rug where olive is also used. So, this choice is necessarily true as it is a restriction on the use of colors. 
D: Turquoise cannot be used with peach, and it cannot be used with forest. However, there is no rule that prevents us from using turquoise with white or yellow. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true. 
E: Yellow can be used in a rug. It is not necessary that only solid rugs are woven and thus, yellow can be a color in a multicolored rug. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The rules state that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - The rules state that peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - The rules state that peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - There are exactly six colors available and each rug is comprised of exactly five of them.
  
Analysis:
  - Choice A is not necessarily true, because forest could be used in a multicolored rug with four other colors.
  - Choice B is a possible inference based on the rules, but it is not necessarily true.
  - Choice C is true because one of the rules states that in any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used and each color is used only once.
  - Choice D is not necessarily true because turquoise could be used in a solid-colored rug or in a multicolored rug with four other colors.
  - Choice E is not necessarily true, because yellow could be left out of all the rugs or used only in one of the solid-colored rugs.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  We need to weave 3 rugs with 5 of the 6 available colors: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Each color is used only once.
  White should be used with 2 other colors.
  If olive is used, then peach must also be used.
  Forest and turquoise cannot be used together.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together.
  Peach and yellow cannot be used together.

Analysis:
  Option A is not necessarily true, since we may use forest in one of the multicolored rugs.
  Option B is a possible conclusion, since turquoise should not be used with forest, and it cannot be used with peach as well.
  Option C is a definite conclusion, since peach must be used in one of the rugs if olive is used.
  Option D is not necessarily true, since turquoise cannot be used in multicolored rugs that will also include forest, peach, or yellow.
  Option E is not necessarily true, since yellow can be used if it is not used in the same rug with peach.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the three rugs.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - White will be used in any rug where two other colors are used.
  - Olive will be used with peach.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis:
  - It is possible that forest will be used in a multicolored rug.
  - It is possible that turquoise will be used in a multicolored rug where peach is not used.
  - Peach's usage is guaranteed according to one of the rules.
  - Turquoise's usage is not guaranteed.
  - Yellow's usage is not guaranteed.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are 6 available thread colors.
  Three rugs will be woven, with either solid or multicolored design.
  Each rug must use exactly 5 thread colors.
  Each color used will only be used in one rug.
  In any rug with white, two other colors are used.
  Olive and peach are always used together.
  Forest and turquoise can't be used together.
  Peach and turquoise can't be used together.
  Peach and yellow can't be used together.

Elimination:
  A: There are no restrictions on forest being used, so this could be true but not necessarily.
  B: Turquoise can only be used with certain colors, but it is not completely forbidden, so this could be true but not necessarily.
  C: Peach is always used with olive, so this must be true.
  D: There is a restriction on turquoise being used with certain colors, so this could be true but not necessarily.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Four art historians (Farley, Garcia, Holden, Jiang) will give a series of four public lectures, each on a different topic (lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors).
- The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different topic.
- The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

A: Farley can't give the lithographs lecture because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, A can't be true.
B: Garcia can give the sculptures lecture because nothing in the constraints prohibits it. Therefore, B can be true.
C: Garcia can't give the watercolors lecture because the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture, and Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, C can't be true.
D: Holden can give the oil paintings lecture because nothing in the constraints prohibits it. Therefore, D can be true.
E: Jiang can't give the watercolors lecture because Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, E can't be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics (lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors).
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

The only option that violates the constraints is option A, because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. So, if Farley gave the lithographs lecture, then his lecture would have to be later than the oil paintings lecture, which violates the constraints. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Four art historians (Farley, Garcia, Holden and Jiang) will give a series of four public lectures on different topics (lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors).
- The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different topic.
- Constraints:
   - oil painting and watercolors lectures both have to be earlier than lithographs lecture
   - Farley's lecture has to be earlier than oil paintings lecture
   - Holden's lecture has to be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.
  
A, B, C, D, or E could be false based on given constraints. 

A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
- If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must both be earlier than his lecture, which violates the constraint that Farley's lecture has to be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. This could be false.

B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
- This could be true as there's no constraint violated by this arrangement.

C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
- This could be true as long as both oil paintings and watercolors lectures are given earlier than the lithographs lecture, and Holdon's lecture is earlier than Garcia's lecture.

D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
- If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then the watercolors lecture has to be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which means Garcia's lecture also has to be earlier than oil paintings lecture. But according to the constraint, Holdon's lecture has to be earlier than both Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.
So this cannot be true.

E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
- This could be true as long as Farley gives the lithographs lecture and the oil paintings lecture is given earlier than the lithographs lecture.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are four lectures, each on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each art historian gives a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. 

Analysis:
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings and watercolors lectures would have to both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. This is possible, so choice A could be true.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, this is possible. 
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, the oil paintings and watercolors lectures would both have to be earlier than the lithographs lecture, which contradicts a given constraint. Therefore, choice C cannot be true.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Garcia’s and Jiang’s lectures would have to be after the oil paintings lecture, which would violate the given constraints. Therefore, choice D cannot be true.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden’s lecture would have to be earlier than both Garcia’s and Jiang’s lectures, and since Garcia’s lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture, this would violate the given constraints. Therefore, choice E cannot be true.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures, each on a different topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian will give a lecture on a different topic, and the lectures will be given one at a time.
  - The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: 
        1. The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. 
        2. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. 
        3. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
        
A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, it is not possible for him to give the lithographs lecture after the oil paintings lecture, making this choice possible. 

B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
- We don't have any constraints that prevent Garcia from giving the sculptures lecture. This choice is possible.

C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, if Holden's lecture is on oil paintings, then both Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be on watercolors or sculptures. Making this choice possible. 

D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, we can't have Holden give the oil paintings lecture before Farley, making this choice impossible.

E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, if Holden's lecture is on oil paintings, then both Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be on watercolors or sculptures. Making this choice possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The series of lectures will cover four topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each art historian will give a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  The lectures will be given one at a time.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

Analysis:
  We can use the constraints given to eliminate some of the scenarios.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then Holden must give the oil paintings lecture, and Garcia and Jiang must give the watercolors and sculptures lectures in some order. This satisfies all of the constraints, so it is a valid scenario.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden must give the watercolors or oil paintings lecture, and Farley and Jiang must give the other two lectures in some order. This satisfies all of the constraints, so it is a valid scenario.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden cannot give the oil paintings lecture (because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's), so Holden must give the sculptures lecture. This means that Farley and Jiang must give the lithographs and oil paintings lectures in some order. This satisfies all of the constraints, so it is a valid scenario.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley must give an earlier lecture and Jiang must give a later lecture. This means that Garcia must give either the watercolors or sculptures lecture. Either way, all of the constraints are satisfied, so this is a valid scenario.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley must give an earlier lecture and the oil paintings lecture must be given by either Holden or Garcia. This means that Garcia must give the sculptures lecture, so Jiang's lecture will be the last one, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, this scenario is not valid.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
 We know that:
 - Each artist gives only one lecture.
 - Four lectures will be given on four different topics.
 - Lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors are the topics discussed.
 - There are some constraints on the scheduling that must be taken into account.
 - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
 - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
 - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

A: If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then Farley's lecture would have to be last, which contradicts the fact that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Thus, this choice is not feasible.
B: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the only remaining lecture available is watercolors. However, that would make Jiang the only one to give the lithographs lecture, which contradicts the fact that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Thus, this choice is not feasible.
C: If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then the only remaining lecture available is sculptures. This makes Holden's lecture the oil paintings lecture, but it doesn't violate any of the given constraints. Thus, this choice is feasible.
D: If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley must give the first lecture, which contradicts the fact that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Thus, this choice is not feasible.
E: If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley must give the first lecture, Holden must give the second lecture as oil paintings, and Garcia must give the third lecture as sculptures. This would contradict the fact that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Thus, this choice is not feasible.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Four art historians will give four public lectures, one lecture per person and topic.
  - The topics are lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - The schedule must follow:
    * Oil and watercolors lectures before lithographs lecture.
    * Farley before oil lecture.
    * Holden before Garcia and Jiang. 
    
A: If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then she/he would have to give the last lecture which violates the rule that the oil and watercolors lectures must be before the lithographs lecture. Therefore, A is not true.
B: According to the constraints, the sculptures lecture can be given by either Garcia, Holden, or Jiang. Therefore, B can be true.
C: According to the constraints, Garcia can give the watercolors lecture since it is not Holden's lecture. Therefore, C can be true.
D: According to the constraints, Holden can give the oil paintings lecture since it is before both Garcia's and Jiang's lectures. Therefore, D can be true.
E: According to the constraints, Jiang can give the watercolors lecture since it is not Holden's lecture. Therefore, E can be true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Four art historians will give four public lectures on different topics.
  Lectures will be given one at a time.
  Each historian will give a lecture on a different topic.
  There are four topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Constraints: 
    1. Oil paintings and watercolors must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    2. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    3. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
    
A: Farley giving the lithographs lecture violates constraint 1.
B: Garcia giving the sculptures lecture is valid and does not violate any constraint.
C: Garcia giving the watercolors lecture is valid and does not violate any constraint.
D: Holden giving the oil paintings lecture violates constraint 2.
E: Jiang giving the watercolors lecture is valid and does not violate any constraint.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There is a series of four lectures, each lecture on a different topic.
  - Lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different topic.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

A: Farley cannot give the lithographs lecture because Farley must speak before the oil paintings lecture, and the oil paintings lecture must happen before the lithographs lecture. Therefore, Farley can only give the first or second lecture.

B: Garcia can give the sculptures lecture, as there are no restrictions against it.

C: Garcia cannot give the watercolors lecture because if Holden's lecture is earlier than Garcia's lecture, and Holden's lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture, then Garcia cannot give the watercolor lecture after Holden.

D: Holden can give the oil paintings lecture, but he cannot give the watercolor or lithograph lecture because he must give his lecture before Jiang and Garcia, respectively.

E: Jiang cannot give the watercolors lecture because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z) that need to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating T from W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation:
  - Since Z is mentioned in chapter 7, R, S, T, U, W, and X must be mentioned in chapters 1 through 6, and we need to find a possible location for S.
  - From the constraints:
      - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be either in chapter 2, 3, or 4.
      - T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating them. So T cannot be in chapter 2, because then W would have to be in chapter 5, which violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, T must be either in chapter 3 or 4, with W following in a chapter exactly two steps away.
      - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Since Z is in chapter 7, S must be either in chapter 3 or in chapter 5.
      - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Since W is at least two chapters away from T, the only possible positions for W are chapter 5 or 6. If W is in chapter 5, then X must be in chapter 7, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W must be in chapter 6, which means X must be in chapter 5.
  - Therefore, the possible order of clues is: 
      Chapter 1: U
      Chapter 2: R
      Chapter 3: T
      Chapter 4: W
      Chapter 5: X
      Chapter 6: S
      Chapter 7: Z
  - This means that S could be mentioned in chapter 3, which is choice B.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - Chapter 1 through chapter 7 are used.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W.
  - There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Analysis:
  - Since Z is mentioned in chapter 7, we know that S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. 
  - Also, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 7, because T must be mentioned before W.
  - Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or earlier.
  - Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, or 4.
  - Since there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, W must be mentioned in chapter 7, 6, or 5.
  - Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, X cannot be mentioned in chapter 7, so X must be mentioned in chapter 6 or earlier.
  - Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, U must be mentioned in chapter 5 or earlier.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
  - X is mentioned in chapter 5 is possible because X must be mentioned in chapter 6 or earlier, but cannot be in chapter 7 because W is mentioned in chapter 7 and W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. 
  - None of the other choices satisfy all the constraints given.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The order of the clues in the novel must satisfy the following conditions:
    - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
    - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
    - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W cannot be in chapter 7 because of the requirement that S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. This is possible because R can be mentioned in any of the first three chapters, and Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3. This is not possible because Z cannot be in chapter 6 if S is in chapter 3.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4. This is possible because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1. This is not possible because X must be adjacent to U, and X cannot be in chapter 2 (because W cannot be in chapter 3 if T is in chapter 1), which means U cannot be in chapter 1.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5. This is not possible because X must be adjacent to U, and U cannot be in chapter 6 (because W cannot be in chapter 5 if T is in chapter 1), which means X cannot be in chapter 5.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, Z.
- Each clue appears in exactly one chapter, from chapter 1 through chapter 7.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
- T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- Z is mentioned in chapter 7.

Analysis: 
- If Z is in chapter 7, then S cannot be in chapter 6.
- Also, since T comes before W with two chapters separating them, then T can be in either chapters 2 or 3 and W can be in either chapters 5 or 6. 
- X must come after U. Therefore, since Z is in chapter 7, then X must be in chapter 6 and U must be in chapter 5.
- Then, T can only be in chapter 2 because it must appear before W.
- Therefore, S cannot be in chapter 3, since T is already in that chapter.
- R must be in chapter 3 and S must be in chapter 4.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The seven clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each of them will be mentioned once, one per chapter.
  T is not in chapter 1.
  T must be before W and there must be exactly two chapters between them.
  S and Z can't be adjacent.
  W and X can't be adjacent.
  U and X must be adjacent.

Let's test each option:
A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T cannot be mentioned before W since there are only two chapters between them. Therefore, this option is not possible.
B: If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then T has to be in chapter 2 and W in chapter 5. This satisfies all requirements. Therefore, this option is possible.
C: If T is in chapter 4, then W and X would have to be in chapters 6 and 7 (in either order), which violates the rule that W and X can't be adjacent. Therefore, this option is not possible.
D: If U is in chapter 1, then X has to be in chapter 2, which violates the rule that U and X must be adjacent. Therefore, this option is not possible.
E: If X is in chapter 5, then U has to be in chapter 4 and W has to be in chapter 7. This satisfies all requirements. Therefore, this option is possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The novel consists of seven chapters, with seven different clues each appearing exactly once.
  - There are several constraints that determine the order of the clues:
    - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
    - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
    - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then R, S, T, U, W, and X must be mentioned in the other six chapters in some order.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then T cannot be in chapter 7 since it must appear before W with two chapters in between. R and S cannot appear in chapter 7 since they cannot be adjacent to Z. Since T cannot be in chapter 1, it must be in either chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If U and X must be adjacent, then U must be in chapter 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. If U is in chapter 1, then X must be in chapter 2, which is not allowed since W cannot be adjacent to X. If U is in chapter 2, then X must be in chapter 3, which is not allowed since S cannot be adjacent to Z. If U is in chapter 4, then X must be in chapter 5, which satisfies all constraints. Therefore, X is mentioned in chapter 5 and the only possible answer is E.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The novel consists of 7 chapters that must contain clues R, S, T, U, W, X, Z exactly once per chapter.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1. 
  - T must be before W, and T must be separated by exactly two chapters from W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then:
  - Neither S nor X can be in Chapter 6.
  - Chapter 6 must contain U and X clues.
  - W must be mentioned in either chapter 5 or chapter 6.
  - Chapter 4 can only contain clues T or S.
  - Neither T nor W can be in chapter 1.
  
Options:
  A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then W will have to be in chapter 5, and X will have to be in chapter 6. Thus Z cannot be in chapter 7, so this option is not possible.
  B: If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then neither R nor T can be in chapter 1. If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be in chapter 6, and U and X must be in chapter 7. Therefore Z cannot be in chapter 7, so this option is not possible.
  C: If T is in chapter 4, then R must be in chapter 1 or 2. If R is in chapter 1, then X must be in chapter 3, and therefore W cannot be in chapter 5. If R is in chapter 2, then X must be in chapter 4, and therefore U must be in chapter 5. This leaves W with chapter 6, and Z must be in chapter 7. This is possible, so the answer is C.
  D: If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be in chapter 2, W must be in chapter 3 or 4, and T must be in chapter 5 or 6. However, since Z can't be adjacent to S, T, or W, Z cannot be in chapter 7. Therefore this option is not possible.
  E: If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be in chapter 6, and W must be in chapter 7. In this scenario, Chapter 3 or 4 must contain clue T, leaving no chapter for R or S. Therefore this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  A mystery novel is planned with seven chapters and seven clues must be mentioned exactly once.
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  T cannot be in chapter 1 and have to be mentioned before W.
  There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?
Knowledge: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then we know that Z is not adjacent with S, and there are no clues to be mentioned in chapter 6. 
  Option A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, T will be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, which means W will be in chapter 4 or 6, then X will be at chapter 5 or 7, therefore the adjacent chapter of X will be either chapter 4 or 6. So, A is not possible.
  Option B: If S is mentioned in chapter 3, T will be in chapter 2 or 4, which means W will be in chapter 4 or 6, then X will be at chapter 5 or 7. So, T cannot be two chapters away from W. Therefore, B is not possible.
  Option C: It's possible for T to be in chapter 4, then U will be in chapter 5, which means X will be in chapter 6, and W in chapter 7. Thus, C is a possible answer.
  Option D: If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which means T will be in chapter 3, then W will be in chapter 5, and Z will no longer be in chapter 7. Thus, D is not possible.
  Option E: If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be in chapter 4, which means T will be in chapter 3, then W will be in chapter 6, and Z will no longer be in chapter 7. Thus, E is not possible.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are 7 chapters and 7 clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  We are told that Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
  
Analysis:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W must be mentioned either in chapter 5 or 6, and T must be mentioned before W, this leaves only chapters 2 and 3 for T, and since T cannot be in chapter 1, then T is mentioned in chapter 2.
  According to the clues, U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, which means U is mentioned either in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  
  A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S and Z should be in chapter 2 and 4 respectively. But S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so this is not possible.
  B: If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then T should be in chapter 2 and Z should be in chapter 4. But S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so this is not possible.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 2.
  D: U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 because T is already mentioned in chapter 2 and T must be before W, which means U is either in chapter 4 or 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 6 and U is mentioned in chapter 4.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  Each chapter must contain exactly one clue.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W.
  There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Approach: 
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then we know that T and W cannot be mentioned in chapters 6 and 7 (since T must be mentioned before W with two chapters in between).
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in either chapter 4 or chapter 5.
  From there, we can use the given constraints to eliminate options and determine which of the remaining options could be true.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or chapter 8, according to the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in either chapter 3 or chapter 5. However, if S is mentioned in chapter 5, then W and X must be mentioned in chapters 6 and 7 (since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters). This contradicts the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 3. This means that R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 5. Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 (according to the given constraint), U must be mentioned in chapter 2, and X must be mentioned in chapter 3. This leaves T to be mentioned in chapter 4, which is consistent with the given constraints. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that S is mentioned in chapter 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Yoshio is not assigned to the project.

Using the negation of Yoshio's assignment, we can work through each option to see which one could be true:
  A: Louis not being assigned wouldn't allow for anyone to be assigned to 1923, so this is not possible.
  B: If Ryan is not assigned, then Onyx can't be assigned, which means no one could be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which conflicts with a given rule.
  C: If Tiffany is not assigned, then Ryan does not have to be assigned, which is compatible with the rules.
  D: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan would have to be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany to 1924, which is compatible with the rules.
  E: If Louis is assigned to 1924, then no one could be assigned to 1923, which conflicts with a given rule.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project consists of four years that must be assigned to four different students.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project.  Since there are four years, only one student will not be assigned to the project. Therefore, Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany will all be assigned to the project.
  From the given conditions, we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must also be assigned.  Therefore, we can assume that Tiffany and Ryan are assigned to the project.  From the condition that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, we can conclude that Onyx must be assigned to 1922, and Ryan must be assigned to 1924.  Since Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, Mollie must be assigned to 1921. This leaves Louis to be assigned to 1923.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")  
Since Yoshio not being assigned to the project leaves no possibility for any of the given choices to be true, the answer is "None of the above."
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Each year must have exactly one student assigned to it.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, only five students are available for assignment.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Yoshio is not assigned to the project and there are only five students available, then only one of the following must be true: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, or Tiffany is not assigned to the project. Among these, it is possible for Onyx to be assigned to 1922, since the only requirement for Onyx's assignment is that it must be in the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, (D) Onyx is assigned to 1922 could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The project requires assigning four students to four different years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  Six students are available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922 if she is assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then five students (Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany) are available for the four project slots. 

Analysis:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, the remaining three years must be assigned to the other four students (including Tiffany or Louis for 1923).
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, the remaining two years must be assigned to the other three students (including either Louis or Onyx for 1923).
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which means Onyx will be assigned to 1922. Therefore, the remaining two years must be assigned to the other three students (including either Louis or Tiffany for 1923).
  
  Since Yoshio is not assigned to the project, he is not relevant to the remaining possible scenarios. 
  We have three possible scenarios:
  1) If Mollie is assigned to the project, then the four years can be assigned to Louis, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  2) If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then the four years can be assigned to Louis, Onyx, Ryan, and Mollie.
  3) If Ryan is assigned to the project, then the four years can be assigned to Louis, Mollie, Onyx, and Tiffany.
  
Conclusion: 
  Therefore, Onyx can be assigned to 1922, as in (2) and (3).
  Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  We want to know which statement could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  There are six students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.

Analysis: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, we can eliminate Yoshio from the list of available students:
  Available students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany. 
  From the four years assigned to the project, only 1923 has restrictions on who can be assigned to it, and it can only be assigned to Louis or Tiffany, which means that:
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  From this point, we have various possibilities, but we need to find one that could be true, so:
  - Tiffany must be assigned to the project if Louis is not assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923.
  - If Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany must be assigned to the four given years.
  Under these conditions, we can see that it is possible for each of the answer choices A, B, C, D and E to be true except for answer choice E. If Louis is assigned to 1924, then there is no year left for Mollie to be assigned to, because she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  2. If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  3. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  4. If Ryan is assigned to the project, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  5. Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Reasoning:
  By condition 1, either Louis or Tiffany has to be assigned to 1923. 
  By condition 3, if Tiffany is assigned, Ryan has to be assigned. But then by condition 4, Onyx has to be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. 
  If Ryan is not assigned, then condition 4 is not violated, and Louis can be assigned to 1923. 
  If Mollie is not assigned, then we can avoid the requirement in condition 2, and any of the four years can be assigned to the four students. 
  Therefore, it is possible for any of the options A, B, C, D, or E to be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Action: Answer("ABCDE")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  Six students are available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  Each of the four years (1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924) will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the remaining five students should be assigned to the four years according to the given conditions.
  We know that Tiffany and Louis cannot be assigned to the same year, and only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to either 1921, 1922, or 1924.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, one of the remaining students must be assigned to 1924.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, Ryan cannot be assigned to the project.
  Finally, if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if Ryan is not assigned to the project, Onyx can be assigned to any of the four years.

Action: Answer("A")  
Louis is not assigned to the project.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be five students available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.

Options A, B, and C cannot be true because:
  - If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there won't be any student who can be assigned to 1923. 
  - If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx won't be able to be assigned to a year since he must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then there won't be any student who can be assigned to 1923.

Option E cannot be true because Louis cannot be assigned to 1924 since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.

Option D could be true because Onyx can be assigned to 1922, which is the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 4 years which must be assigned to exactly one student each.
  - Each student can only be assigned to one year.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
Process of elimination:
  - A cannot be true because if Louis is not assigned to the project and Yoshio is also not assigned to the project, then there will be only 4 students available but there are 4 years to be assigned, so Louis must be assigned.
  - B cannot be true because if Ryan is not assigned to the project, and Yoshio is also not assigned to the project, then there will be only 5 students available for 4 years which is impossible.
  - C can be true. There are enough students to cover all years without assigning Tiffany to the project.
  - D cannot be true because if Onyx is assigned to 1922, then it implies that Ryan must be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany to 1924; but Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923 if Yoshio is not in the project because only Tiffany or Louis can be assigned to 1923.
  - E cannot be true because Yoshio is not assigned to the project which means Louis must be assigned to a year, and Louis cannot be assigned to 1924 because only Tiffany or Louis can be assigned to 1923.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Six students are available for the project.
  Each year from 1921 to 1924 should be assigned to exactly one student.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the assignment.
  We can try to assign the four years to the available students and see if any of the choices could be true.
  Let's start by assigning Mollie to 1921 and see where that leads us.
  - Mollie is assigned to 1921, so Tiffany and Yoshio can't be assigned to 1921.
  - Tiffany can only be assigned to 1923, so Louis can't be assigned to 1923.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. So, Onyx must be assigned to 1922, and Ryan to 1924. Therefore, Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  We have assigned all four years to the available students, and we see that Ryan is not assigned to the project. Therefore, **Choice (B) Ryan is not assigned to the project** could be true in this scenario.

  The first and second houses are shown during the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth during the afternoon, and the sixth and seventh in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Elimination:
According to the given rules, the order for showing the 7 houses can only be like the following:
1. one of {K, L, M, N, 0, P} should be shown first in the morning as K cannot be shown later.
2. one of {K, L, M, N, 0, P} should be shown second in the morning.
3. one of {K, L, M, N, 0, P} should be shown third in the afternoon.
4. one of {K, L, M, N, 0, P} should be shown fourth in the afternoon.
5. one of {K, L, M, N, 0, P} should be shown fifth in the afternoon.
6. one of {K, L, M, N, 0, P} will be shown sixth in the evening.
7. J must be shown seventh in the evening.
 
A: K cannot be shown later, so K cannot be the 6th house. L must be shown before M, so L cannot be shown after M. And J must be shown last, so J cannot be in any other position. So, this order doesn't satisfy the given rules.
B: L must be shown between K and M, so L can't be fourth and M can't be the second. This order doesn't satisfy the given rules.
C: This order satisfies all the given rules.
D: 0 and P are shown before M, but L must be shown before M. So, this order doesn't satisfy the given rules.
E: J must be shown last, so J cannot be shown in any other position. This order doesn't satisfy the given rules.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The realtor is showing seven houses according to the rules and restrictions provided:
    1. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
    2. The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
    3. The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
    4. J must be shown in the evening.
    5. K cannot be shown in the morning.
    6. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
    
Analysis:
  From the given options, we have to choose the order that fulfills all the given conditions.
  Option A:
    K is shown first in the morning, which is not allowed because K cannot be shown in the morning.
  Option B:
    L is shown third in the afternoon, which satisfies the condition L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
    J is shown last in the evening, which satisfies the condition J must be shown in the evening.
    The order satisfies all the given conditions (1-6), so the answer is B.
  Option C:
    Neither K nor L is shown in the afternoon, which contradicts the condition.
  Option D: 
    L is shown after M, which contradicts the condition L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Option E:
    J is shown in the evening, which satisfies the condition J must be shown in the evening.
    K is shown in the morning, which contradicts the condition K cannot be shown in the morning.
    The order does not satisfy all the given conditions.
    
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:

  The realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. 
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. 
  J must be shown in the evening. 
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
  Analysis:
  From the rules, we know that:
  - J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
  - K cannot be shown in the morning, so K cannot be 1st or 2nd.
  - L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. This limits the possible positions for both K and L.
  - The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, and the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. This limits the possible positions for J, K, 0, and P.
  - N can be shown at any time, so it doesn't provide much information.
  
  Possible orders considering the above rules are:
  - 6th: J, 7th: P, morning: (K, 0), afternoon: (L, M, N) or (M, L, N)
  - 6th: P, 7th: J, morning: (K, 0), afternoon: (L, M, N) or (M, L, N)
  
  Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day according to specific rules.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Elimination:
Option A is incorrect because it shows J in the last and not in the evening.
Option B is incorrect because it shows N before L, whereas L should be shown before N.
Option C is incorrect because it shows L after N, whereas L should be shown before N.
Option D is incorrect because it shows M before L, whereas L should be shown before M.
Option E is correct as it shows the houses in the order as required by the rules.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  J will be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown after K and before M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  
Elimination:
  Choice A: K is the first house shown which is not allowed.
  Choice B: N is shown first, which is in the morning and L is shown second which violates the rule that L should be shown after K.
  Choice C: The order starts with 0, and K is shown in the afternoon which is allowed. However, L is shown later which violates the rule that L should be shown at some time after K.
  Choice D: The order starts with 0, and K is shown in the afternoon which is allowed. L is shown after K and before M which is allowed. J is shown in the evening which is allowed. So, this could be the correct order.
  Choice E: P is shown first which is in the morning which is not allowed.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses in the following order:
  1. First and second houses in the morning.

  J must be shown in the evening, so it must be either the sixth or seventh house. 
  K cannot be shown in the morning. 
  L must be shown after K and before M.
  A, B, C, and D have at least one violation of the rules.
  
Analysis:
  A: Incorrect. J is the last to be shown and should be in the evening. No violations, but J is not the last. 
  B: Incorrect. J must be the last to be shown and should be in the evening. Violation: J is not shown last. 
  C: Incorrect. Violations: K is shown last in the morning. L is shown before K. 
  D: Incorrect. Violation: L is not shown between K and M.
  E: Correct. No violations. J is shown last in the evening, K is not shown in the morning, and L is shown between K and M.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day following certain rules:
    - First and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
    - Third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
    - Sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
    - J must be shown in the evening.
    - K cannot be shown in the morning.
    - L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: 
  From the rules, we know that J must be shown in the evening, and K cannot be shown in the morning, which means K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. Since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, we have these possibilities: 

  - K, L, M
  - L, K, M
  - K, M, L

  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, and K cannot be shown in the morning, hence the first two houses cannot be K. Therefore, K must be the third, sixth, or seventh house to be shown. Since J must be shown in the evening and there are only two houses left, either P or 0 must be the other house shown in the evening. Therefore, J and the other remaining house must be the sixth and seventh houses to be shown. 

  Therefore, the order from first through seventh in which the realtor shows the houses could be P, 0, K, J, L, N, M. Choice E is the only option that matches this order.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses in a single day.
  The first and second houses are in the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth houses are in the afternoon, and the sixth and seventh houses are in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Elimination:
  We can eliminate option A since J must be shown in the evening.
  We can eliminate option C since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, but K and L are not together in this order.
  We can eliminate option D since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, but K and L are not together in this order.
  We can eliminate option E since J must be shown in the evening.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. M cannot be published in the same season as P.
  2. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.

To satisfy (1) and (2), M must be paired with O in the fall.

If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall (3). Since K and N must be published in the same season as each other (4), N must also be published in the fall. Therefore, the pair that could both be published in the fall along with M are O and N.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  - If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring, not in the fall.
  - So, we need to find the single pair of cookbooks that can be published in the fall along with M.
  - If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. But, we don't know if K is going to be published in the fall or not. So, we can't guarantee this pair of cookbooks.
  - L can be published in either fall or spring, so L can be paired with M in the fall.
  - 0 can be paired with M in the fall if K is also going to be published in the fall.
  - P cannot be published in the fall because M is already going to be published in the fall.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Thus, K and O must be published in the fall.
  We have two possible scenarios: 
    M and K are published in the fall: In this scenario, the pair of cookbooks that could be published in the fall along with M are (O and L).
    M is published in the fall and O is published in the fall: In this scenario, the pair of cookbooks that could be published in the fall along with M are (K and L).

Action: Answer("A") 
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  
Elimination:
  If M is published in the fall, we know that N cannot be published in the fall.
  Based on K and N's condition, we know that if N is published in the spring, K must also be published in the spring.
  Since K and N must be published in the same season, and we already know that N cannot be published in the fall, K also cannot be published in the fall if N is not published in the fall.
  Since O must also be published in the same season as K if K is published in the fall, O also cannot be published in the fall.
  Possible choices are L, M and P. Since M and P cannot be in the same season, we can eliminate P.
  Therefore, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could be both published in the fall along with M is L and O.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  K and N should be published in the same season.
  M and P can not be published in the same season.
  
To satisfy all the conditions above, the following combinations are possible:
  - K, N, and O in the fall; L, M, and P in the spring
  - L, M, N, and O in the fall; K and P in the spring
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  If M is published in the fall and N must be published in the spring, the only cookbook that can be published in the fall along with M is O. Therefore, the possible pairs of cookbooks that could be published in the fall are (K, O) or (L, O). So, the answer is C.
Response 5:
If M is published in the fall and N must be published in the spring, then M and N cannot both be published in the fall. Likewise, since M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other, P cannot be published in the fall. Therefore, the only possible pairing is K and O, which must be both published in the fall if K is published in the fall.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1- M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2- K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3- If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4- If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

Since M is published in the fall, according to condition 4, N must be published in spring. Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall. Since K and N must be published in the same season, they must be published in the fall too. Therefore, L and P must be published in the spring. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  
Solution: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring which means K and O must be published in the fall. Since K and N must be published in the same season, we can deduce that K, N, and O must be published in the fall. Therefore, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is L and P.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - M cannot be published in the same season as P
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
  - If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall
  - K and N must be published in the same season as each other
  
  Based on the above conditions of the cookbook publishing:
  
  - If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, which means K and O must be published in the fall.
  
  So the set of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is {K, O}.
  
  A: K must be published in the fall if O is published in the fall and vice versa, therefore, it cannot be K and O together that are published in the fall with M.
  B: L cannot be published in the fall along with M since if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  C: L cannot be published in the fall along with M.
  D: P cannot be published in the fall along with M.
  E: O must be published in the fall along with K.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Analysis:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring (by 4). Therefore, K and N must be published in the same season (by 2). This means K and O must be published in the fall (by 3). So, the only option is (A) K and O, which can both be published in the fall along with M.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  If S is performed fourth, compositions that are performed before S must be O, and at least one of F or R.
  The eighth composition performed must be either L or H.
  
Analysis:
  According to the given conditions, we can determine that composition O needs to be performed either first or fifth. If S is performed fourth, it means that O must be the first composition to be performed. As per the given conditions, next composition must be P performed before S, and F or R must be performed after O and before S. This means either F or R has to be performed second. The third composition now must be either F or R, which is not performed second, and the only option that satisfies this condition is T. Thus, the accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, is O, F or R, P.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 compositions that will be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time: F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T.
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least 2 compositions are performed between F and R.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

Action: 
If S is performed fourth, then:
- P (which is performed before S) must be performed first, second or third.
- Therefore, the compositions that can be performed first, second and third are any of the ones that can come before P:
  - O can be performed first.
  - L or H (eighth composition) can't be performed yet.
  - F and R must each have at least two compositions performed between them, so they can't be performed right after S.
  - That leaves H or L, S, and either T or F as the compositions that can be performed after S (in positions 5, 6, and 7).
- From the options, the only one that fits these conditions is D: O, P, T. 

Therefore, the answer is D. Answer("D").
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then we can deduce:
   - O must be performed first. 
   - Either F or R must be performed fifth. Thus, T must be performed right after F or right before R.
   - Since P must be performed before S, and S is performed fourth, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
   
  A: F, H, P -> If P is performed third, then S would have to be performed fifth or later, which violates one of the conditions.
  B: H, P. L -> If P is performed first, then O would have to be performed fifth, but H or L must be performed eighth. If P is performed second, then O would have to be performed fifth, so H or L must go sixth or seventh, which contradicts one of the conditions. If P is performed third, then S would have to be performed fifth or later, which violates one of the conditions.
  C: O, P, R -> If P is performed first, then S would have to be performed fifth or later, which violates one of the conditions. If P is performed second, then S would have to be performed fifth or later, which violates one of the conditions. If P is performed third, then F and T would have to be performed back to back, which violates one of the conditions.
  D: O, P, T -> This is a possible order, since T can be performed right after P and right before F.
  E: P, R, T -> If P is performed first, then O would have to be performed fifth, but H or L must be performed eighth. If P is performed second, then O would have to be performed fifth, so H or L must go sixth or seventh, which contradicts one of the conditions. If P is performed third, then F and T would have to be performed back to back, which violates one of the conditions.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The compositions should be performed exactly once each and consecutively.
  - The order of performance should satisfy the conditions:
    - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
    - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R or after R and before F.
    - O is performed either first or fifth.
    - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
    - P is performed at some time before S.
    - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the possible orders of the first three compositions are limited by the following:
  - One of the compositions O, P, or R should be performed first.
  - If O is performed first, then P can not be performed second. However, if P is performed first, then O or R can be performed second.
  - If R is performed first, then F and T must be performed right after R and before P and S.
  - If P or R is performed first, then L or H must be performed third.
  
  A: F, H, P - F or H must be performed fourth.
  B: H, P, L - H or P must be performed first. L must be performed third.
  C: O, P, R - Possible order. O is performed first, P is performed second, and R is performed third.
  D: O, P, T - T can not be performed third if P is performed second.
  E: P, R, T - R must be performed first. P should be before S, so it can not be performed second.
  
  Therefore, the answer is C: O, P, R.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  3. O is performed either first or fifth.
  4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  5. P is performed at some time before S.
  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

Solution:
Option A violates condition 1 because F is first.
Option B violates condition 3 and condition 4 because H, L, and P is a possible order for first, second, and third, which means H is not the eighth composition as it is mentioned in condition 4 and O can not be the first as it is mentioned in condition 3.
Option C violates condition 1 because R is third.
Option D is correct according to all the conditions mentioned above. 
Option E violates condition 1 because T is third. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The eight compositions are F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then the first three compositions and their order of performance must satisfy the six given conditions.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is either the first or fifth composition played, and P must be played before S. 
  Also, given that at least two compositions are played between F and R in either order, either F or R is played second or third. 
  Now, there are only a few compositions left that can be played first, second, and third.
  
Analysis:
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second and R must be performed third. However, this does not satisfy the condition that either F or R is immediately before or after T, since the performance order is O, P, R, and T cannot be either immediately before or after R.
  
  If P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth. Since only one composition can be performed between S and O, R must be performed second and H must be performed third to satisfy the condition that either L or H is the eighth composition. This composition order of P, R, and H satisfies all the given conditions.
  
  Using the same logic as above, the composition order of F, R, and T also satisfies all the given conditions.
  
Elimination:
  A: F, H, P - does not satisfy the condition that either F or R is immediately before or after T.
  B: H, P, L - does not satisfy the condition that S is performed fourth.
  C: O, P, R - does not satisfy the condition that either F or R is immediately before or after T.
  D: O, P, T - does not satisfy the condition that either F or R is immediately before or after T.
  E: P, R, T - satisfies all the given conditions and is a possible composition order if S is performed fourth.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The compositions ordered consecutively, and one at a time.
  - The order of performance must satisfy the following conditions:
    - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
    - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
    - O is performed either first or fifth.
    - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
    - P is performed at some time before S.
    - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  - We need to find an accurate list of the compositions that could be performed first, second, and third respectively if S is performed fourth.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
We know that S is performed fourth. Therefore either O or P must be the one performed first. However, since O can only be performed first or fifth, and P must be performed before S, the only option is P to be performed first. 
Since P is performed first and S is performed fourth, we know that R and F must be performed second and third, respectively. Because P is performed before S, H and L must be performed last. Therefore, the possible accurate list of compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively is O, P, T (D)
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The order of performance of 8 compositions F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T needs to satisfy multiple conditions.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  We are given that S is performed fourth and we need to find the possible order of performance of the first 3 compositions.
  
Analysis:
  If S is performed fourth, then the possible order of performance of compositions O, P and T is 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively.
  From the given conditions:
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  If O is performed first, then P should be performed after O and before S. So, P cannot be performed first or second. If P is performed third, then T must be performed first, F must be performed second and R must be performed fourth. In this case, L and H can be performed in either sixth or seventh position. So, Option B and E are possible.
  If O is performed fifth, then S must be performed sixth. So, P cannot be performed first or second, it must be performed third. Then, T must be performed first, F must be performed second and R must be performed fourth. In this case, H and L cannot be performed in the eighth position. So, Option D is possible.
  Option A and C are not possible because they have either F or R as the first composition, which cannot be determined from the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("B") or Answer("E") or Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - At least two compositions must be performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  
Since S is performed fourth, according to the condition that P is performed before S, we can deduce that either O or T must be played first since O is either first or fifth. If O is played first, then P will be played second and one of the compositions F or R will be played third. If T is played first, then one of the compositions F or R will be played second, followed by P and then the other of the compositions F or R will be played fourth. 
Since L or H must be performed last, according to the given condition, there are only two possible combinations that could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively:
- O, P, R 
- T, F, P

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The order of compositions must satisfy the following conditions:
  1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  3. O is performed either first or fifth.
  4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  5. P is performed at some time before S.
  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
S is performed fourth. Therefore, we know that P must be performed before S. So, the possible compositions that could be performed before S are O, P, R, F, or T. By the fifth condition, P must be performed before S. So, the possible compositions that could be performed before P are O, R, F, or T. Since the eighth composition is either L or H, the possible compositions that could be performed after S are L, H, O, R, F, or T.

A: F, H, P
If F is performed fifth, then P must be performed sixth and H must be performed seventh. This would leave L and T as the only options for composition eight, but L and T do not satisfy the given conditions. Thus, A is not a possible answer.

B: H, P. L
If P is performed second, then O must be performed first and R must be performed third. Since S is performed fourth, T must be performed immediately after S. The remaining compositions must be F, and either L or H. This satisfies all of the given conditions, so B could be the correct answer.

C: O, P, R
If P is performed second, then H and L cannot be composition eight. Thus, C is not a possible answer.

D: O, P, T
If P is performed second, then O must be performed first and R must be performed third. Since S is performed fourth, F must be performed fifth and T must be performed sixth. This leaves H and L as the only options for composition eight, but H and L do not satisfy the given conditions. Thus, D is not a possible answer.

E: P, R, T
If P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth or F must be performed fifth. If O is performed fifth, then R must be performed second. This leaves H and L as the only options for composition eight, but H and L do not satisfy the given conditions. If F is performed fifth, then T must be performed sixth and H or L must be performed eighth. This satisfies all of the given conditions, so E could be the correct answer.

Answer: Answer("B") or Answer("E") could be the correct answer, depending on the compositions that are performed after S and before the eighth composition.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively.
  Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
To find the answer, we need to use the given conditions to infer the possible locations for each type of cargo. Then, we can determine which cargo cannot be located in bay 4.

Possible locations for each type of cargo are as follows:
  - Fuel: bay 1, 2, or 3
  - Grain: bay 5 or 6
  - Livestock: bay 3 or 4
  - Machinery: bay 1, 2, or 3
  - Produce: bay 4 or 5
  - Textiles: bay 2 or 3
  
If textiles is in bay 2, produce must be in bay 3 and fuel must be in bay 1. This would mean that grain, livestock, and machinery must occupy bays 4, 5, and 6 in some order. Since livestock has a higher number than textiles, it cannot be in bay 4. Therefore, livestock cannot be the type of cargo held in bay 4. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The six bays are numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  - The six types of cargo are fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  - According to the given rules, bay holding grain must have higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - And bay holding livestock must have higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - Bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - Therefore, we can say that the order of bays from left to right is as follows: fuel, produce, textiles, machinery, livestock, grain.
  - Thus, the cargo which CANNOT be held in bay 4 is 'B: Livestock'.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 through 6 are numbered consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  There are exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, bay 5 or 6 holds grain, and bay 4 holds livestock or textile.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, bay 4 holds textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, bay 5 holds produce.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Therefore, bay 3 and 4 hold textiles and livestock respectively.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: Based on the given information, bay 4 cannot hold produce. Therefore, D: produce CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly six bays at the loading dock numbered consecutively from 1 through 6.
  - There are exactly six types of cargo at the loading dock: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Analysis:
  - From the rules, we can determine the following order:
    fuel < produce < textiles < livestock < grain < machinery
  - According to the rules, the type of cargo held in the bay 4 must be one of produce, textiles, or livestock.
  - Therefore, machinery cannot be the type of cargo held in bay 4.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  2. Exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles—are being held.
  3. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  4. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  5. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  6. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Analysis: 
  Bay 4 is not holding the cargo that shares the same adjacent bays, which are Textiles and Produce. Therefore, A, B, D and E could be the type of cargo held in bay 4. We need more information to determine if machinery could be held in bay 4. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  We know that the bays are numbered 1 through 6 consecutively.
  We also know that there are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  From the given statements, we know that:
    - Grain is in a higher numbered bay than livestock.
    - Livestock is in a higher numbered bay than textiles.
    - Produce is in a higher numbered bay than fuel.
    - Textiles is next to (either before or after) produce.
    
  We need to find a cargo type that cannot be in bay 4.
  
Analysis:
  If we start with choice A, we are given that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Since bay 4 is in the middle, grain, which has a higher bay number, cannot be held in it. Therefore, A cannot be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
  If we move to choice B, it says that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Since textiles is in a higher numbered bay than livestock, livestock cannot be held in bay 4. Therefore, B cannot be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
  If we move to choice C, it can be held in bay 4 since there are no constraints on machinery.
  If we move to choice D, it says that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Since produce is in a higher numbered bay than fuel, fuel cannot be held in bay 4. Therefore, D cannot be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
  If we move to choice E, we are given that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Therefore, it is possible for textiles to be in bay 4 because it is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
There are six bays numbered from 1 to 6, and six different types of cargo. Each bay holds a different type of cargo and the bays and cargo have specific relationships based on their order. Specifically, the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, and the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. 

Bay 4 is not holding livestock because it has to be at a lower number bay than grain. Bay 4 is next to the bay holding produce, so it can not hold fuel, which has to be in a bay lower than the bay holding produce. Bay 3 is holding textiles because it has to be next to produce and has to be lower in number than livestock. 
Knowledge suggests that, bay 4 cannot hold any of the cargos in B, D, and E because machinery has to be in a higher number than textiles. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six types of cargo, and each bay holds a different type of cargo.
  - Bay numbers are consecutive from 1 to 6.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
To determine the answer, we need to check which of the given options would violate the given rules for the bay numbers and cargo types.

Option A: grain
  - If grain is in bay 1, then livestock would be in bay 2 and textiles in bay 3, which satisfies the rules. So, this is a possible option.
Option B: livestock
  - If livestock is in bay 1, then textiles would be in bay 2, which violates the rule that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. So, this cannot be the correct option.
Option C: machinery
  - If machinery is in bay 1, then livestock would be in bay 2, textiles in bay 3, and produce in bay 5. In this case, bay 4 must hold fuel, which also satisfies the rules. So, this is a possible option.
Option D: produce
  - If produce is in bay 1, then fuel would be in bay 2, textiles in bay 3, and livestock in bay 4 which violates the rule that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. So, this cannot be the correct option.
Option E: textiles
  - If textiles is in bay 1, then produce would be in bay 2, fuel in bay 3, livestock in bay 4, and grain in bay 6, which satisfies the rules. So, this is also a possible option.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is B: livestock. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Six bays numbered 1 through 6 contain exactly one type each of six different cargo types: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Step-by-step analysis:
  - If bay 5 holds produce, then bay 6 must hold textiles; since bay 4 is next to bay 6, it cannot hold textiles and therefore cannot hold produce. 
  - If bay 5 holds textiles, then bay 6 must hold produce.  If bay 4 cannot hold produce, it cannot hold fuel either since produce and fuel are separated by one bay and bay 3 already has a specific cargo type.
  - In any other case, the cargo types could potentially fit in bay 4.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  According to the given, six bays numbered 1 through 6 are consecutively from one side of the dock to the other, each holding exactly one of the six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. There are five rules: 
  1) The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  2) The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  3) The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  4) The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  5) Each bay holds a different type of cargo.
  
  A: Bay 5 or 6 can be holding grain because according to rule 1, the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and there are two bays left. 
  B: Bay 1 or 2 can be holding livestock because according to rule 1, The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, and there are two bays left. 
  C: Bay 3 can be holding machinery because we don't have any rules about it, and five other types have already been assigned to the other bays. 
  D: Bay 6 can't be holding produce because the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce (rule 4). 
  E: Bay 5 can't be holding textiles because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock (rule 1).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are four walls; two paintings are displayed on each of the walls, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  Each of the four art students display two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.  
  Now, if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which means wall 1 or wall 2 has both paintings by Franz and Greene.

Let's analyze each option:
  A: There is no condition or rule that relates the position of Greene's oil with Franz's watercolor. So, this option is not necessarily true.
  B: We know that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in the lower position of Wall 4, and no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, this option is not true.
  C: There is no condition or rule that relates the position of Hidalgo's oil with Franz's watercolor. So, this option is not necessarily true.
  D: We know that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in the lower position of Wall 4, so, Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. Therefore, this option is not true.
  E: We know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of Wall 4. If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in the upper position on the same wall, then Isaacs's paintings are both on the same wall (Wall 4). No wall can have only watercolors. Thus, the upper position on Wall 4 must have Isaacs's oil (because there is no wall with only watercolors) and hence Isaacs's watercolor must be in the lower position. Therefore, this option is true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall must have exactly one oil and one watercolor.
  2. None of the walls can have only watercolors.
  3. None of the walls can have works from only one artist.

From the given information, we know that:
   - Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor are on the same wall.
   - Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4.
   - No wall can have works from both Franz and Isaacs.
   
If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we can deduce that:
   - On that wall, Greene's watercolor and Franz's oil must be in the other positions.
   - Therefore, Franz's watercolor must be on a different wall than where his oil is.
   - Isaacs's oil is already placed in wall 4, so it can't be on the same wall as Franz's watercolor.
   - Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor because that would violate the condition that no wall can have works from only one artist.
   
Therefore, we can deduce that Hidalgo's oil is on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.

Action: Answer("D").
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Every wall has one oil and one watercolor painting.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.

  Notice that because of the distribution of Isaacs's oil, walls 1, 2, and 3 must satisfy all the previously mentioned conditions except the one regarding Isaacs and his oil.
  
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, it means that wall 2 (the only wall with paintings by both Franz and Greene) cannot include both the oil and the watercolor of both students. Otherwise, either Hidalgo or Isaacs must have a wall to themselves, violating condition 2. Therefore, either the wall features the oil paintings of both students or the watercolor paintings of both students. This means that in wall 2, Hidalgo and Isaacs each have one painting. Either one of them has an oil in an upper position, or one of them has a watercolor in an upper position.
  
  A: Greene's oil could be displayed on either wall 1 or 3, not necessarily in an upper position. Incorrect.
  B: There is no information that supports this statement. Incorrect.
  C: There is no information that supports this statement. Incorrect.
  D: This statement could be true. If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, wall 1 must contain both oils. Therefore, in wall 1, either Hidalgo or Isaacs must have an oil in an upper position. Correct.
  E: This statement might or might not be true. Insufficient information. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are four art students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student displays two paintings, an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings are displayed on each of the walls (1, 2, 3, and 4).
  One painting is in the upper position and one in the lower position on each wall.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both Franz's and Isaacs's paintings displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the same wall as Franz's oil.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")  
If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. This is because if Hidalgo's oil were displayed in a lower position, then Isaacs's oil (which must be displayed in a lower position on wall 4) would be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, violating the rule that no wall has both Franz's and Isaacs's paintings displayed on it. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. Thus, (C) is the correct answer.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  3. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  5. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that:
  1. Wall 1, 3, and 4 are already occupied with other paintings, so it must be Wall 2 where Franz's watercolor and Greene's oil are displayed.
  2. Since Franz's watercolor is already in the lower position on Wall 2, then Greene's oil must be in the upper position of Wall 2.
  
Following from the above, we also know that:
  3. Wall 1 has Isaacs's oil in the lower position and is already occupied with other paintings. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil cannot be on Wall 1.
  4. Wall 3 has another painting of Franz and is already occupied with other paintings. Therefore, neither Hidalgo's oil nor Hidalgo's watercolor can be on Wall 3.
  5. Wall 4 has Isaacs's watercolor in the lower position and is already occupied with other paintings. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil cannot be on Wall 4, and Isaacs's watercolor is already in the lower position.
  
This leaves only Wall 1 as a possible location for Hidalgo's watercolor. Therefore, we can conclude that:
  Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Each of the 4 walls has exactly 2 paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Hidalgo must display one oil painting and one watercolor painting on the wall with Isaacs's oil painting. Thus, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position, since Isaacs's oil is in the lower position. Therefore, the correct answer is (C): Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
- Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students who will each display exactly two paintings - an oil and a watercolor.
- Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("C")
If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then:
- Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
- Isaacs's oil is in the lower position on wall 4, so Isaacs cannot be on the same wall as Franz and Greene
- Therefore, Hidalgo must be on the same wall as Isaacs (and not Franz and Greene), and the only painting of Hidalgo that can be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil is Hidalgo's oil.
- Since Hidalgo has an oil painting, it cannot be the case that Hidalgo's wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position.
- Therefore, the correct answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  * Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students displaying two paintings each.
  * Each wall has exactly two paintings in upper and lower positions.
  * No wall has only watercolors or works of only one student.
  * No wall has Franz and Isaacs works together.
  * Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  * Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
To find the answer, we need to use the given information and make some deductions:
  * According to the given information, if Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the same wall.
  * Therefore, if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then it must be displayed in the lower position of the same wall.
  * If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then that wall would have only watercolors, which is not allowed.
  * From the given information, we cannot determine the position of Hidalgo's oil or watercolor, but we know that they cannot both be on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  * We also cannot determine the position of Isaacs's watercolor, but we know that his oil is in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  4 students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) display 2 paintings (oil and watercolor each).
  2 paintings (oil and watercolor) are displayed on each of the walls 1,2,3,4.
  One painting in the upper position and one in the lower position of each wall.
  No wall has only watercolors.
  No wall has the work of only one student.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
  Greene's watercolor is in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, we need to find out what must be true.

Solution:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's oil and Franz's oil must be on the same wall. 
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  The wall with lower position oil painting of Franz also has the upper position watercolor of Greene. This means Franz's other painting, i.e. watercolor, must be on a different wall.
  Moreover, this also means Isaacs's oil, because Isaacs and Franz cannot be on the same wall, must be on a different wall.
  Wall 4 already has Isaacs's oil in the lower position. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be on a different wall, and Hidalgo's paintings must be on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. 
  Additionally, we know that no wall has only watercolors, so Hidalgo's oil must be in the upper position and his watercolor in the lower position.

Answer: 
  According to the given information and solution mentioned above, if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position (Choice A). Hence, the answer is A.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Each wall has two paintings - an oil and watercolor - in different positions.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor will also be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  
Action: Answer("D")   
If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor will also be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil. This means that if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil in order to satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. Answer D is the only option that states Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.

Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be
Choices:
  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant
  B: the pharmacy and the toy store
  C: the two restaurants
  D: a restaurant and the toy store
  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven spaces in a row where seven different businesses will be located, subject to several constraints.
  The pharmacy and the restaurant must be at opposite ends of the row.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be located next to the veterinarian.
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, it will leave one space on either side of this pair.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 businesses that must be located in a straight row shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be:
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation:
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, they will occupy two spaces in a straight line.
  - There are only two possible locations for the optometrist, either next to the pharmacy or next to the veterinarian.
  - In either case, the pharmacy or the veterinarian will occupy a space adjacent to the optometrist-shoe store pair.
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it must be adjacent to the pharmacy. 
  - This leaves two spaces, which must be occupied by the two restaurants, with at least two businesses between them. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair must be a restaurant and the toy store, which is represented by choice D.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 spaces in the shopping center arranged in a straight row.
  - 7 businesses - an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian - will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, we can deduce that the following businesses are immediately on either side of this pair:
    -- The optometrist cannot be next to the pharmacy or the veterinarian based on the given constraints.
    -- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be immediately next to the optometrist and the shoe store.
    -- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be immediately next to the optometrist and the shoe store.
    -- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be immediately next to the optometrist and the shoe store.
    -- That leaves only one possible combination of businesses that can be immediately next to the optometrist and the shoe store: the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- There are 7 spaces available in the shopping center: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7.
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row: either space 1 or space 7.
- One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row: either space 1 or space 7.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
- If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist and the shoe store must take up two consecutive spaces, and no other business can be between them.
- Therefore, the possible arrangements of the businesses are:
  1. Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe store - Toy store - Veterinarian - Restaurant 1 - Restaurant 2
  2. Pharmacy - Veterinarian - Shoe store - Optometrist - Toy store - Restaurant 1 - Restaurant 2

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are seven businesses: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian. They must be located in one of the seven spaces in a straight row.
- The pharmacy must be at one end, and one of the restaurants at the other end.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 2 and 3.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
- If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, they must be in either spaces 2 and 3 or spaces 6 and 7.

Action: Answer("D")  
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store in spaces 2 and 3, then space 1 must be the pharmacy, space 4 must be one of the restaurants, space 5 cannot be the toy store because it must be separated from the veterinarian, and space 6 must be the other restaurant. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are a restaurant (space 4) and the toy store (space 5). The answer is D.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The optometrist must be next to the shoe store, but we don't know where they are located in the row.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, but not next to the toy store.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses and one of them must be at the other end of the row from the pharmacy.
  Based on the rules, we can try to deduce some possible locations for each business:
  - Pharmacy: space 1 or space 7
  - One of the restaurants: space 1 or space 7
  - The other restaurant: somewhere in the middle (not next to the pharmacy or the first restaurant)
  - Optometrist: next to the shoe store
  - Veterinarian: next to the pharmacy (if the pharmacy is at space 1) or next to the second restaurant (if the pharmacy is at space 7)
  - Toy store: somewhere in the middle (not next to the veterinarian)
Action: Answer("B")  
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are only two possible ways to arrange them: 
```
1. Shoe store - Optometrist - X - X - X - X - Pharmacy
2. Pharmacy - X - X - X - X - Optometrist - Shoe store
```
In both cases, the pharmacy is next to the optometrist and away from the shoe store, which satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and the toy store. The answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants must be at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the shoe store cannot be at the end of row and the optometrist must be in an even-numbered space (between spaces 2 and 6).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. There are seven spaces in a straight row and seven businesses that will be located, one in each space.
  2. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  3. One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row.
  4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  5. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  6. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  7. The optometrist is next to the shoe store.

Since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are only three possible business locations adjacent to them: the pharmacy, the toy store, or the veterinarian. 

However, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be adjacent to the optometrist and the shoe store. So, the pharmacy must be adjacent to the veterinarian and the optometrist must be adjacent to the shoe store.

Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and the veterinarian. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then there are two possible arrangements:
  S O _ _ _ _ P or P _ _ _ _ _ O S, where S is the shoe store, O is the optometrist, and P is the pharmacy.

Analysis:
  In the first possible arrangement, the pharmacy is at the other end of the row, so it cannot be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the only option for the business immediately to the left of the shoe store is the pharmacy, and the only option for the business immediately to the right of the optometrist is a restaurant. Since there are two restaurants and they must be separated by at least two other businesses, the only valid arrangement is S O P R T V, where R is a restaurant, T is the toy store, and V is the veterinarian.
  
  In the second possible arrangement, the pharmacy is next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the other restaurant is at the other end of the row. Therefore, the only option for the business immediately to the left of the shoe store is the pharmacy, and the only option for the business immediately to the right of the optometrist is the other restaurant. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the only valid arrangement is P S O R T V, where R is a restaurant, T is the toy store, and V is the veterinarian.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, they will occupy two adjacent spaces.
  
Solution:
  - According to the constraints, the pharmacy must occupy either space 1 or space 7 and a restaurant must occupy the opposite end. In this case, there is only one restaurant left to be placed, which must be in one of the spaces between 2-5.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, they will occupy two adjacent spaces, so these spaces must be one of the following sequences: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, or 6-7.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the optometrist is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 and the veterinarian must be in space 3. Therefore, the adjacent spaces to the optometrist-shoe store pair are space 1 and space 3. Hence the answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - There are three batches made of each type of cookie.
  - Each batch is made from start to finish on a single day and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then all other weekdays have 2 batches each.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: If there is only one batch made on Friday, then there must be 2 batches of cookies made on each of the other days. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday. This means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. So, the answer is E.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each of the three kinds of cookie (oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar) has three batches made each week.
  2. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  3. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  4. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  5. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 3, we know that at least one batch is made on Monday, which means only two possibilities for Monday:
    a. There is only one batch made on Monday.
    b. There are two batches made on Monday.
  If we assume that Monday has only one batch, then the latest day for the third batch is Thursday. 
  In this case, option A, option B, and option D are impossible, option C is possible but not guaranteed, and option E is possible. 
  If we assume that Monday has two batches, then there are no batches of cookies that can be made on Wednesday. 
  In this case, option C is impossible, option D and option E are impossible because they require Wednesday for their batches, and option A is possible but not guaranteed, and option B is possible but not guaranteed. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. 
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, we know that one of the three batch types must have been made on Friday.
  
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. This means that no sugar cookies were made on Thursday or Friday, and since there are only three batches of sugar cookies made each week, all the sugar cookies must have been made on Tuesday and Wednesday. However, this would mean that either the second batch of sugar cookies was made on Monday, which contradicts the problem conditions, or that one of the sugar cookie batches was made on the same day as another batch of sugar cookies, which is also not allowed. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday. If none of the cookies were made on Monday, then the first batch of each type must have been made on Tuesday. Then, the second batch of peanut butter cookies was made on Tuesday as well, which means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Monday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must have been made on Wednesday. The third batch of oatmeal cookies had to be made on Thursday, which would leave the second batch of sugar cookies to be made on Friday. Thus, this option is possible.
  
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first two batches must have been made on Monday and Wednesday. Since the first batch of each type must be on a different day from the second and third batches of the same type, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday. The second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday or Wednesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first two batches of each type must have been made on Monday and Tuesday. The first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday. The second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Wednesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday. Then, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday or Wednesday. The third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday, which satisfies the condition that only one batch was made on Friday. Thus, this option is possible.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  2. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. 
  3. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
  4. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
  5. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

For the number of batches made on Friday to be one, we know that:
  - One batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.
  - Two batches of sugar cookies must have already been made (one made on a day other than Thursday).
  - Two batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies have been made (and one of each must have been made on Thursday).

A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
    It is impossible for this statement to be true since the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on a day other than Monday.
B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
    If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday and the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday. This is possible, so this could be true.
C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
    It is impossible for this statement to be true since all three batches of oatmeal cookies would have had to be made before Friday.
D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
    If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday. This is possible, so this could be true.
E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
    If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday. This is impossible since the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Each week, there are three batches of each kind of cookie made.
  - There are five days of the week (Monday through Friday).
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then two batches of cookies are made on either Wednesday or Thursday.

Elimination:
- A: The first batch of sugar cookies can't be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. Eliminate A.
- B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies can't be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Eliminate B.
- C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies can't be made on Friday because there are only three batches of each kind of cookie made each week. Eliminate C.
- D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies can't be made on Wednesday because two batches of cookies are made on either Wednesday or Thursday. Eliminate D.
- E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies can't be made on Tuesday because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Eliminate E.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
- Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
- No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
- At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
- Since the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, no oatmeal or peanut butter cookies are made on Friday. Thus, there are two possible batches made on Friday: the third batch of sugar cookies or the third batch of oatmeal cookies.
- A: The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and that batch cannot be a second batch of sugar cookies since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
- B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because no oatmeal cookies are made on Friday.
- D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and no more peanut butter cookies are made for the rest of the week. Therefore, it is possible for the third batch of oatmeal cookies to be made on Friday.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Three kinds of cookies are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  According to the given conditions, every day of the week, batches of all three kinds of cookies are produced, so a batch of cookies must be produced on Friday, even if it is only one batch. Therefore, A and B are incorrect as they both suggest that no batches of cookies are made on Tuesday or Wednesday. D is also incorrect because no peanut butter cookies could be made on Wednesday since the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies. E is incorrect because the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies, so it could not be made on Tuesday. Therefore, the only answer choice that could be true is C, which states that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  Each batch is made from start to finish on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If the total number of batches made on Friday is exactly 1, then the remaining batches must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
Action: Answer("D")  
Reasoning: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies was made on any day before Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on some day later than the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This is not allowed according to the rules. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Wednesday. The remaining batches of oatmeal cookies must have been made on Thursday and Friday. The first batch of sugar cookies must have been made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must have been made on Thursday. The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because that would force the second batch of peanut butter cookies to be made on Tuesday as well, which is not allowed. The only remaining option is that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. Thus, the correct choice is D) The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The bakery makes exactly 3 kinds of cookies and 3 batches of each cookie are made each week from Monday through Friday. 
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. 
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. 
  If only one batch is made on Friday, then there are a total of 14 batches made in a week.
  
Analysis: 
  If only one batch is made on Friday then there will be 2 batches of the same cookie that are made on the same day. There are a total of 14 batches, so there must be two days where two batches of the same cookie are made. Using the given information we can eliminate options A, B, and D. Option C is also not possible because no oatmeal cookies are made on Friday. Option E is the only remaining choice, but we need to verify if it is possible. If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Wednesday, leaving Friday for the only batch of oatmeal cookies. Finally, the third batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Thursday, leaving Friday for the first batch of sugar cookies. Therefore, it is possible that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.

Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?
Choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
  C: the sci-fi film, the western

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not on screen 3.

  The horror and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screen 2 shows two movies at 7 P.M. and 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows only one movie at 8 P.M.
  
Analysis:
  According to the given conditions, the sci-fi film will not be shown on screen 2. Hence, choices A, B, and C can be ruled out as they all include the sci-fi movie to be shown on screen 2. Considering the remaining options, D and E, both of them can be possible because the western can be shown on screen 2 either at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M. and similarly, the horror film and mystery can also be shown on screen 2 at either 7 P.M. or 9 P.M.

  The horror movie and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M., then it means that the horror movie and the mystery must be shown on screen 1 and screen 3, but this is contradictory to the fact that the sci-fi movie is not shown on screen 3 and the horror movie and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, Option B (the sci-fi film, the mystery) cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
Response 3:

Let's check each option:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film

    - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, so it has to be on screen 1 or 2.
    - The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 with the romance, so it has to be show on screen 1 with the romance.
    - Therefore, option A is possible.
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
    - Screen 1 or 2 must have the horror film and the romance.
    - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, so it has to be on screen 1 or 2.
    - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, the mystery cannot be shown on screen 2 with the sci-fi film.
    - Therefore, option B is not possible.
  C: the sci-fi film, the western
    - Screen 1 or 2 must have the horror film, the mystery and the romance.
    - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, so it has to be on screen 1 or 2.
    - The western begins at some time before the horror film does, meaning it cannot be shown on screen 2, which starts movie at 7 P.M.
    - Therefore, option C is not possible.
  D: the western, the horror film
    - Screen 1 or 2 must have the sci-fi film, the mystery and the romance.
    - The western begins at some time before the horror film does, meaning it can only be shown on screen 1, which starts movie at 7 P.M.

The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is at space 4, then there are two businesses on its left and four businesses to its right.
  
Analysis:
  If the pharmacy is located at space 1, then it must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. Neither the toy store nor the shoe store can be next to the veterinarian, so the optometrist must be at space 2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, which means the second restaurant must be at space 5 or 6. Since the pharmacy is at space 1, the other restaurant must be at space 7. That leaves spaces 3 and 4 for the toy store and shoe store, which means the shoe store is indeed at space 4. Therefore, the optometrist is at space 2, the pharmacy is at space 1, the two restaurants are at spaces 5 and 7, respectively, the toy store is at space 3, and the veterinarian is at space 6. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
- The shoe store is in space 4.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: If the shoe store is in space 4, then we know that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7, in some order. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the only possible arrangement is Restaurant-Pharmacy-Optometrist-Veterinarian-Toy Store-Shoe Store-Restaurant. Note that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist cannot be in space 2 and the veterinarian cannot be in space 6. Therefore, the only possible arrangement for the optometrist and veterinarian is Optometrist-Pharmacy-Veterinarian. Finally, we know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, which means that the only possible location for the toy store is space 5. Thus, we have the following arrangement:
Restaurant-Pharmacy-Optometrist-Veterinarian-Toy Store-Shoe Store-Restaurant.
So, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, which means that choice B is true.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces, numbered 1 through 7.
  - There are seven businesses: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or space 7) and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Analysis:
  - The pharmacy must be located either at space 1 or space 7, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and one of them must be at the end of the row opposite the pharmacy.
  - If the toy store is adjacent to the shoe store or the veterinarian, there would be a violation of the constraints.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 businesses in the shopping center, and each business occupies a unique space numbered 1 to 7.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, and the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, then it follows that either the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 3 or space 5. This means that the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7 to be adjacent to the optometrist or veterinarian. Since the pharmacy cannot be at the opposite end of the row from the restaurant, the pharmacy must be in space 1, and the restaurant must be in space 7. From this, we can conclude that the veterinarian must be in space 3, which means that the toy store cannot be in space 2 or space 4, but it must be in space 6. Therefore, the shoe store is not next to the toy store, and it is not next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. The only option that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - A shopping center has 7 spaces and 7 businesses are to be located.
  - The pharmacy must be at one of the ends of the row and a restaurant must be at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is located in space 4.

Action: Answer("B") 

If the shoe store is in space 4, then we know that the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or 7, so the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the shoe store is in space 4, the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or 5. Therefore the only option where the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian is if the pharmacy is located in space 3 and the veterinarian is in space 2 or in space 6 and the veterinarian is in space 5. So, the only valid option is the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  We know that the shopping center has exactly 7 spaces and 7 businesses that need to be located in the shopping center.
  The pharmacy must occupy one of the first or last spaces. 
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is located in space 4, we can derive additional information about the placement of other businesses in the shopping center.

Analysis:
  To satisfy the constraints, the pharmacy must be located at either end of the row. Thus, there are two possible configurations of businesses based on whether the pharmacy is located in space 1 or space 7. If the pharmacy is located at space 1, then the veterinarian must be located at space 2 or the optometrist must be located at space 2, whereas if the pharmacy is located at space 7, then the veterinarian must be located at space 6 or the optometrist must be located at space 6. However, in any case, the shoe store must be next to one of the restaurants and not next to the toy store. 

Action: Answer("D") - The shoe store is next to the toy store (Based on the constraints, none of the other options must be true)
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The shoe store is in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: Since the shoe store is in space 4, the only places the Pharmacy can be located at is either space 1 or space 7. Therefore, the restaurant must be located at the opposite end, i.e. space 7 or space 1 respectively. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Hence the only possible businesses that can be between the two restaurants are the optometrist and the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be next to space 1 or space 7. So, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Now, since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it has to be next to one of the restaurants. Therefore, the optometrist must be next to the other restaurant. Thus, the optometrist is next to a restaurant. Hence, the answer is A.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The pharmacy has to be in one of the ends and has to be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. One of the restaurants also has to be in one of the ends. The two restaurants have to be separated by at least two other businesses. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
If the shoe store is in space 4, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 3 or space 5.
Analysis:
If the optometrist or veterinarian is in space 3, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 and one of the restaurants must be in space 7. Since the two restaurants have to be separated by at least two other businesses, the toy store cannot be in space 2 or space 6. Therefore, the toy store must be in space 7, which means a restaurant must be in space 6. This satisfies all the constraints and options B, C, D, and E are false.
If the optometrist or veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in space 7 and one of the restaurant must be in space 1. Again, since the two restaurants have to be separated by at least two other businesses, the toy store cannot be in space 2 or space 6. Therefore, the toy store must be in space 1, which means a restaurant must be in space 2. This also satisfies all the constraints.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row.
  - Seven different businesses will occupy the spaces: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

If the shoe store is in space 4, then:
  - Spaces 1 and 7 must be the pharmacy and one of the restaurants, in some order.
  - One of the restaurants must be in either space 2 or 6.
  - The other businesses can be arranged as optometrist-veterinarian-toy store or toy store-veterinarian-optometrist in spaces 3, 5, and 6 or 2, 3, and 5, respectively.
  - If the optometrist is in space 3 and the pharmacy is in space 1, then the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Therefore, Answer B is the correct choice.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 spaces in a row in the shopping center.
  - 7 businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - Constraints:
      - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
      - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
      - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
      - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If the shoe store is in space 4, then we know that neither the pharmacy nor a restaurant can be in space 1 or 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 2 or 6. Since the pharmacy cannot be next to the toy store, the only space left for the veterinarian is space 3. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. Hence, the correct answer is B.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the colors of those two rugs CANNOT be
Choices:
  A: forest and peach
  B: forest and yellow
  C: peach and turquoise
  D: peach and yellow
  E: turquoise and yellow
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find a combination of colors that cannot form a solid rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. Hence, no solid rug can have white as its color.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Hence, no solid rug can have both forest and turquoise as its color.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Hence, no solid rug can have both peach and turquoise as its color.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug. Hence, no solid rug can have both peach and yellow as its color.
  
Analysis:
  The two solid rugs can have two different combinations of colors. 
  One combination could be that they both have forest and turquoise as their colors, but that is not allowed by the rule that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. 
  Hence, we can conclude that option A, which includes forest and peach, cannot be the correct answer because forest can't be used in a solid rug.
  Similarly, option C, which includes peach and turquoise, and option D, which includes peach and yellow, cannot be the correct answer because peach can't be used in a solid rug.
  This leaves us with options B and E.
  If we think about a multicolored rug that includes all six colors, then both forest and yellow can be used in a solid rug, one as a primary color and one as a secondary color. Hence, option B cannot be the correct answer.
  This means that the correct answer should be option E, which includes turquoise and yellow.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are 6 colors available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
- Exactly 5 of the 6 colors will be used to weave the rugs.
- Each color used will be used only in one rug.
- If white is used in a rug, then two other colors must be used. 
- If olive is used, peach must also be used.
- Forest and turquoise cannot be used together.
- Peach and turquoise cannot be used together.
- Peach and yellow cannot be used together.

Action: 
- We know that there are exactly two solid rugs. This means that each solid rug will be woven using only one color.
- We know that each color used will be used only in one rug. This means that we can eliminate any color that has already been used in a multicolored rug.
- If white is used in a rug, two other colors must be used. This means that white cannot be used in a solid rug.
- If olive is used, peach must also be used. This means that olive and peach cannot be used in separate solid rugs.
- Forest and turquoise cannot be used together. This means that forest and turquoise cannot be used in separate solid rugs.
- Peach and turquoise cannot be used together. This means that peach and turquoise cannot be used in separate solid rugs.
- Peach and yellow cannot be used together. This means that peach and yellow cannot be used in separate solid rugs.

Based on this information, we can eliminate the following choices:
- A: forest and peach (both of these colors cannot be used in a separate solid rug)
- B: forest and yellow (yellow is already used in a multicolored rug)
- C: peach and turquoise (peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a separate solid rug)
- D: peach and yellow (peach and yellow cannot be used together in a separate solid rug)

This leaves us with only one choice that is not eliminated:
Action: Answer("E") - turquoise and yellow. Therefore, if there are exactly two solid rugs, the colors of those two rugs CANNOT be turquoise and yellow.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  We are dealing with colored thread and three rugs will be woven.
  Six colors of thread are available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  There are solid and multicolored rugs.
  If white is used, two other colors are also used.
  If olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, each solid rug will have only one color and that color will not be used in the multicolored rug. The following pairs of colors cannot both be used in the solid rugs:
  A: forest and peach.
  B: forest and yellow.
  C: peach and turquoise.
  D: peach and yellow.
  E: turquoise and yellow.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are 6 colors available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Three rugs will be woven.
  Exactly five of the colors will be used (each color will be used in only one rug).
  A rug can either be solid or multicolored.
  The rules:
    - If white is used in a rug, two other colors are also used.
    - If olive is used in a rug, peach is also used.
    - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
    - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
    - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
  We need to determine which two colors cannot be used in the two solid rugs.
  
Solution:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, the third rug must be multicolored. If white is used in the multicolored rug, two other colors must be used as well. Since there are 5 colors used in total, there must be exactly one pair of colors that doesn't appear in any of the three rugs.
  We will go through each answer choice to see if there is a pair of colors that cannot appear in any of the three rugs if exactly two of them are solid.

    A: If forest and peach are both solid, the third rug must be multicolored and cannot contain white (since white requires two other colors). There are 4 colors left: olive, turquoise, white, and yellow. If white is not used in the third rug, then olive and turquoise must both be used. However, this is not possible since forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, white must be used in the third rug, which means olive and turquoise cannot be used together. This is consistent with the rules, so option A is possible and is not the answer. 

    B: If forest and yellow are both solid, the third rug must be multicolored and cannot contain white (since white requires two other colors). There are 4 colors left: olive, peach, turquoise, and white. If white is not used in the third rug, then olive and peach must both be used. However, this is not possible since olive requires peach. Therefore, white must be used in the third rug, which means olive and turquoise cannot be used together. This is consistent with the rules, so option B is possible and is not the answer. 

    C: If peach and turquoise are both solid, the third rug must be multicolored and cannot contain white (since white requires two other colors). There are 4 colors left: forest, olive, white, and yellow. If white is not used in the third rug, then forest and olive must both be used. However, this is not possible since forest and turquoise cannot be used together. Therefore, white must be used in the third rug, which means olive and forest cannot be used together. This is consistent with the rules, so option C is possible and is not the answer.

    D: If peach and yellow are both solid, the third rug must be multicolored and cannot contain white (since white requires two other colors). There are 4 colors left: forest, olive, turquoise, and white. Since peach cannot be used with turquoise, the only possibility is that forest and olive are used in the third rug. This is consistent with the rules, so option D is possible and is not the answer.

    E: If turquoise and yellow are both solid, the third rug must be multicolored and cannot contain white (since white requires two other colors). There are 4 colors left: forest, olive, peach, and white. Since peach cannot be used with turquoise, the only possibility is that forest and olive are used in the third rug. This is consistent with the rules, so option E is possible and is not the answer.

  Therefore, the answer is **A: forest and peach**.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  We are looking for a pair of colors that cannot be used together in a solid rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then only four colors can be used in total.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. Thus, white cannot be used by itself in a solid rug.
  Olive and forest cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
Choices:
  A: forest and peach - These two colors can be used together in a single-color rug, or can be used with white in a multicolored rug. Therefore, they can be the colors of the two solid rugs. Eliminate A.
  B: forest and yellow - These two colors can be used together in a single-color rug, or can be used with white in a multicolored rug. Therefore, they can be the colors of the two solid rugs. Eliminate B.
  C: peach and turquoise - These two colors can be used together in a multicolored rug with white, or in two separate single-color rugs. Therefore, they can be the colors of the two solid rugs. Eliminate C.
  D: peach and yellow - Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be the colors of the two solid rugs. Keep D.
  E: turquoise and yellow - Turquoise and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be the colors of the two solid rugs. Keep E.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. 
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. 
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Process of elimination:
  If forest is used in a solid rug, then neither olive nor peach can be used in the same rug, so forest cannot be part of a solid rug.
  If yellow is used in any rug, then peach cannot be used in the same rug, so yellow cannot be part of a solid rug.
  If turquoise is used in a solid rug, then neither forest nor peach can be used in the same rug, so turquoise cannot be part of a solid rug.
  If a solid rug uses peach or forest, then the remaining two colors must be used. So, we need to check if any of the remaining colors violates the given conditions.
  If we choose forest and peach for the solid rugs, then the third multicolored rug may contain white, olive, turquoise, and yellow; all of these colors satisfy the given conditions. So, this choice can be part of the solid rug.
  If we choose forest and yellow for the solid rugs, then the third multicolored rug may contain white, olive, peach, or turquoise; all of these colors satisfy the given conditions. So, this choice can be part of the solid rug.
  If we choose peach and turquoise for the solid rugs, then the third multicolored rug may contain white, olive, forest, or yellow; all of these colors satisfy the given conditions. So, this choice can be part of the solid rug.
  If we choose peach and yellow for the solid rugs, then the third multicolored rug may contain white, olive, forest, or turquoise; all of these colors satisfy the given conditions. So, this choice can be part of the solid rug.
  If we choose turquoise and yellow for the solid rugs, then the third multicolored rug may contain white, olive, forest, or peach; all of these colors satisfy the given conditions. So, this choice can be part of the solid rug.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We are looking for two colors that CANNOT be used together in the two rugs.
  The rules for selecting colors for the rugs are:
  - Five of the six colors will be used.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
 
  A: The colors forest and peach could be used together.
  B: The colors forest and yellow could be used together.
  C: The colors peach and turquoise could be used together, but the prompt asks for two solid rugs, so this combination is not possible.
  D: The colors peach and yellow could not be used together, so this could be a correct answer.
  E: The colors turquoise and yellow could be used together.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored. 

A solid rug can contain only one color which means a solid rug cannot contain white or olive because the rules state "In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used" and "In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used". 

Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug. 

A solid rug can only be one color and each color can only be used in one rug. 

A: forest and peach cannot be two solid rugs because olive is not used with forest. 
B: forest and yellow can be two solid rugs.
C: peach and turquoise cannot be two solid rugs because turquoise is not used with forest in the same rug, and forest cannot be used in a solid rug.
D: peach and yellow can be two solid rugs.
E: turquoise and yellow can be two solid rugs.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  We need to select 5 colors from 6 available colors (Forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, yellow) to weave 3 rugs.
  Each color can be used in only one rug.
  The rugs can be solid or multicolored.
  If white is used in a rug, two more colors are used in that rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, peach must also be used in that rug.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Approach:
  We can solve this question by elimination.
  We can start by making a list of all color pairs that violate the given rules.
  Then we should check which pairs of colors are used in a solid rug.
  We can then compare the solid rug color pairs with the pairs we have eliminated, and the remaining pair is our answer.
 
Pairs that violate the rules:
- Forest and Turquoise
- Peach and Turquoise
- Peach and Yellow
- Olive and Forest (because Forest cannot be used in a rug with Turquoise)

Solid Rug color pairs:
- Two solid rugs mean that 2 colors will be used in solid rugs.
- So we need to check if any of these pairs are used in solid rugs:
    (Forest, Peach), (Forest, Yellow), (Peach, Turquoise), (Peach, Yellow), (Turquoise, Yellow)

Eliminated pairs not used in solid rugs: 
- (Forest, Peach) violated because they cannot be used in a rug together.
- (Forest, Yellow) does not violate any rule and can be used in a solid rug.
- (Peach, Turquoise) violated because they cannot be used in a rug together.
- (Peach, Yellow) violated because they cannot be used in a rug together.
- (Turquoise, Yellow) does not violate any rule and can be used in a solid rug.

Action: Answer("A") 
  Therefore, the colors forest and peach cannot be used in the solid rug together.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
- Two rugs are solid.
- Each color is used in only one rug.
- If white is used, two other colors are used.
- If olive is used, peach is also used.
- Forest and turquoise are not used together.
- Peach and turquoise are not used together.
- Peach and yellow are not used together.
- Six colors of thread are available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.

Based on the rules given, if there are exactly two solid rugs, then the colors of those two rugs cannot be:
- If forest is in a solid rug, there must be another forest in one of the multicolored rugs since each color is used only once. Thus, forest cannot be in a solid rug.
- If peach is in a solid rug, then olive must be in the same rug. But olive cannot be in a solid rug (since it is not mentioned in the given options). Thus, peach cannot be in a solid rug.
- If turquoise is in a solid rug, then peach cannot be in the same rug, but peach must be in the same rug as olive. But olive cannot be in a solid rug (since it is not mentioned in the given options). Thus, turquoise cannot be in a solid rug.
- Similarly, if yellow is in a solid rug, then peach cannot be in the same rug, but peach must be in the same rug as olive. But olive cannot be in a solid rug (since it is not mentioned in the given options). Thus, yellow cannot be in a solid rug.
- Therefore, the answer is A: forest and peach.

  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Analysis:
  We need to find the conditions that allow Verma to be the project leader. We can start with the third constraint. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, so Verma cannot be the project leader. It means Wells is not one of the project members.
  Next, we can look at the first constraint. Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Ruiz is not a project member, it means Quinn must be the project leader. If Quinn is not a project member, it means Ruiz must be the project leader. In either case, Verma cannot be the project leader. 
  Therefore, we know that Ruiz must be one of the project members if Verma wants to be a project leader. If Ruiz is a project member, it means Quinn must be the project leader. 
  Finally, we need to satisfy the second constraint. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have three members and one of them will be the project leader. 
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be project members if they are the project leader. 
  Smith and Taylor are mutually inclusive, meaning they can only be project members or not together.
  Wells and Verma are mutually exclusive, meaning they can never be project members together.
  
Analysis: 
  If Verma is selected as a project leader, there must be two other members who are not Wells and Ruiz. Because Wells and Verma can never both be members, Wells can't be a member; Ruiz can only be a member if selected as the project leader. This means our three members must come from the group {Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Xue}. If either Smith or Taylor is selected as a member, the other must be selected as well. This leaves two cases to evaluate: {Quinn, Smith, Taylor} and {Smith, Xue, Taylor}. To be eligible for the project leader position, Verma cannot be in either of these groups.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly three workers will be selected as project members, and one of them will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  - If Verma is the project leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a member. Otherwise, Verma cannot be a project leader.
  - From the constraints,
    - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
    - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  - From the above, if Verma is a project leader, then Smith cannot be a project member. Otherwise, Taylor must also be a project member. 
  - Also, from the above, if Verma is a project leader, then either Wells or Taylor must be a project member. Otherwise, neither of them can be in the project.
    - If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Thus, Quinn must be a project member in this case.
    - If Taylor is a project member, then Smith must also be a project member. Thus, Wells cannot be a project member in this case.
    - From the above, we can conclude that if Verma is the project leader, then Wells cannot be a project member.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Exactly 3 workers will be selected, and one of them will be the leader.
- Quinn or Ruiz must lead the project if they are selected as project members.
- If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be a project member.
- If Wells is a project member, Ruiz and Verma cannot be project members.

Analysis:
- If Verma is the leader, Ruiz cannot be a member, but if Ruiz is a member, he must be the leader. Therefore, Verma and Ruiz cannot be in the same project.
- If Smith is a member, Taylor must also be a member. If Verma is the leader and Smith and Taylor are members, then there must be one more member from the group of Quinn, Wells, and Xue.
- If either Quinn or Smith are selected, then they must be the leader, so Verma cannot be the leader.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three workers will be selected for the special project, and exactly one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be selected as project members because they can only be members if they lead the project. If Wells is selected as a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Therefore, the third project member must come from the set {Smith, Taylor, Xue}. If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected. If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected as project members because Wells must be a member if Ruiz and Verma are not. Hence, if Verma is project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected as project members. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Analysis:
  We know that only one of the three selected members can be the project leader.
  According to the first constraint, if Quinn or Ruiz is a member, then he/she must also be the project leader.
  The fourth constraint indicates that if Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Let's evaluate each choice based on these constraints:
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then there is no way for Quinn to become the project leader and select Verma as well. Incorrect.
  B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then this means that either Smith or Wells must be selected, but neither of them can have Verma as a team member due to the fourth constraint. Incorrect.
  C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then this means that either Wells or Ruiz must be selected. However, if Ruiz is selected, she must also become the project leader, which violates the constraint that Verma should be the project leader. Incorrect.
  D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then either Taylor or Wells must be selected. If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected as a team member. Hence, Taylor must be selected, and Verma can also be selected as the third member and be the project leader, satisfying all constraints. Correct.
  E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then either Smith or Ruiz must be selected, and they must be the project leader, which violates the constraint that Verma should be the project leader. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three workers will be selected as project members, and only one of them will be the leader.
  - If Quinn or Ruiz is selected to be a project member, that person must be the leader.
  - If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, then Ruiz and Verma cannot be selected.

Analysis:
  - If Verma is the leader, that means Verma will be one of the three project members selected.
  - If Wells is selected, Ruiz and Verma cannot be selected. That means, both Quinn and Smith must be selected.
  - If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, that person must be a leader. But, if Smith is one of the three project members, then Taylor must also be a project member. So, if Quinn or Ruiz is chosen, then Taylor must also be chosen.
  - If Taylor is chosen, then Smith must be chosen.
  - Therefore, the only possibility for Verma to be the leader is if:
    * Wells, Quinn and Smith are chosen,
    * Wells, Ruiz, and Taylor are chosen,
    * Wells, Quinn, and Taylor are chosen.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Only three workers will be selected to be project members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Elimination:
  - Verma can only be the project leader if none of the constraints are violated.
  - Choice A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the constraint that Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project is violated.
  - Choice B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then the constraint that Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project is violated.
  - Choice C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be, is violated.
  - Choice D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, there is no violation of the constraints.
  - Choice E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, there is no violation of the constraints.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The project leader is one of the project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected.
  
Elimination:
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor must not be a project member by the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be." This means that only two project members would be selected, which violates the requirement of exactly three workers being selected. So A is not correct.
  B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then at most two project members could be selected. This is insufficient because exactly three workers are required to be selected. So B is not correct.
  C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Smith can not be a project member, so Verma and Wells may or may not be selected, and neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be project member, so Verma can be the only remaining worker available to be the project leader. So C is correct.
  D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then at most two project members could be selected, which is not sufficient. So D is not correct.
  E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then if Smith is selected, Taylor can not be a project member, which violates the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be". Therefore E is not correct.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The project will have three members and one leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be members if they are leaders.
  If Smith is a member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a member, Ruiz and Verma cannot be.
  
Analysis:
  Since Verma could be the project leader, we need to find the set of workers who can be the project members. For each option, we can eliminate the workers who cannot be project members, and then proceed according to the constraints. 
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, the remaining candidates are: Ruiz, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue. Since Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is, and none of the workers are leaders, Verma cannot be the leader.
  B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, the remaining candidates are: Quinn, Smith, Verma, Wells, and Xue. Since Wells and Ruiz cannot be project members at the same time, and none of the workers are leaders, Verma cannot be the leader.
  C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, the remaining candidates are: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue. Since neither Smith nor Taylor can be members, none of the workers can be the leader. 
  D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, the remaining candidates are: Quinn, Ruiz, Taylor, Verma, and Wells. Since Ruiz cannot be a member if he is not a leader, and none of the workers are leaders, Verma cannot be the leader.
  E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, the remaining candidates are: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Verma, and Xue. Since Wells and Ruiz cannot be project members at the same time, and none of the workers are leaders, Verma cannot be the leader.

The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown in the afternoon.
  C: L is shown in the evening.
  D: M is shown in the morning.
  E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show 7 houses during a single day.
  The first and second houses will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J can be the sixth or seventh house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K can be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house to be shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L can be the fourth or fifth house to be shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown either in the afternoon or evening and since L can only be shown at a time after K is shown, L must be shown in the afternoon. M must be shown at some time after L is shown, so it must be shown in the afternoon as well. 
  Based on the given rules, none of the houses can be shown in the morning.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show 7 houses to a prospective buyer.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  Based on the rules, we know that J must be shown in the evening, and K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K must either be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  Also, L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon, and M must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
  Therefore, the answer is E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses: J, K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  The first and second houses are shown in the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth houses are shown in the afternoon, and the sixth and seventh houses are shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening, so it cannot be one of the first five houses.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L is shown after K and before M, so it cannot be one of the first three or last two houses.
  Therefore, K and L must be shown in the afternoon, and M must be shown in the evening.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
- The realtor will show seven houses (J, K, L, M, N, O, and P) to a prospective buyer during a single day.
- The first and second houses will be shown in the morning, so neither J nor K will be the first house shown.
- The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon, which means L must be shown in the afternoon because it is shown after K and before M.
- J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning.
- The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening, which means M must be shown in the evening because it is after L.
  
Analysis:
- K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
- L is shown in the afternoon, so it cannot be shown in the evening, and this eliminates (C).
- M must be shown in the evening because it is after L, and this eliminates (D) and (E).
- The only possible time for K is in the afternoon, so (A) cannot be true.
- Therefore, the answer is (B): L is shown in the afternoon.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day: J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon, and the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and before M is shown.

Analysis: 
  We can eliminate choices D and E because M cannot be shown in the morning (D) or in the afternoon (E) since it must be shown in the evening. 
  We can eliminate choice A because J must be shown in the evening, not K.
  We can eliminate choice B because we know that K cannot be shown in the morning, which is when the first two houses are shown, so L cannot be shown in the afternoon.
  This leaves us with choice C as the only possible answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses in a single day, with a particular order:
    - The first and second houses in the morning.
    - The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
    - The sixth and seventh houses in the evening.
  J will be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  According to the rules, we know that J will be shown in the evening. Therefore, K and L must be shown in the morning or the afternoon, and M, N, O, and P must be shown in the afternoon or evening. Also, we know that K cannot be shown in the morning. Since L must be shown after K and before M, we can infer that L must be shown in the afternoon. For the remaining choices, it is not possible to determine when M will be shown.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses labeled as J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Elimination Method:
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning but it must be shown before L. So, K cannot be shown in the evening.
  B: L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, but it could also be in the morning or evening.
  C: J must be shown in the evening and L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L is always shown in the evening.
  D: M must be shown after L, which means M cannot be shown in the morning.
  E: M must be shown after L, so M must be shown in the afternoon.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses in a single day, following a specific order regarding the morning, afternoon, and evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  J is shown in the evening, so J is the last house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or the evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. This means that L cannot be shown in the morning, because K is not shown in the morning. Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon or the evening.
  Since J is the last house to be shown, and K and L cannot be shown in the morning, the sequence of the morning houses must include M, N, O, or P.
  M must be shown after K and before L. This means that M cannot be shown in the morning or in the evening. Therefore, M must be shown in the afternoon along with N and O or P.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Using the given information, we can deduce that K cannot be shown in the morning, and that J must be shown in the evening. Also, L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, which means L has to be shown in the afternoon or evening.

Analysis:
  A: K is shown in the evening. - This is not possible as per the given information.
  B: L is shown in the afternoon. - Possible, as L can be shown in the afternoon.
  C: L is shown in the evening. - Possible, as L can be shown in the evening.
  D: M is shown in the morning. - This is not possible as the sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  E: M is shown in the afternoon. - Possible, as M can be shown in the afternoon.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. J must be shown in the evening.
  2. K cannot be shown in the morning.
  3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  4. Houses are shown in the following order: morning (1st and 2nd), afternoon (3rd, 4th, and 5th), evening (6th and 7th).
Analysis:
  From rule 1, we know that J is shown in the evening. 
  From rule 2, we know that K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. 
  From rule 3, we know that L must be shown at some time after K and before M. 
  L cannot be shown before K because K cannot be shown in the morning (rule 2). 
  Therefore, the order of showing houses in the afternoon must be K, L, and M. 
  From the given order, we know that M must be shown in the afternoon.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to any country, then Kayne must be assigned to one of the remaining countries.

Analysis:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship and Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen because Kayne is already assigned there. So, Jaramillo is only left with Venezuela. Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela (Choice A).
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned an ambassadorship, then Kayne must be assigned an ambassadorship as well.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships. Therefore, neither Novetzke nor Jaramillo can be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. Thus, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Jaramillo is not assigned as ambassador to any country. So, Jaramillo is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. Therefore, Jaramillo must not be assigned to an ambassadorship. Answer D is correct.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke is not assigned as ambassador to any country.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to any country, Kayne is also assigned as ambassador to one of the countries.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned as ambassador, it is to Zambia.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, it means Novetzke is not assigned as an ambassador to any of the three countries. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to any of the three countries, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to one of the remaining two countries.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Action: Answer("D") 
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, and Novetzke is not assigned as an ambassador to any of the three countries, then Jaramillo is not able to be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela or Zambia because Kayne must be assigned as an ambassador to one of the remaining two countries if Jaramillo is assigned as an ambassador to any of the three countries. Thus, Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, which means option D is correct.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned as ambassador to any of the countries.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must be assigned to an ambassadorship as well.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it has to be the ambassadorship to Zambia.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the countries. If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship. Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This leaves only Landon to be assigned as ambassador to Zambia, so B is the correct answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.

Analysis:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then according to the rules, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship. Therefore, Novetzke will not be assigned to Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is not assigned to Venezuela or Zambia, then Kayne will not be assigned to any ambassadorship, which is contradictory to the rule. Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. According to the rules, Landon is assigned to Zambia. Ong is not necessarily assigned to an ambassadorship in this case.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke must not be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne must not be assigned to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia.
  
Analysis:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must be assigned to one of the ambassadorship. But, Kayne is already assigned to Yemen in this case, which contradicts the constraint that Kayne must not be assigned to Yemen.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne must not be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. But, Kayne is already assigned to Yemen in this case, which contradicts the this constraint.
  Landon can not be assigned as ambassador to Zambia, because then, all the ambassadorships will be assigned but Jaramillo will not have any ambassadorship assigned to him/her. We can conclude that Jaramillo must be assigned one of the remaining two ambassadorships (Venezuela or Zambia). Then, Kayne will also be assigned one of the remaining two ambassadorships. Since Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, he cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. Hence, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Therefore Landon cannot be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Kayne or Novetzke will be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, not both.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to one.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  - Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
  None of the constraints provide information about which person will be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
  A: We cannot infer whether Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela or not, based on the given information. Jaramillo may or may not be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: We cannot infer whether Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia or not, based on the given information. Landon may or may not be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: We cannot infer whether Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia or not, based on the given information. Ong may or may not be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: If Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then the constraint "Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships" implies that Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia. However, we already know that Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, so this scenario is not possible.
  E: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then the constraint "If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen" implies that either Jaramillo or Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. However, we already know that Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, so this scenario is not possible.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship. 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Action: Answer("D")  
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship and Jaramillo has to be assigned to another ambassadorship because Kayne and Jaramillo are assigned to ambassadorships together. However, there is no constraint on whether Landon or Ong will be assigned as ambassador to any country. As such, we cannot say anything about whether Jaramillo, Landon or Ong will be assigned as ambassadors to any of the three countries. Thus, the only option that MUST be true is that Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Knowledge: Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player, and the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist. The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
 
To find who cannot perform the third solo, we should try to see which performers could perform the third solo based on the given restrictions and eliminate them. 

The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist could perform the third solo.

The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist. Since there are 6 members in the band and each person will perform one solo, we know that the keyboard player cannot perform the first or the last solo. Therefore, the keyboard player could perform the third solo.

The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, so the percussionist cannot perform the third solo.

The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, but we don't know yet if the guitarist can perform the third solo.

Finally, the violinist has to perform before the keyboard player, so the violinist cannot perform the third solo.

Based on the above, we know that the saxophonist and the keyboard player could perform the third solo, the percussionist and the violinist cannot perform the 3rd solo. We don't know yet if the guitarist can perform the third solo.

Action: Answer("A") based on the given restrictions, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the guitarist performs the third solo and therefore the guitarist is the correct answer for this question.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 6 members in the band, each of them performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  2. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  3. The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player.
  4. The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  5. The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter performs, but not both.
  
We need to determine which member cannot perform the third solo. We know from the given information that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitarist must perform either the first, second or third solo. We also know that the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the percussionist cannot perform the last solo. We know that the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter performs, but not both. This means that if the percussionist performs the second solo, the saxophonist must perform the third solo and if the trumpeter performs the second solo, the saxophonist must perform the fourth solo. 

Option B: The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist. This means that the violinist must perform before the keyboard player, and the guitarist must perform after the keyboard player. Therefore, the keyboard player cannot perform the first solo.

Option E: The violinist must perform before the keyboard player and the saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter performs. Therefore, the violinist can perform either the first or the second solo. 

Option D: The saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter performs. If the percussionist performed the second solo, then the saxophonist must perform the third solo and the trumpeter must perform the fourth solo. If the trumpeter performed the second solo, then the saxophonist must perform the fourth solo and the percussionist must perform the third solo. Therefore, the trumpeter can perform the second or the fourth solo. 

Option A: The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitarist can perform either the first, second or the third solo. 

Option C: The saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter performs. If the percussionist performed the second solo, then the saxophonist must perform the third solo. If the trumpeter performed the second solo, then the saxophonist must perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the second solo.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each member of the band performs exactly one solo.
  2. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  3. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  4. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  5. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Let's start with the third solo. The saxophonist can perform this solo if he performs after the percussionist and before the guitarist and the violinist. Let's check the options one by one.
  A: The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo. So he has to perform either the first, second, or third solo. If he performs the first or the second solo, we can see that the saxophonist can perform the third solo as well. If the guitarist performs the third solo, then the saxophonist can perform the fifth or the sixth solo. Therefore, the guitarist could perform the third solo.
  B: The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player could perform the third solo after both the violinist and the saxophonist have already performed their solos. Therefore, the keyboard player could perform the third solo.
  C: We just saw that the saxophonist can perform the third solo.
  D: The saxophonist could perform before the trumpeter or after the trumpeter. Therefore, the trumpeter could perform the third solo.
  E: The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does. Therefore, the violinist cannot perform the third solo.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: 
The third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist because he will perform solo after the keyboard player. Therefore, it is impossible that the guitarist performs a solo before the keyboard player. Hence, Answer("A").
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
  We know that each band member will perform one solo. 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, which means that the guitarist performs either the first, second, or third solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.

Analysis:
  If the guitarist performs the first solo, the saxophonist must perform the sixth solo. This conflicts with the fact that the saxophonist can't perform after both the percussionist and the trumpeter.
  If the guitarist performs the second solo, the saxophonist must perform the sixth solo. This conflicts with the fact that the saxophonist can't perform after both the percussionist and the trumpeter.
  If the guitarist performs the third solo, the keyboard player must perform the second solo, and the percussionist must perform the first solo. The saxophonist can then perform the fourth solo, and either the trumpeter or violinist can perform the fifth solo. 
  If the guitarist performs the fourth solo, this violates the condition that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  If the guitarist performs the fifth or sixth solo, the saxophonist can't perform after both the percussionist and the trumpeter.

Conclusion:
  Based on the given restrictions, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the guitarist.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  There are six members in the band: guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, and violinist.
  Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The restrictions are:
    - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
    - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
    - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: 
  We need to find out which member cannot perform the third solo. Let's see which members can perform the third solo:
  - The guitarist cannot perform the third solo because the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, meaning the guitarist can only perform the first, second, or third solo.
  - The percussionist can perform the third solo because the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. Thus, the percussionist can perform the first, second, or third solo.
  - The keyboard player can perform the third solo because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Thus, the keyboard player can perform the first, second, or third solo.
  - The saxophonist can perform the third solo because the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Thus, the saxophonist can perform the first, second, or third solo.
  - The violinist can perform the third solo because the keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does. Thus, the violinist can perform the first, second, or third solo.
  Therefore, all members are able to perform the third solo. None of the above applies.
  Answer: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Each of the six musicians performs one solo during the concert.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does.
  
Analysis:
  To perform a solo, the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist does or after the trumpeter does but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform at least third or fourth (after percussionist) or fifth or sixth (after trumpeter).
  If the violinist performs first, then the keyboard player must perform second since the keyboard player must perform after the violinist. If the guitarist performs third, then the percussionist must perform second since the percussionist performs before the keyboard player does.
  If the keyboard player performs third, then the saxophonist must perform fourth or sixth. If the saxophonist performs fourth, then the order would be Percussionist, Keyboard Player, Violinist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, Trumpeter. But this would violate the condition that saxophonist performs after either percussionist or trumpeter. If the saxophonist performs sixth, then the order would be Percussionist, Keyboard player, Violinist, Guitarist, Trumpeter, Saxophonist. This satisfies all of the conditions.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The six-member band consists of a guitarist, a keyboard player, a percussionist, a saxophonist, a trumpeter, and a violinist.
- Each member performs exactly one solo.
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
- The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
- The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does but before the guitarist does.
- The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are six members in the band and each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

To find the answer we must create a sequence of solos following the restrictions mentioned in the context. For example, by following the restrictions, we know that the guitar player must perform the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 6th solo.

Sequence
1. Percussionist
2. Guitarist
3. X
4. Violinist
5. Keyboard Player
6. Saxophonist

If the saxophonist plays solo after the percussionist, then it can't be the third solo since the percussionist has already performed his solo at that point. Therefore, the only member who could not perform the third solo is the saxophonist.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo,
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  Each member performs exactly one solo.
  
To find the answer, we need to consider who can perform at the third position. Since the guitarist doesn't perform the fourth solo, the guitarist performs in the first three solos. Also, the percussionist is early in the program, the keyboard player is not in the last three solos, and the saxophonist performs after the percussionist or the trumpeter. Therefore, the only option left for the third solo is the violinst.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the sixth audition?
Choices:
  A: Kammer's audition
  B: Lugo's audition
  C: Trillo's audition
  D: Waite's audition
  E: Zinn's audition
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded. 
  2. The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  3. The fifth audition must be recorded.
  4. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  5. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  6. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analysis:
  - To satisfy condition 3: The fifth audition must be recorded. This means that Lugo's audition must be the fifth.
  - To satisfy condition 2: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. This means that Kammer's audition must be the third.
  - To satisfy condition 4: Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. This means that Waite's audition must be either first or second.
  - To satisfy condition 5: Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. This means that Trillo's audition cannot be the third audition. It must be the fourth or later.
  - To satisfy condition 6: Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. This means that Yoshida's audition must be the last.

Action: Answer("C")    
  Trillo's audition can be the sixth one, as it can take place after Zinn's audition and before Yoshida's audition.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
- From the conditions, we know that the first three auditions are not recorded.
- We also know that the fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. So, if Waite's audition is the third one, then we can deduce that Lugo's and Kammer's auditions are the recorded ones.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. So, Kammer's audition must be either the first or the second one.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. So, Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, or the third one.

Action: Answer("C") 
Based on the given conditions, Trillo's audition could be the sixth audition.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The auditions will be held on a single day in a particular order.
  Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
  "Sixth audition" refers to the last audition.

Analysis:
  1st: Waite
  2nd: Kammer
  3rd: Trillo
  4th: cannot be recorded
  5th: Lugo
  6th: Zinn or Yoshida
  
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  Therefore, Yoshida's audition cannot be the sixth audition because Zinn's audition must be prior to Yoshida.
  
  The only possible remaining option is Answer("E") Zinn's audition.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Kammer's and Lugo's auditions will be recorded, and they must be the first two singers to audition.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fourth and fifth auditions must be Trillo's and either Waite's or Yoshida's, but we do not know which is which. 
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition cannot be the fifth. Therefore, the fifth audition must be Yoshida's, and the fourth audition must be Trillo's. 
  Kammer must audition before Trillo. Therefore Kammer must be third to audition and Trillo must be fourth.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore Zinn must be sixth.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded. The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

First, we can determine that the order of the auditions must be: Waite, X, Y, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, where X and Y are the two non-recorded auditions that we need to determine. We also know that the fifth audition must be recorded and the fourth cannot be recorded. 
 
Option A: Kammer's audition must happen earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, Kammer's audition must be fourth at the latest and cannot be the sixth audition. 
Option B: Lugo's audition must be seventh if Kammer's audition is fourth (at the earliest). Therefore, Lugo's audition cannot be the sixth audition. 
Option C: Trillo's audition must be after Kammer's audition. Therefore, Trillo's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
Option D: Waite's audition must occur earlier than the two recorded auditions (fourth and fifth auditions). Therefore, Waite's audition cannot be the sixth audition. 
Option E: Zinn's audition must happen before Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Zinn's audition cannot be the sixth audition.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  Since the first two auditions are Kammer's and Lugo's and both have to be recorded, we know that the other recorded audition must be the fifth audition.
  According to the conditions, Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, and since we already know that the fifth audition must be recorded, then Waite's audition must be the third audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition and since we know that Kammer's audition is the first audition, then Trillo's audition must be the fourth audition.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so we know that it is not possible for Trillo's audition to be the sixth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, and since Zinn's audition is not the last one, then Yoshida's audition must be the last one.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
  Therefore, Trillo's audition could be the sixth audition.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Six auditions are planned: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded and the other four will not be.
  - The order of auditions: Waite, (not recorded), Kammer (recorded), Trillo, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded and the fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Kammer's audition must occur before Trillo's audition, and Zinn's audition must occur before Yoshida's audition.

Analyzing the order of auditions and the given conditions, we can determine that Waite will be first, and Kammer's audition has to be second. The fourth audition cannot be recorded, which means that any of the remaining auditions can take place, but since the fifth audition must be recorded, Trillo cannot be the fifth audition. Also, Zinn's audition must take place before Yoshida, so Zinn must appear before Yoshida. 

Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, the only option that could be the sixth audition would be Trillo's audition.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The auditions will take place on a single day.
  - There are six singers, and each will audition once.
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analysis:
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so the fourth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded, so the fifth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be the third audition.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or the second audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, third, or fourth audition.
  - Therefore, the only option left for the sixth audition is Trillo's audition.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The six auditions are to take place in a specific order.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  The fourth audition must not be recorded, which means that the fifth and sixth auditions are the recorded ones.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, and since the fifth one is recorded, Waite's audition must be the fourth.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or the second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Yoshida's must be the last audition.
  Since there are only two auditions that could be recorded, Lugo's audition cannot be the sixth, which leaves us with three potential candidates: Kammer, Trillo, and Zinn.

Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, Trillo's audition could be the sixth audition.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded. 
  The fifth audition must be recorded. 
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. 
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. 
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
  The order of the auditions: 
  1. Waite
  2. Kammer 
  3. Trillo
  4. Zinn
  5. Lugo
  6. Yoshida
  
  A: Kammer's audition is already assigned to be the second audition, so it cannot be the sixth audition. 
  B: Lugo's audition is already assigned to be the fifth audition, so it cannot be the sixth audition.
  C: Trillo's audition is already assigned to be the third audition, so it cannot be the sixth audition.
  D: Waite's audition is already assigned to be the first audition, so it cannot be the sixth audition.
  E: Zinn's audition is already assigned to be the fourth audition, so it cannot be the sixth audition.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each of the three photographers has taken at least one photograph, but no more than three.
  - There are a total of six different photographs, exactly two photographs per section in Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Action: Answer("B") 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there are two possible scenarios for the Metro section: 
  1) One photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes and the other photograph is by Gagnon. This satisfies the condition that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. 
  2) Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. This does not satisfy the condition that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. 
Thus, we can conclude that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. Therefore, the answer is B.

Knowledge:
  - 6 different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section, in Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - The photographs were taken by Fuentes, Gagnon, or Hue.
  - Selection is constrained by certain conditions:
    - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three of their photographs appear.
    - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
    - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
    - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("B")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, it means that the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. However, we cannot conclude anything about the number of photographs in the Metro section taken by Gagnon or Hue. We also cannot conclude anything about the number of photographs in the Sports section taken by Hue. Since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, we cannot conclude that exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue, nor that both are by Hue. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Six different photographs must appear, exactly two photographs per section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- At least one but no more than three of each photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
- There cannot be any other photographs by Gagnon in any other section (because there can't be any Gagnon photographs in the Sports section).
- At least one photograph in Lifestyle is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. If that photograph is not the one by Gagnon, then it must be by Fuentes. 
- At least one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes or Hue.
- At least one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes or Hue.

A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. (not necessarily true, it could also be by Hue) 
B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. (not possible, since Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section)
C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. (not possible, since another photograph by Gagnon cannot appear in any other section)
D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. (not necessarily true, it could also be by Fuentes)
E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. (not necessarily true, they could also be by Fuentes) 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - A total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. 
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. 
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then we must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes. For this to happen, Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section. From the given choices, exactly one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon (since we already have one photograph in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon). Therefore, (B) Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon must be true.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- Six photographs will appear, two in each of the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of their photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in Lifestyle must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro.
- The number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle must be the same as the number of Fuentes's photographs in Sports.
- Gagnon's photographs cannot appear in Sports.

If one photograph in Lifestyle is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then we know that the remaining photograph in Lifestyle must be by either Fuentes, Gagnon, or Hue. We also know that at least one photograph in Lifestyle is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro, and since one of the photos in Lifestyle is by Gagnon or Hue, it follows that the remaining Lifestyle photo must be by Fuentes, who has not yet appeared in Metro. 

Furthermore, since Gagnon's photographs cannot appear in Sports, and we know that there is exactly one Hue photograph in Lifestyle, which must match the number of Fuentes photos in Sports, we can determine that the remaining Sports photo must be by Gagnon.

Therefore, we can conclude that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes, which is the answer to this question. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper will each have two different photographs.
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each photographer has between one and three photos appearing throughout the sections.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
    - There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section that is by Fuentes.
    - There must be at least one photograph in the Metro section that is by one of Fuentes or Gagnon.
    - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
    - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there are two remaining photographers (Fuentes and either Gagnon or Hue) who have a photo in the Lifestyle section. From the given conditions, we know that one of these two photographers must also have a photo in the Metro section. Therefore, there are two possibilities:
  1. Fuentes has a photo in both the Lifestyle and Metro sections, and the other photographer (either Gagnon or Hue) has the other Metro photo.
  2. Either Gagnon or Hue has a photo in both the Lifestyle and Metro sections, and Fuentes has the other Metro photo.
  In possibility 1, Fuentes has two photos overall, so the remaining photo in the Sports section must be by either Gagnon or Hue. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon (answer B).
  In possibility 2, either Gagnon or Hue has two photos overall, which contradicts the given conditions that no photographer can have more than three photos total. Therefore, possibility 2 is not valid. Answer B is the only possible outcome.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  There will be six different photographs in total, exactly two photographs per section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("B") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes' photographs can be in either the Metro or Sports section, but there can be at most one photograph by Fuentes in each of these sections. We do not have any information about the number of photographs taken by Gagnon that will be in the Metro section. However, because none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, we know that there cannot be any photographs taken by Hue in the Sports section. Therefore, we can conclude that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is either by Fuentes or by Gagnon. The only answer that reflects this deduction is B.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - A total of 6 different photographs are to appear, with exactly 2 photographs per section in Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Solution:
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
- There must be at least one photo in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes.
- From the last two conditions, there must be at least one photo by Fuentes in the Sports section, and at least one photo by Hue in the Lifestyle section.
- Since one photo in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon, there can't be any in the Sports section.
- Therefore, one photo in the Metro section must be by Fuentes, and one photo in the Sports section must be by Hue.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, Fuentes must have 2 photographs in the Metro section. According to the constraints, Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section, which means Fuentes cannot have more than two photographs in the Metro section, therefore one photograph in the Metro section is not taken by Fuentes. Moreover, Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, Hue must have at least one photograph and at most three photographs in the Sports section. If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, and Fuentes has two photographs in the Metro section, then it follows that:

A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. - Not necessarily true.
B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. - Not necessarily true.
C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - Not necessarily true.
D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - Not necessarily true.
E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - Not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Each section (L, M, S) consists of 2 photos and each photo is taken by 1 photographer from a pool of 3 photographers (F, G, H).
  2. F can have 1, 2 or 3 photos in S. Similarly, H can have 1, 2 or 3 photos in L.
  3. At least one photo in L is by a photographer who has at least one photo in M.
  4. The number of photos by H in L is the same as the number of photos by F in S.
  5. G cannot have any photo in S.

There are two photos in L, one of them is taken by Gagnon (G) and the other is taken by Hue (H).

Option A: There is no information about the number of photos in the Metro section taken by Fuentes (F). This option may or may not be true.
Option B: Gagnon (G) has already one photo in L, so there cannot be any photo by G in either L or S. This option is not true.
Option C: Gagnon (G) cannot have any photo in S. This option is not true.
Option D: Hue (H) has already one photo in L, so there cannot be any photo by H in S. This option is not true.
Option E: Hue (H) has already one photo in L, and the number of photos by H in L is equal to the number of photos by Fuentes (F) in S. Therefore, there must be one photo by H and one photo by F in S. This option is true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The bakery makes three kinds of cookies - oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  There are 3 batches of each kind of cookie made each week.
  Each batch is made on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies (one of each of the remaining kinds) made that day.
  
Analysis: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, and there must be two batches of cookies made that day, one of each of the remaining kinds, then there must be one batch of oatmeal and one batch of sugar cookies made on that day. This means that one batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, another must be made on Tuesday, and the final batch must be made on Friday. There are only three kinds of cookies, and three batches of each kind are made each week, so we know that there must be exactly one batch of each kind of cookie made on Tuesday and Friday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- There are 3 types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
- Exactly 3 batches of each type of cookie are made each week.
- Each batch is made on a single day.
- No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
- At least one batch is made on Monday.
- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
- We need to find what "must be true" if no batches are made on Wednesday.

Let's consider the information and apply the rules:
- The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday because another batch of oatmeal cookies is made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday as well.
- By similar reasoning, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday.
- Since there are no batches made on Wednesday, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday, and the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday.
- Therefore, on Tuesday, there are only two batches left to make: peanut butter and sugar. These batches must be made on Tuesday. So, three batches must be made on Friday.
- At least one batch is made on Monday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. So there are at least two batches made on Monday.
Action: Answer("D") - At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. A total of 3 kinds of cookie and 3 batches of each cookie (total of 9 batches) are made each week.
  2. Each batch of cookies is made on a single day.
  3. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  4. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  5. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  6. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  7. Exactly one batch of each kind of cookie is made on each day of the week.
  8. If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then 3 batches of cookies must be made on the other 4 days combined (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday).
  
Analysis:
  Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then 3 batches of cookies must be made on the other 4 days combined (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday). 
  We know that:
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. Therefore, at most two batches of cookies can be made on Tuesday, and at most two batches of cookies can be made on Friday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, exactly one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on the same day.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, exactly one batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then exactly three batches of cookies must be made on Friday to satisfy the conditions.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. There are three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. There are three batches made for each type of cookie, giving a total of nine batches per week.
  3. Each batch is made in a single day.
  4. No two batches of the same type are made on the same day.
  5. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  6. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Action: 
If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are 2 possibilities:
  1. All three batches of cookies made on Wednesday. This is not allowed.
  2. No batches of cookies made on Wednesday.
  
Since no batches of cookies can be made on Wednesday, then:
  - One batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
  - One batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday.
  - One batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday or Friday.
  - The other batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
If the sugar cookies are made on Monday, then the other batch of oatmeal cookies and peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the other batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.
  
This means that exactly three batches of cookies were made on Tuesday (one each of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar), and exactly three batches of cookies were made on Friday (two of oatmeal and one of sugar). Therefore:

Answer: B) Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - A total of 3 x 3 = 9 batches of cookies are made each week.
  - No two batches of the same cookie kind are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal and the first batch of peanut butter is made on the same day.
  - The second batch of sugar is made on Thursday.
  
Test each option:
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we have 7 batches left to distribute among the remaining days: 3 on Tuesday and 4 on Friday.
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. This is not true, since there are only 3 batches made on Tuesday and no more.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. This is not true, since there are only 2 batches made on Friday and no more.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday. This cannot be true since there is at least one batch made on Monday and no more batches of the same type can be made on the same day.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday. This is not true since there is only one batch made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday. This cannot be true since there must be at least one batch made on Monday and there are three batches made on Tuesday.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The bakery makes three kinds of cookies - oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, that means the three batches of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday or Friday.

Analysis:
  From the rules, we know that:
  - Exactly one batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, and one is made on a later day. So, at most, one batch of oatmeal cookies will be made on Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  - Exactly one batch of peanut butter cookies is made on a day after the first batch of oatmeal cookies. So, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  - Exactly one batch of sugar cookies is made on a day after the second batch of oatmeal cookies. So, the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday or Friday and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. 

Action: Answer("B")  

If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, that means the three batches of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday. But we know that exactly one batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, and at most, one batch of oatmeal cookies will be made on Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday. It means that exactly two batches of oatmeal cookies are made on Thursday and Friday. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, that means the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, and the other batches of cookies - peanut butter and the rest of the sugar cookies- must be made on Friday. Thus, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Solution:
  Let assume that there is no batch of cookies made on Wednesday. Then:
   - Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made in the same day, then at most one batch of cookie is made on Wednesday.
   - At least one batch of cookie is made on Monday, and at most one batch of cookie is made on Wednesday. Therefore, at least two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, and at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday and Friday because exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  So, exactly three batches of cookies must be made on Friday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday), and each batch is made from start to finish on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then only one batch of cookies is made on that day.
  Therefore, there can be a maximum of two batches of cookies made on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday each.
  
Analysis: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the only possibility is that one batch of cookies was made on that day. Therefore, two batches of cookies were made on Monday, and two batches of cookies must be made on another day. 
  Since the second batch of sugar cookies was made on Thursday, it is not possible to make two batches of cookies on Thursday. Therefore, two batches of cookies must be made on Friday. 
  Thus, exactly three batches of cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- The bakery makes exactly 3 kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
- Exactly 3 batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, and each batch is made on a single day.
- No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday
- At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday 
- The question is asking about the scenario where no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.

Analysis:
- If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there can be only 2 cases: 
  * The two remaining batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and Thursday, or 
  * The two remaining batches of cookies are made on Monday and Friday.
- In the first case, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
- In the second case, exactly two batches of cookies are made on Monday, and exactly two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
- We must determine which of the above cases is true based on the given information.
- Now let's evaluate each option based on the above analysis.

Action: Answer("B") 

Option A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
- This option is possible if no batches of cookies are made on Monday or Friday.
- However, we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
- Therefore, this option cannot be true.

Option B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
- This option is possible only if two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
- This means that no batches of cookies are made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
- Therefore, this option can be true in the scenario given in the question.

Option C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
- This option is possible, but it is not necessary for the scenario given in the question.
- Therefore, this option cannot be true.

Option D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
- This option is not true because we know that only one batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Option E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
- This option is not true because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and we know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookies are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the earliest the bakery can make the second batch of oatmeal cookie is on Tuesday. Additionally, the earliest the bakery can make the second batch of sugar cookies is on Wednesday if it is not made on Tuesday. Therefore, the only day left to make the third batch of sugar cookies is on Friday. Hence,

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A teacher will assign each of five students—Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga—to exactly one of two research teams, the green team and the red team. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The teams are Green and Red.
  - One team has 2 members and the other has 3 members.
  - One member of each team is a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the Green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana and Olga must be on different teams.

Action: Answer("C") 

Based on the given information, the only choice that must be true is that Olga is assigned to the Green team, as she is already designated as a facilitator and Lateefah is already on the Green team.  The assignment of the remaining students and the roles they play on their teams are not determined.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two teams: a team of two and a team of three.

Thinking process:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, we know that the team of three must be the green team. Hence, Olga and another member (Juana or Mei) are part of the green team. Thus, Olga and Juana cannot be in the same team. This leaves us with the following team assignments: green(Facilitator: Olga, Lateefah, Mei) and red(Facilitator: Juana, Kelly). This satisfies all the given conditions. 
  Therefore, we can conclude that D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. must be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The green team has Lateefah and Olga, where Olga is a facilitator. 
  Kelly is not a facilitator. 
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. 
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. 
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  
Analysis:
  Option A is possible. It doesn't violate any of the given conditions.
  Option B is not true. It is given that Olga is a facilitator.
  Option C is not necessarily true. Olga is a facilitator, but it is not specified to which team she is assigned.
  Option D is not true. Juana and Mei may be assigned to the same or different teams, but they can't be both facilitators.
  Option E is not necessarily true. Juana may or may not be a facilitator.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are 5 students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  Two teams: green and red.
  One team will have two members and the other team will have three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  Juana and Olga must be on different teams.
  Lateefah is on the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.

Analysis:
  We know Lateefah is on the green team and Olga is a facilitator, so Olga must be the facilitator on the green team.
  Thus, Lateefah must be on the same team with Olga.
  Juana and Olga cannot be on the same team, so Juana must be on the red team. 
  We don't know anything about Mei, but it doesn't matter for this question.
  Since Kelly is not a facilitator, she cannot be on the same team with Lateefah and Olga.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  2. Kelly is not a facilitator.
  3. Olga is a facilitator.
  4. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  5. Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  From condition 5, Juana and Olga cannot be on the same team. If Olga is a facilitator, there are two possible cases:
  * Olga is on the green team along with Lateefah, and Juana is on the red team.
  * Olga is on the red team, and Mei and Juana are on the green team.
  In both cases, Lateefah is not a facilitator. Therefore, Lateefah cannot be a facilitator. 

Knowledge:
  6. Lateefah is not a facilitator.
  
Analysis:
  Since Lateefah is not a facilitator, Olga is the facilitator on the green team, which means Lateefah is on the green team. Since the other team has two members, Juana and Mei must be on it.

Knowledge:
  7. Lateefah is on the green team.
  8. Olga is a facilitator, and therefore, on the green team.
  9. Juana and Mei are on the red team.

Analysis:
  The correct answer must be logically derived from the statements above. 
  A: Juana cannot be assigned to the red team because Juana and Mei are on the red team. Incorrect.
  B: Lateefah cannot be a facilitator. Incorrect.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team. Correct.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. Correct.
  E: Kelly is not a facilitator, but the answer does not provide any new information. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The teams have 2 and 3 members.
  One member of each team is a facilitator.
  Juana is not on the same team as Olga.
  Lateefah is on the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  
Reasoning:
  Since Lateefah is assigned to the green team, we know that the green team has Lateefah and one other member. Therefore, the other member in the green team must be Olga, who is a facilitator. This means that Olga and Lateefah are on the same team. Since Juana cannot be on the same team as Olga, Juana must be on the red team with Mei. Since Olga is a facilitator, there is only one facilitator slot left, which must go to the 3rd member in the red team. Therefore, Mei is not a facilitator but Juana could be a facilitator. Kelly is not a facilitator.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Two members will be assigned to the red team, and three members will be assigned to the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are only two teams: a green team with three members and a red team with two members.
  Since Olga is a facilitator, she must be on the team with two members.
  Therefore, the only possible arrangement is Olga and Mei on the red team, and Juana, Kelly, and Lateefah on the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, so Juana is on the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Kelly is on the green team.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  
Solution:
  Since only one person from each team can be a facilitator, Olga is the facilitator for her team, which must be the team that has three members since the other team has two members. Therefore, Olga is on the green team. Lateefah is also on the green team, so the other member of the green team must be Mei. Since Juana and Olga are on different teams, Juana is on the red team with Kelly. Since Kelly is not a facilitator, Juana is also not a facilitator. Therefore, D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators must be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  One team has two members, and the other team has three members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Analysis:
  Since there are only five people and one team will have two members, the other team will have three members.
  Lateefah must be assigned to the green team, and Olga must be a facilitator on the other team.
  Juana must be assigned to the red team since Juana cannot be on the same team as Olga.
  Since there are only two facilitators and Olga is one of them, Kelly cannot be a facilitator.
  The last member Mei can be a facilitator or not.

  D: This choice is not possible because only one house will be shown in the evening after J. 
  E: This choice is not possible because N, and P cannot be shown in the afternoon if K is shown in the morning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning and J must be shown in the evening. This choice cannot be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The realtor will show 7 houses during the day: J, K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  - The first two houses will be shown in the morning; the 3rd, 4th, and 5th houses will be shown in the afternoon; and the last 2 houses will be shown in the evening.
  - J must be shown in the evening.
  - K cannot be shown in the morning.
  - L must be shown after K and before M.

Analysis:
  - Choice A: If K is shown after J, then K would be shown in the afternoon, which contradicts the statement that K cannot be shown in the morning. So, A cannot be true.
  - Choice B: L must be shown after K and before M, but J must be shown in the evening, so there is no guarantee that L will be shown after J. So, B could be true, but there is not enough information to determine its truth.
  - Choice C: There is no information about when P will be shown, so C could be true, but there is not enough information to determine its truth.
  - Choice D: There is no information to support this statement, so it cannot be true.
  - Choice E: There is no information to support this statement, so it cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - J is shown in the evening.
  - K cannot be shown in the morning.
  - L must be shown after K is shown and before M is shown.
  - The afternoon houses are the third, fourth, and fifth houses shown.
  - The morning houses are the first and second houses shown.
  - The evening houses are the sixth and seventh houses shown.

A) K is shown at some time after J is shown:
  - Since J must be shown in the evening, this rule does not allow K to be shown after J.
  
B) L is shown at some time after J is shown:
  - Since J must be shown in the evening, this rule does not allow L to be shown after J.
  
C) P is shown at some time after J is shown:
  - Since J must be shown in the evening, this rule allows P to be shown at some time after J is shown.
  
D) Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown:
  - There are no restrictions on when N and O can be shown, so it is possible that they are both shown at some time after M is shown. However, this choice is asking for "could be true", not "must be true", so we cannot select this choice since we don't have enough information to determine whether this is true or not.
  
E) Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown:
  - We know that K cannot be shown in the morning, but we don't know whether it is shown in the afternoon or evening. Therefore, it is possible that N and P are both shown at some time after K is shown in the afternoon or evening, so this choice could be true.
 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show the seven houses in a specific order, with the three groups being: morning, afternoon, and evening.
  J must be shown in the evening, so it must be the sixth or the seventh.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K and before M.
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or the evening. However, J must be shown in the evening, so this option is not possible.
  B: J must be shown in the evening, so L must be shown in the afternoon, which means that L cannot be shown after J. This option is not possible.
  C: This option is possible since P can be shown at any time during the day as it is not restricted by any rules.
  D: This option is not possible since there are only two houses left to be shown after M has been shown. 
  E: This option is not possible since N and P cannot both be shown after K since K cannot be shown in the morning and N and P would need to be shown in the afternoon or the evening.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The realtor has to show seven houses - J, K, L, M, N, O, and P - during a single day.
  The first and second houses are shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses are shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses are shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and before M is shown.
  
Solution:
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning, and J must be shown in the evening, so K cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. Hence, A is false.
  B: J must be shown in the evening. If L is shown after J, then L must also be shown in the evening, but that would mean there would be three houses shown in the evening. Therefore, B is false.
  C: J must be shown in the evening, and P could be shown in the evening after J. Hence, C could be true.
  D: There are only two houses left - N and O - and they both have to be shown in the afternoon, which means one must be shown before the other. Hence, D is false.
  E: K must be shown at some time before L is shown and both N and P could be shown at some time after K is shown. Hence E is true.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show 7 houses to a prospective buyer in a single day.
  The houses will be shown in groups of 2, 3, and 2 in the morning, afternoon, and evening, respectively.
  J will be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Elimination:
  A: If K is shown at some time after J is shown, then J cannot be shown in the evening. So, this choice cannot be true.
  B: L must be shown at some time after K is shown, but J must be shown in the evening. So, this choice cannot be true.
  C: Since J is shown in the evening and P is to be shown sometime during the day, it is possible for P to be shown after J is shown. So, this choice could be true.
  D: The rule doesn't inform anything about N and O.
  E: L must be shown at some time before M is shown, but both N and P are to be shown after K is shown. So, this choice cannot be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses in a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Analyzing the choices:
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is not shown before J. Incorrect.
  B: L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. It is possible that J is shown in the morning followed by K, then L is shown; that satisfies the requirements. Correct.
  C: There is no requirement for P. Therefore, it can be shown at any time. This choice may or may not be correct. Insufficient information.
  D: This choice is not possible since there is only one house left and it can only be shown in the evening. Incorrect.
  E: N cannot be shown after K and also in the evening. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. The realtor will show the houses in the following order: 1, 2, {K}, {L}, {M}, 6, 7 where the numbers represent the order in which they are shown during the day.
  2. J must be shown in the evening
  3. K cannot be shown in the morning.
  4. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  (A) cannot be true because K cannot be shown in the morning. 
  (B) could be true because L needs to be shown at some time after K is shown. 
  (C) could be true because P is not limited in when it can be shown. 
  (D) cannot be true because the realtor will show only one house in the evening. 
  (E) cannot be true because only one house is shown between K and M.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Knowledge: Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings. 
  The possible trades are: 
  1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
  2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
  3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis: 
  Since Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, they must have traded all their class 2 buildings for either class 1 buildings or class 3 buildings. 
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are the only class 3 buildings, and the Flores Tower is the only class 1 building. 
  If Trustcorp traded one of their class 2 buildings for the Flores Tower (class 1), then Southco would own both class 1 and class 2 buildings. 
  If Trustcorp traded one of their class 2 buildings for the Yates House (class 3), then they would have two class 3 buildings, which contradicts the fact that they own only class 2 buildings. 
  Therefore, Southco must have traded at least one of their class 2 buildings for the Zimmer House (class 3), which means that RealProp owns the Yates House (class 3) and the Garza Tower (class 1).

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
- Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
- Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
- Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
  - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
  - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
  - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
- Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.

Action: 
- Since Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, we cannot use option C, which implies Southco might have traded a class 2 building with Trustcorp.
- We can only use option A or D to explain why Trustcorp no longer owns class 2 buildings, but D is not possible, because the Garza Tower (which is a class 1 building) is owned by RealProp and not Trustcorp.
- Therefore, we can conclude that option A must be true, which is 'RealProp owns a class 1 building.'

Answer: Answer('A')
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - RealProp owns Garza Tower (C1), Yates House (C3), and Zimmer House (C3)
  - Southco owns Flores Tower (C1) and Lynch Building (C2)
  - Trustcorp owns King Building (C2), Meyer Building (C2), and Ortiz Building (C2)
  - The trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
      - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
      - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
      - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  - Trustcorp owns no C2 buildings after some number of trades.

Action: Answer("E")
Explanation: 
  - If Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower (C1), then RealProp has only two buildings left and they are both C3. The only way to trade would be to trade a C1 building for two C2 buildings or to trade a C2 building for two C3 buildings. Either way, Trustcorp would end up with a C2 building, which is not possible given that Trustcorp owns no C2 buildings after some number of trades.
  - Southco owns only one C1 building and Trustcorp owns no C2 buildings. Thus, if Southco has not made any trade with Trustcorp, then Southco cannot get a second C1 building and Trustcorp cannot get a C2 building without violating the trading rules.
  - Trustcorp cannot trade a C2 building for two C3 buildings, because Trustcorp owns no C2 building to trade.
  - Therefore, the only possible option is Trustcorp trading Yates House (C3) for two C2 buildings. It follows that Trustcorp is left with only C1 and C3 buildings. Since Trustcorp owns all C2 buildings initially, Trustcorp does not own the Zimmer House (C3). Therefore, the only option left is Trustcorp owning the King Building (C2) and the Meyer Building (C2) and the Ortiz Building (C2), which means Trustcorp owns the King Building (C2). Thus, the correct answer is E.
Response 3:
Knowledge: Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings at the beginning. There are three types of trades and Trustcorp needs to trade its class 2 buildings for either class 1 or class 3 buildings.

Analysis: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings, then it must have traded all of them. Since Trustcorp started with all class 2 buildings and traded them, it must have acquired either class 1 or class 3 buildings. Option A is possible, but not necessarily true. Option B is not possible, as Southco does not own any class 3 buildings. Option C is possible, but not necessarily true. Option D is not possible, as RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is a class 1 building. Option E is possible, but not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings and each trade involves only buildings of the same class or different classes. Therefore, Trustcorp can only get rid of its class 2 buildings by trading them for class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  A: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1) but there is no information to suggest that Trustcorp will trade with RealProp to acquire a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). If Southco trades the Lynch Building for class 2 or class 3 buildings (to Trustcorp or to RealProp), Southco will still own class 2 buildings.
  C: Trustcorp can trade its class 2 buildings only for class 1 or class 3 buildings, and Southco owns no class 3 buildings. Therefore, Southco cannot trade with Trustcorp. 
  D: Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Therefore, Trustcorp cannot own the Garza Tower, which is a class 1 building owned by RealProp.
  E: Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Therefore, Trustcorp cannot own the Zimmer House, which is a class 3 building owned by RealProp. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings 
  RealProp owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building 
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following types:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings, then Trustcorp cannot trade its class 2 buildings for any class 3 buildings.
  A: There is no information in the context that tells about the ownership of class 1 buildings of RealProp.
  B: Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building. So, it is not possible that Southco only owns class 2 buildings.
  C: Cannot be determined from the given information.
  D: Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings. So, Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.
  E: RealProp owns the Zimmer House, which is a class 3 building. Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings and cannot trade a class 2 building for a class 3 building. So, Trustcorp does not own the Zimmer House. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower which is a class 1 building.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower which is a class 1 building.
  Southco owns the Lynch Building which is a class 2 building.
  RealProp owns two class 3 buildings, the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  
Solution:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings, then it must have traded both the Meyers Building and Ortiz Building, which are both class 2, for buildings of either class 1 or class 3. This means Trustcorp has traded away all its class 2 buildings. If Trustcorp didn't trade class 2 building with RealProp, then RealProp cannot own any class 2 building. Therefore, RealProp owns the Garza Tower which is class 1. Southco owns only one class 2 building which is the Lynch Building; this means it cannot own only class 2 buildings. Since Trustcorp doesn't have any class 2 building, it must have traded with Southco, and Southco has a class 2 building Lynch Building. So, the correct answer is C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, and it uses them to trade with the other real estate companies.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  
Analysis:
  If Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings, then it must have traded them with the other two companies.
  Southco owns only two buildings, one of which is class 1; therefore, it cannot provide two class 2 buildings in any trade.
  If Trustcorp made a trade with Southco, then it must have received a class 1 building or a class 3 building in exchange for a class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp received a class 1 building from Southco, then it must have traded this building with RealProp for two class 2 buildings. 
  Therefore, RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means Trustcorp must have traded away all its class 2 buildings for class 1 or class 3 buildings. 
  So they must have traded for Realprop's Yates House, which is class 3, or Realprop's Zimmer House, which is also class 3, or both. 
  In both cases, Southco still owns a class 2 building (Lynch Building). 
  So, B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings is the answer.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower), a class 3 building (Yates House), and a class 3 building (Zimmer House).
  Southco owns a class 1 building (Flores Tower) and a class 2 building (Lynch Building).
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings (King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building).
  Each trade must involve exactly one building and must be one of the three types described.
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some trades. 
  
Possible logic to answer the question:
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some trades, and it starts with three class 2 buildings, then it must have made at least one trade involving a class 2 building. Therefore, we can rule out choices A and D.
  If Southco owns only class 2 buildings, then it has traded away its class 1 building (Flores Tower) in exchange for two class 2 buildings. That would mean that Trustcorp must own a class 1 building and would contradict the fact that Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings. Therefore, we can rule out choice B.
  If Southco has not made any trade with Trustcorp, then it must have traded its class 1 building (Flores Tower) for two class 2 buildings with RealProp or with another company. That would mean that RealProp must own a class 1 building, and Trustcorp must still own at least one class 2 building. Therefore, we can rule out choice C.
  The only choice left is E. Trustcorp owning the Zimmer House would be consistent with it not owning any class 2 buildings after trades, and it would not contradict any of the other facts given in the problem.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Vegemite slot < Zircon slot
  - Wellspring slot < Xpert slot and Zircon slot < Xpert slot
  - Uneasy slot is in the range of 4-6
  - Yardsign slot is in the range of 1-3
  - Wellspring slot is immediately before Xpert slot
Constraints:
  - Yardsign in slots 1-3, so Wellspring and Zircon in slots 1-2.
  - Since Wellspring is immediately before Xpert, so Wellspring and Zircon must be in slots 1 and 2 in some order.
  - Thus, Vegemite must be in slot 3, and Uneasy must be in slot 5 or 6.
Action: 
From the above knowledge and constraints, the only valid option is that Zircon performs in slot 4. Therefore, Answer("E").
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—perform in the six slots of a benefit concert. 
  Constraints:
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, Wellspring cannot perform in slot six, nor in slot one. Yardsign has to perform in either slot one, two, or three. If Vegemite performs in slot two, then Zircon has to perform in slot four, and Xpert in slot five, which means that Uneasy has to perform in slot six, violating the constraint that Yardsign plays in one of the first three slots. Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot two. If Wellspring performs in slot one, then Yardsign has to perform in slots two or three, which is possible. Then, Vegemite can play in slot three or four, and Zircon in slot five or six, and Xpert in the remaining slot. This satisfies all the constraints and is a valid order for the bands.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The six slots at the benefit concert are numbered slot one through slot six.
  - The six bands are Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
  Analysis: Since Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, Xpert should perform at either slot five or slot six, and Wellspring should perform at either slot four or slot five.
  A: Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, slot five cannot be Uneasy's slot. Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot five.
  B: Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, and Yardsign cannot be in slot one, then Vegemite cannot be in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performing in slot three would mean that Xpert would perform in slot four, which violates the constraint that Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  D: Zircon cannot perform in slot two because Wellspring and Zircon both perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  E: If Zircon were to perform in slot four, then Xpert would perform in slot six, which violates the constraint that Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Since Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Xpert must perform in slot six and Wellspring in slot five. 
  Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, which means that Vegemite must perform in slot two. 
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it must be in either slot four, five, or six.
  Zircon must perform in one of the earlier slots than Xpert, which means it must be in either slot two, three, or four. 
  Based on these constraints, the possible order of performances is: 
  [Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Uneasy, Xpert] 
Choices: 
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five. - False, Uneasy must perform in either slot four, five, or six.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three. - False, Vegemite must perform in slot two.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three. - False, Wellspring must perform in slot five.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two. - True, Zircon can perform in slot two based on the constraints.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four. - False, Zircon must perform in slot two, three, or four but not after Wellspring. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

  - There are six slots numbered from one to six.
  - There are six bands named Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - No two bands can perform in the same slot.
  - Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the bands must be one of the following:
- [Yardsign], [Vegemite], [Zircon], [Wellspring], [Xpert], [Uneasy]
- [Vegemite], [Yardsign], [Zircon], [Wellspring], [Xpert], [Uneasy]
- [Yardsign], [Vegemite], [Zircon], [Xpert], [Wellspring], [Uneasy]
- [Vegemite], [Yardsign], [Zircon], [Xpert], [Wellspring], [Uneasy]

A: Uneasy can only perform in slot six. (Incorrect)
B: Vegemite must perform after Zircon, so it cannot perform in slot three. (Incorrect)
C: Wellspring cannot perform in slot three because Xpert performs after Wellspring. (Incorrect)
D: Zircon can only perform after Vegemite, so it cannot perform in slot two. (Incorrect)
E: Zircon can perform in slot four based on the first and second order. (Correct)

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands need to fill six slots numbered one to six.
  - Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
  
Working through the options:
  A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, it would violate the constraint that Uneasy should perform in one of the last three slots.
  B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Uneasy must perform in slot 4 or 5, which violates the constraint that Uneasy should perform in one of the last three slots.
  C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Xpert would have to perform either in slot five or six, in both cases violating the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then Vegemite would have to perform in slot one, violating the constraint that Yardsign should perform in one of the first three slots.
  E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then Wellspring occupies slot two and Xpert occupies slot five, satisfying all the constraints.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands - Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon - will fill six slots numbered one through six.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.

Approach:
  - Wellspring must perform before Xpert. Therefore, Xpert cannot perform in slot two.
  - Based on the constraint, Zircon cannot start performing from slot two.
  - Yardsign must perform in the first three slots. Hence Vegemite doesn't perform in slot six.
  - Wellspring cannot perform in slot one; Zircon cannot perform in slot two. Hence, Wellspring can only perform in slot three.
  
Action: Answer("C") - Wellspring performs in slot three.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The slots are numbered one through six, from earliest to latest.
  Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then we know that the order of the slots must be Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy.
A: Uneasy cannot perform in slot five, since Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
B: Vegemite must perform in slot two, after Yardsign.
C: Wellspring must perform in slot four.
D: Zircon must perform in slot three.
E: Zircon cannot perform in slot four, since Xpert must perform after Wellspring.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 6 slots and 6 bands.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
  A: Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, but Wellspring performs before Xpert, so Uneasy cannot perform in slot five.
  B: Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, so Vegemite cannot perform in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs before Xpert, so Wellspring cannot perform in slot three.
  D: Zircon must perform in a slot earlier than Xpert, but not in the same slot as Wellspring. So, Zircon cannot perform in slot two.
  E: Zircon must perform in a slot earlier than Xpert, and immediately after Wellspring. So, Zircon can perform in slot four.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six slots numbered from one to six and six bands named Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  
  A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, then Yardsign should perform in slot one. However, this is not possible as Vegemite must perform before Zircon, and there is no slot available for Vegemite to perform if Yardsign performs in slot one. Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot five.
  B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then the slot order would be: Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy. This order violates the constraint that Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert. Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot three.
  C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then the slot order would be: Yardsign, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy, Vegemite. This order satisfies all the constraints given in the question, making C possible.
  D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then the slot order would be: Yardsign, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy, Vegemite. This order violates the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot two.
  E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then the slot order would be: Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Uneasy. This order violates the constraint that Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot four.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Ong will be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  2. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  3. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  4. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  5. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Analysis:
  From the rules, we know that Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen because Ong is already assigned to Venezuela. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Zambia or Yemen. Also, if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned together to Zambia or Yemen. Landon is only assigned to Zambia. Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Novetzke.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Ong is assigned as the ambassador to Venezuela.
  - Landon is the ambassador to Zambia.
  - If Jaramillo is an ambassador, then Kayne is also an ambassador.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
  A: Jaramillo and Landon cannot be the other ambassadors as Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned together.
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke cannot both be the other ambassadors as only one of them can be an ambassador.
  C: Kayne cannot be an ambassador to Zambia because Landon is already assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: This option is consistent with all constraints. Kayne is not assigned to Yemen where Ong is already assigned. Jaramillo and Novetzke are assigned to the remaining two countries.
  E: Novetzke cannot be an ambassador because if Novetzke is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned which violates the constraint that only one of them can be assigned.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned as ambassador, it is to Zambia.
  Only one ambassador can be assigned to each of the three countries.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. So Kayne must be assigned to either Zambia or Yemen. We know that if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, if Jaramillo is assigned to Zambia, then Kayne must be assigned to Yemen. Novetzke would be assigned to Venezuela, leaving Landon to be assigned to Zambia. This means that the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Novetzke.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, he must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. 
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it will be to Zambia. Therefore, if Landon is assigned an ambassadorship, the other two ambassadors would have to be assigned to Venezuela and Yemen.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If we assign Novetzke to an ambassadorship, he would have to be assigned to Zambia, which would leave Kayne to be assigned to Venezuela or Yemen. 
  Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon, so the answer is A.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, we know that Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.

Reasoning:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Also, Landon must be assigned to Zambia. Therefore, the only two remaining ambassadors are Jaramillo and Novetzke. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. So we can assign Jaramillo to one ambassadorship, and the remaining one can be assigned to either Kayne or Novetzke.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is assigned as ambassador as well.
  Landon is assigned only to the ambassadorship in Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. So, Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. If Kayne is assigned to Venezuela, then Jaramillo must also be assigned to Venezuela (by the second constraint). In this scenario, Landon is assigned to Zambia and Novetzke is assigned to Yemen. If Kayne is assigned to Zambia, then Landon must be assigned to Zambia (by the third constraint). In this scenario, Jaramillo is assigned to Yemen, and Novetzke is assigned to Venezuela. 
  Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon (Choice A).
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are three countries that need ambassadors: Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia.
  There are five candidates for the ambassadorships: Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Action: Answer("A") 
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, and Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. Therefore, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.

Analysis: 
  Since Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, either Jaramillo or Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Kayne must also be assigned as ambassador to one of the remaining countries (since "if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne"). Therefore, Novetzke would be assigned as ambassador to the remaining country, Zambia. If Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to one of the remaining countries. Therefore, Jaramillo would be assigned as ambassador to the remaining country, Zambia. If Landon is assigned as ambassador to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia since "If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia". Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned would be Kayne and Novetzke. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  2. Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  3. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one. 
  4. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.  
  5. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Novetzke cannot be assigned as ambassador to any country because Novetzke cannot be assigned to Venezuela (because Ong is already assigned there) and Novetzke cannot be assigned to Yemen or Zambia (because the constraint says that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships). Since Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Yemen and Novetzke must be assigned to Venezuela.

  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis: 
  - Choice A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2. According to the given conditions, the breed featured on day 1 should not be featured on day 3. So, it cannot be true. 
  - Choice B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7. According to the given conditions, the breed featured on day 1 should not be featured on day 7. So, it cannot be true.
  - Choice C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4. This is a possible scenario, as long as Himalayans are not featured on day 1, which is one of the given conditions.
  - Choice D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5. According to the given conditions, Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, and Himalayans are featured on exactly three days. Therefore, if Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, they can only be featured on days 2 and 6, which both feature Manx. So, this choice cannot be true.
  - Choice E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6. According to the given conditions, Greyhounds are featured on day 1, and no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, Newfoundlands cannot be featured on day 6. So, this choice cannot be true.

- On day 1, Greyhounds are featured.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: Greyhounds are featured on day 1 so Siamese cannot be featured on day 2 as no breed can be featured two consecutive days. Hence, A is not possible.
B: Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, so Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7. However, Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they can be featured on day 7. Hence, B could be true.
C: Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Also, Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. This means Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4. Hence, C is not possible.
D: Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. This means Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5 since day 5 features Himalayans. Hence, D is not possible.
E: Newfoundlands are not featured on any of the first three days (because Himalayans are not featured on day 1). Hence, Newfoundlands cannot be featured on day 6. Hence, E is not possible.

  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
A: Greyhounds are featured on day 1, and no breed is featured on day 2 since any breed cannot be featured on any two consecutive days. So, Greyhounds and Siamese cannot both be featured on day 2. 
B: Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so the only possible day for them to be featured three times is day 2, 3, and 4. However, any breed cannot be featured two consecutive days, so Himalayans cannot be featured on day 3, and 4. Also, if any breed is featured on day 1, it cannot be featured on day 7. Therefore, Greyhounds and Himalayans cannot both be featured on day 7.
C: Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 2 and 3, which are consecutive. Himalayans must be featured on day 2, 3, and 4, so Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4. Therefore, Rottweilers and Himalayans cannot both be featured on day 4.
D: Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so Manx cannot be featured on day 2. Himalayans must be featured on day 2, 3, and 4, so Manx cannot be featured on day 3 and 4. Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5, so Rottweilers and Manx cannot both be featured on day 5.
E: Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so Newfoundlands cannot be featured on day 2.

A: If Greyhounds are on day 1, then no breed can be featured on day 2. So, this choice is not possible.
B: If Himalayans are not featured on day 1, then they must have been on days 2, 3, and 4, and therefore they cannot be on day 7. So, this choice is not possible.
C: If Himalayans are on day 3 and not on day 1, then the only possible days for Rottweilers are 2, 5, and 6. If Rottweilers are on day 2, it would mean that Himalayans would have to be on day 1, which is not possible. If Rottweilers are on day 6, then Himalayans would have to be on day 7, which is not possible. Therefore, Rottweilers must be on day 5, which makes this choice possible.
D: Rottweilers cannot be on day 5 because that is the day when Himalayans are featured, and Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

- The schedule is 7 days long.
- There are 3 kittens and 3 puppies.
- On each day, one kitten and one puppy are featured.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.

- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly 3 days, but not on day 1.

  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Solution:
- According to the conditions, Greyhounds were featured on day 1. That means Greyhounds cannot be on day 2. Therefore, option A cannot be true.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Therefore, option B cannot be true.
- Himalayans are not featured on day 1, but are featured on exactly three days. Therefore, we can deduce that Himalayans will be featured on days 2, 3, and 4, or days 3, 4, and 5, or days 4, 5, and 6. Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, so the only chance of having both on the same day is when Himalayans are featured on days 4 and 5, and Rottweilers are featured on day 6. Therefore, option C could be true.
- According to the conditions, Manx cannot be featured on day 5. Therefore, option D cannot be true.
- According to the conditions, Newfoundlands cannot be featured on day 7. Therefore, option E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:

  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.

A: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed can be featured on day 2. Siamese cannot be featured on day 1 or day 7, and it must be featured on exactly one of the days between day 2 and day 6. Therefore, Siamese cannot be featured on day 2. This choice is not possible.
B: Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and cannot be featured on day 7. Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

D: Manx cannot be featured on day 1 or day 6. If Manx is featured on day 2, then Rottweiler and Himalayan cannot be featured on day 3 or day 4. If Manx is featured on day 3, then Rottweiler and Himalayan cannot be featured on day 4 and day 5, respectively. If Manx is featured on day 4, then Rottweiler and Himalayan cannot be featured on day 5. Therefore, Rottweiler and Manx can both be featured on day 5. This choice is possible.
E: If Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6, then Rottweiler must be featured on day 7 to satisfy the condition that "Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans." However, this violates the condition that "No breed is featured on any two consecutive days." Therefore, this choice is not possible.

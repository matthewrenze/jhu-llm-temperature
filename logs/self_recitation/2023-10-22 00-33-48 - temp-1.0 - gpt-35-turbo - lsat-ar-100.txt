Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Five students - Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  Each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays.
  Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian. 
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  If Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, which is one of the three available plays, then it is guaranteed that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
  A: It is possible that Megregian could review Undulation, but not necessarily.
  B: It is possible that O'Neill does not review Undulation, but not necessarily.
  C: Jiang cannot review Undulation because neither Lopez nor Megregian can review any play that Jiang reviews and Jiang could only review Undulation.
  D: It is not possible because we already know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  E: It is not possible because we already know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so either of them can review Sunset.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  5 students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill) each review one or more of exactly three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation).
  Kramer and Lopez both review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students cannot review Undulation.
  
Analysis:
  Statement A and statement B do not make sense because if three students reviewed Undulation, then the remaining two students must have reviewed Tamerlane and Sunset.
  Statement C does not make sense because neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews.
  Statement D could be true, as the two remaining students would have reviewed Tamerlane and Sunset, which means that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, and one of the students could be Lopez who reviewed Sunset. We cannot determine which student reviewed Tamerlane and which student reviewed Sunset.
  Statement E does not make sense because if O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer, Lopez, and Megregian must have reviewed Tamerlane and Undulation, which makes five plays in total, which is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly five students review three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  
Analysis:
  - If three of the students review Undulation, the remaining two did not review Undulation.
  - If O'Neill or Megregian is not one of those three students who review Undulation, the student who reviewed only the plays without Undulation (either O'Neill or Megregian) will review exactly the same play or plays as one of the other two students.
  - Therefore, the three students who review Undulation must be those who do not review any of the two plays reviewed by the other two students.
  - If Jiang reviews Undulation, she cannot review any play Megregian or Lopez reviews. Therefore, Megregian can only review Tamerlane and Sunset, while Kramer and Lopez only review Tamerlane. Thus, O'Neill must review Undulation with Jiang.
  - If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then two pairs of students review exactly the same play or plays as each other (O'Neill and Kramer for Tamerlane, and Jiang and Megregian for Sunset). This contradicts with the given condition that exactly two of the students should meet this criterion. Therefore, Lopez cannot review Tamerlane.

Action: Answer("C") 
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The 5 students review exactly 3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
- Kramer and Lopez review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play reviewed by Jiang.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Exactly two students review the same play or plays.
- If three students review the same play, then the remaining two students must also review the same play.
- Total number of students is 5.

Solution:
- Since exactly three students review Undulation, the remaining two students must have reviewed the same play. 
- From the information given, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, they are two students that reviewed the same play.
- Similarly, we also know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play reviewed by Jiang. If Jiang reviewed Undulation, then Lopez and Megregian would have to review it as well since there are only 3 plays to be reviewed. Therefore, Jiang cannot have reviewed Undulation.
- This means we have identified all the students who reviewed Tamerlane and Undulation, leaving only Sunset to be reviewed by the remaining two students. 
- From the given conditions, we see that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must review Sunset.
- We are asked to identify which statement could be true, so we need to examine each option:
  - A: Since there are only three plays, if three students review Undulation, then the remaining two students (Megregian and one other person) must review Tamerlane and Sunset. So it is possible that Megregian does not review Undulation. This option could be true.
  - B: Since we know that Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane and Undulation, the remaining two students (Megregian and one other person) must review Tamerlane and Sunset. Therefore, it is possible that O'Neill does not review Undulation. This option could be true.
  - C: We have already determined that Jiang did not review Undulation, so this option cannot be true.
  - D: According to the given information, we know that Lopez did not review any play reviewed by Jiang. Since we've established that Jiang did not review Undulation, it is not possible for Lopez to review Tamerlane (since Kramer reviewed it) or Sunset (since Megregian reviewed it). Therefore, it is not possible for Lopez to review Tamerlane. This option cannot be true.
  - E: Since we know that Megregian reviewed Sunset and that the other two students reviewed Tamerlane and Sunset, it is not possible for O'Neill to review Sunset. This option cannot be true.
  
Answer: A or B could be true.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Exactly 5 students are reviewing these 3 plays.
  Exactly 2 students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Also, Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  
If 3 of the students review Undulation, then there must be 2 non-Undulation plays that are each being reviewed by 1 student. Therefore:
- The two students who review the same play cannot both review Undulation. 
- Megregian has to review either Undulation or one of the non-Undulation plays reviewed by only one student.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian can review any play Jiang reviews, therefore if Jiang reviews Undulation then there can be at most two students reviewing other plays.

A: Megregian does not review Undulation: This is possible, since Megregian can review one of the two non-Undulation plays that are each being reviewed by 1 student. 

B: O'Neill does not review Undulation: Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, at least one of them has to be reviewing the third play. Therefore, this is not possible.

C: Jiang reviews Undulation: This would mean that only two students are reviewing the other two plays. This violates the condition that exactly 2 students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane: Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, at least one of those students would have to also review Undulation. Therefore, this is not possible.

E: O'Neill reviews Sunset: If exactly 3 students reviewed Undulation, then the remaining two students cannot both be reviewing the same play other than Undulation. This is therefore not possible.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly three of the students review Undulation, so the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  - Kramer and O’Neill both review Tamerlane, so the remaining student must review Undulation.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. 

Using the rules given:
  - Three students review Undulation, so Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.
  - So, the two remaining students did not review Undulation, then Jiang must have reviewed Undulation.
  - Megregian didn’t review Undulation, but reviewed more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
  - Since Kramer reviewed Tamerlane, then Lopez reviewed Sunset.

Analysis of choices:
  A: If exactly three of the students reviewed Undulation, then all the remaining students reviewed Tamerlane. So, this statement can't be true.
  B: This statement can be true. 
  C: Jiang is one of the three students that reviewed Undulation, so this statement is true.
  D: Lopez reviewed Sunset, so this statement can't be true.
  E: O'Neill reviewed Tamerlane, so this statement can't be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Exactly three students review Undulation, and each student reviews one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Analysis:
- If Megregian reviewed Undulation, then the remaining reviewers of Undulation must be two of the other four students (Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, and O'Neill). But, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews. So, Jiang cannot review Undulation. Thus, Megregian didn't review Undulation in this case. Choice A is possible.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, thus neither of them can review Undulation. Thus, O'Neill should not review Undulation. Choice B is possible.
- If Jiang reviewed Undulation, then Megregian, Kramer and Lopez must review the remaining two plays, which are Tamerlane and Sunset. Two of those students must review the same play, but this would be impossible since neither Megregian nor Lopez reviewed the same play as anyone who reviewed Undulation (including Jiang who doesn't review Undulation). Thus choice C is not possible.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Since exactly three of the students review Undulation, there should be one pair among those three students who review the same play. Thus, Lopez and O'Neill cannot both review Tamerlane. Thus, Choice D is not possible.
- Both Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, thus neither of them can review Sunset. Thus, O'Neill can only review Undulation. Choice E is possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- There are 5 students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
- Each student reviewed one or more of the three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
- Kramer and Lopez each reviewed fewer than Megregian.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play Jiang reviewed.
- Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane.
- Exactly two of the students reviewed exactly the same play or plays as each other.
- If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then there must be either one or two students who did not review Undulation.
- Only one student can review a single play, thus at most two students can review the same play.
 
Analysis: 
- If exactly three students review Undulation, that means the other two students did not review Undulation.
- Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane. This means they could not have reviewed Undulation, or otherwise, there would be more than three students who reviewed Undulation. Therefore, neither Kramer nor O'Neill reviewed Undulation.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play Jiang reviewed. We know three students reviewed Undulation, so it could be that Jiang reviewed Undulation, and Lopez and Megregian also reviewed it. Or Lopez or Megregian reviewed it alongside another play not reviewed by Jiang.

Action: 
- Option A is true since we know that Megregian did not review Undulation.
Answer: A
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Five students review exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  
  We are given that three of the students review Undulation. We need to determine which of the answer choices could be true based on this.
  
  A: We cannot guarantee that Megregian must review Undulation if exactly three of the students review it.
  B: We cannot guarantee that O'Neill does not review Undulation if exactly three of the students review it.
  C: If exactly three of the students review Undulation and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews, then Jiang cannot review Undulation. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
  D: We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so it is not possible for Lopez to review Tamerlane if exactly two students share the same review. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
  E: We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so if exactly two of the students review the same play, they could not both review Sunset. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Five students reviewed one or more out of three plays Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation
- Kramer and Lopez reviews fewer than Megregian out of the aforementioned plays.
- Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Exactly two of the students reviewed the same play/plays.

Action: 
First, let's see which play could be reviewed by the students who reviewed Undulation.
- There are three students who reviewed Undulation, and two students reviewed the same play as each other. Thus,
  - Either one student reviewed only Undulation, and two other students reviewed Undulation and the same play as each other
  - Or all the three students reviewed two of the three available plays i.e. one play was reviewed by two students, and the other two students reviewed the other two plays.
- Now, if Jiang reviewed Undulation, neither Lopez nor Megregian can review it. Therefore, option C is False.
- We also know that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane. Hence, option B and E are False.
- Now, to satisfy the condition "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other", we can have one of the following two cases:
  - Kramer and Lopez review the same play, OR
  - Megregian and another student reviews the same game.
- In the first case, only one student can review only Undulation i.e. the other two students who reviewed Undulation must also have reviewed the same play as each other, which cannot happen as we already know Kramer and Lopez both reviewed fewer plays than Megregian. Thus, the first case cannot hold.
- In the second case, either Kramer or Lopez reviewed one play, and Megregian and the other student reviewed two plays. For this to satisfy all the given conditions, Megregian must review Tamerlane along with O'Neill, and the third student (either Kramer or Lopez) must review Sunset. Therefore, the remaining student who did not review Undulation must review only Tamerlane. Thus, A and D are False.
Therefore, the only option that could be true is B. Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The six targets are divided into three categories: website targets (for requests received through the maintenance company's website) and voicemail targets (for requests received by voicemail). The targets are: [1] 1-day, [2] 2-day, and [3] 3-day. Two targets are set for each client—one for website requests and one for voicemail requests. 
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. 
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis: 
  A 1-day website target can be set for more than one client (although we do not know which clients these would be).
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for more than one client.
  A 2-day website target cannot be set for both Solide and Truvest because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, it can be set for only one of them. 
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for more than one client.
  A 3-day website target cannot be set for any client because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The targets for response time for the service requests from three clients have to be set in a way that adheres to the following conditions:
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
A: A 1-day website target can be set for more than one of the clients, as long as it does not conflict with the other conditions.
B: A 2-day voicemail target can be set for more than one of the clients, as long as it does not conflict with the other conditions.
C: A 2-day website target can be set for Solide and/or Truvest, but not for Image, as it would conflict with the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter.
D: A 3-day voicemail target can be set for more than one of the clients, as long as it does not conflict with the other conditions.
E: A 3-day website target can be set for Solide and Truvest or for Truvest only, but not for Image, as it would conflict with the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are three clients, and two targets for each client (one for website requests and one for voicemail requests)
  Service targets can be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter the other clients' voicemail targets
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target
  
Analyzing the choices:
  A: a 1-day website target can be set for multiple clients
  B: a 2-day voicemail target can be set for multiple clients
  C: a 2-day website target can be set for multiple clients
  D: a 3-day voicemail target can be set for multiple clients
  E: a 3-day website target can't be set for multiple clients because None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client: one for requests received through the website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The following conditions must be met:
  1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
  A 1-day website target can be set for all three clients or for none of the clients.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients or for none of the clients.
  A 2-day website target cannot be set for all three clients because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients or for none of the clients.
  A 3-day website target cannot be set for all three clients because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - There are two targets per client: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - There are three possible service targets: 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
A 1-day website target can be set for all three clients, as well as a 1-day voicemail target. A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients, as well as a 3-day website target. A 2-day website target can be set for any combination of clients other than Solide and Truvest, as long as the client's voicemail target is longer than their website target. A 3-day voicemail target can be set for any combination of clients other than Image and a 3-day website target can be set for Solide and Truvest. Therefore, the only target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients is a 2-day website target.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
- There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- Two service targets for each client are set—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Solide's website target must be set shorter than Truvest's website target.

A: a 1-day website target could be set for more than one client if the conditions allow it to happen. So, it's not the answer.
B: a 2-day voicemail target could be set for more than one client if the conditions allow it to happen. So, it's not the answer.
C: a 2-day website target could be set for more than one client based on the given conditions. Solide's website target should be shorter than Truvest's website target, so at least one of them would need to have a 2-day website target. Then, Image could also have a 2-day website target if that is shorter than the voicemail target. So this option is not the answer.
D: a 3-day voicemail target could be set for more than one client based on the given conditions. It's not the answer.
E: a 3-day website target cannot be set for more than one client because none of the clients' website target can be longer than its voicemail target. Also, the maximum website target for each client is 2 days. Therefore, a 3-day website target cannot be set for any of the clients.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The six targets are: Image's website target, Image's voicemail target, Solide's website target, Solide's voicemail target, Truvest's website target, Truvest's voicemail target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
- A 1-day website target can be set for both Solide and Truvest. Image cannot have a 1-day website target because Image's voicemail target has to be shorter.
- A 2-day voicemail target can be set for both Image and Solide. Truvest cannot have a 2-day voicemail target because Truvest's website target has to be shorter than Solide's website target, which is already at 2 days.
- A 2-day website target can be set for both Image and Solide. Truvest's website target must be shorter than Solide's website target, but Truvest can still have a 2-day website target.
- A 3-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients.
- A 3-day website target can be set for all three clients.
Response 7:

  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  A: a 1-day website target can be set for both Solide and Truvest, as this condition does not restrict the target being set for more than one client.
  B: a 2-day voicemail target can be set for both Solide and Truvest, as this condition does not restrict the target being set for more than one client.
  C: a 2-day website target can be set for both Image and Solide, as this condition does not restrict the target being set for more than one client.
  D: a 3-day voicemail target can be set for both Image and Solide, as this condition does not restrict the target being set for more than one client.
  E: a 3-day website target can be set for both Image and Truvest, as this condition does not restrict the target being set for more than one client.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")  
Note: There is no target according to the given conditions that cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The targets are determined by different clients and their requests through different methods, which involve creating targets for each client with two targets for each client. 
  To determine each target, there are three clients to consider: Image, Solide, and Truvest. 
  Two targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:

  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2). 
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Each trade must be of exactly of one kind: "Trading one building for one other building of the same class", "Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings", and "Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings".

Elimination:
  Options A and C contain the Flores Tower in Southco's ownership, which cannot be involved in a trade due to being a class 1 building.
  Option B contains class 1 and class 3 buildings in Trustcorp's ownership, which cannot be traded for any combinations of buildings.
  Option D contains Meyer Building in RealProp's ownership, which cannot be owned by them as it is owned by Trustcorp.
  Option E:
    RealProp would trade Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings, King Building and Ortiz Building. 
    Southco would trade Lynch Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings, Yates House and Zimmer House. 
    Trustcorp would trade King Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings, either Yates House or Zimmer House and either Yates House or Zimmer House. 
    This option satisfies the constraint provided in the question.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. RealProp owns 3 buildings, 1 of class 1 and 2 of class 3.
  2. Southco owns 2 buildings, 1 of class 1 and 1 of class 2.
  3. Trustcorp owns 3 buildings, all of class 2.
  4. Trades can only happen between the same class (1 for 1, 1 for 2, or 2 for 3).
Analysis:
  - RealProp has a class 1 building, it can be traded only for 2 class 2 buildings or a class 1 building of another company.
  - Southco has only one class 1 building, it can only trade it for 2 class 2 buildings.
  - Trustcorp has only class 2 building, it can only trade it for 2 class 3 buildings or a class 2 building of another company.
  - So if RealProp trades its class 1 Garza Tower, it can only trade it with Southco's Flores Tower and get Lynch Building.
Action:
  Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Each real estate company owns buildings of different classes.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class. 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Only one trade is made.
  
Analysis:
  - RealProp has one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings, it cannot exchange its class 1 building for two class 2 building. Thus the company must either trade one building for another building of the same class or trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. 
  - Southco has one class 1 building and one class 2 building, it cannot exchange any class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, thus it must either trade one building for another building of the same class or trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. 
  - Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings and cannot trade any of them for two class 3 buildings, thus it must either trade a class 2 building for a building of the same class or trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.

Solution:
  From the companies' buildings and the possible trades, there are two possible ways to trade that would satisfy the exchange rules.
  - RealProp trades the Yates House(class 3) with Trustcorp's Meyer Building(class 2)
  - Trustcorp trades the Meyer Building(class 2) with Southco's Lynch Building(class 2)
  
Analyzing this solution with the answer choices:
  A. RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building: Not possible since RealProp would need to trade one building for two class 2 buildings
  B. RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House: Not possible since Trustcorp has no class 1 building to trade
  C. RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building: Not possible since neither RealProp nor Southco trade a class 2 building
  D. RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House: Not possible since RealProp trades a class 3 building, but gets a class 2 building in return
  E. RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building: Possible by trading Yates House with Meyer Building and trading Meyer Building with Lynch Building. Thus, this is the correct answer.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: Three companies are trading their buildings with one another, each building they own is categorized as class 1, class 2, or class 3. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
Trading one building for one other building of the same class
Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

A: RealProp owns only one class 1 building, but it must be traded with two class 2 buildings, which is not possible. The combination as a whole is also not possible, because RealProp owns two class 3 buildings and both of them must be traded for class 2 or class 1 buildings.
B: RealProp cannot own the King Building since it is a class 2 building and it would have to be traded for two class 3 buildings. Southco owns two buildings but they are of class 1 and class 2, and they have to be traded with the same class building, thus B is an invalid combination.
C: This is a possible combination as each class 2 building must be traded for two class 3 buildings and each class 1 building must be traded for two class 2 buildings. This combination meets the requirements of the trades.
D: RealProp cannot trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings because it only owns one class 1 building. The combination as a whole is also not possible, because RealProp owns two class 3 buildings and both of them must be traded for class 2 or class 1 buildings, but this combination includes one class 3 and one class 2 building.
E: This combination is not possible because it does not trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings or a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns three buildings with the value of class 1 and class 3.
  Southco owns two buildings, one with the value of class 1 and the other with the value of class 2.
  Trustcorp owns three buildings, all with the value of class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  
Elimination:
  Option A includes RealProp owning the Flores Tower which is not possible due to RealProp owning class 1 and 3 buildings.
  Option B includes Trustcorp owning both the Yates House and Ortiz Building, which is not possible due to these buildings being of different classes.
  Option D includes Meyer Building, which is not possible due to 
    - the Meyer Building being owned by Trustcorp and 
    - class 2 building can only be traded with two class 3 buildings.
  Options C and E include valid combination of buildings for each company.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the following buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the following buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
  1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
  2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
  3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  
Analysis: 
  One possible trade that satisfies the criterion is to trade Garza Tower of RealProp for Flores Tower of Southco through exchange of class 1 buildings. In this trade, both buildings are of the same class. The final ownership of buildings become:
  RealProp: Flores Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco: Garza Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  
  Option A, B, C, D does not satisfy the conditions for a legal trade, but Option E has the possibility of being traded through exchange of class 1 buildings, similar to the above mentioned trade.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  2. The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.

A: RealProp has Garza Tower (class 1) and Southern has Flores Tower (class 1). In order to get two class 2 Trustcorp buildings, RealProp has to trade Garza Tower. But, doing that, they're left with class 3 buildings, which cannot be traded for class 2 buildings. So, this is not possible.

B: RealProp has a mix of class 1 and class 3 buildings. Southern has both class 1 and class 2 buildings. Trustcorp has class 2 buildings. There is no way for RealProp to acquire one more class 2 building, which would be necessary to complete the trades. Therefore, this is not possible either.

C: RealProp has a mix of class 1 and class 3 buildings. Southern has both class 1 and class 2 buildings. Trustcorp has class 2 buildings. RealProp can trade its Garza Tower (class 1) for Flores Tower (class 1), Southern can trade Lynch Building (class 2) for both Yates House and Zimmer House (both class 3), and Trustcorp can keep its three Class 2 buildings. This is a valid trade, therefore the answer is (C).

D: RealProp has a mix of class 1 and class 3 buildings. Southern has both class 1 and class 2 buildings. Trustcorp has class 2 buildings. There is no way for RealProp to acquire two class 2 buildings, which would be necessary to complete the trades. Thus, this is not possible.

E: RealProp has only one Class 1, which needs to be traded for two Class 2. But, if Garza Tower is traded away, there is no way to complete the rest of the trades according to the class requirement. Therefore, this is not possible as well.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
  1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
  2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
  3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

A: RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1), hence A is not possible. 

B: RealProp's Garza Tower and any class 1 building cannot trade for two class 2 buildings. For this reason, choice B is not possible.

C: RealProp can trade Garza Tower (class 1) for Meyers Building (class 2). The second trade could be the Lynch Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings, such as Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3). Similar trades could be made and still fit the criteria. Therefore, C is a possible answer.

D: The Meyer Building is part of Trustcorp's assets, which are all class 2. Therefore, RealProp's Garza Tower and Yates House as well as Southco's Flores Tower and Lynch Building cannot be traded for buildings from Trustcorp assets. Hence, D is not possible.

E: The Yates House and Zimmer House have the same value (class 3), so they cannot be traded for a class 1 building. Therefore, RealProp's buildings are not exchangeable in this scenario. Additionally, Trustcorp's three buildings are all class 2 buildings, so they cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings. Therefore, E is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Each trade must be of one of the following three kinds:
  1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
  2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
  3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

  RealProp owns:
  - the Garza Tower (class 1)
  - the Yates House (class 3)
  - the Zimmer House (class 3)

  Southco owns:
  - the Flores Tower (class 1)
  - the Lynch Building (class 2)
  
  Trustcorp owns:
  - the King Building (class 2)
  - the Meyer Building (class 2)
  - the Ortiz Building (class 2)

Analysis: 
  To do a trade, one company needs to give up one building to the other company or companies in exchange for one or two different buildings. The building(s) being traded must be of the same class or they must follow the conditions for trade number 2 or number 3. 

  A, B, C, and D are impossible because they require the trade of a class 1 for two class 2 buildings, which is not possible. Choice E is possible because it involves trading a class 1 building (the Garza Tower) for two class 2 buildings (the King Building and the Ortiz Building), which is permitted by the rules. Then Trustcorp can trade one of its class 2 buildings (the Meyer Building) for two class 3 buildings (the Yates House and the Zimmer House), which means each company ends up with three properties, and the classes work out as follows:

  RealProp:
  - the Garza Tower (class 1)
  - the Yates House (class 3)
  - the Zimmer House (class 3)

  Southco:
  - the Flores Tower (class 1)
  - the Lynch Building (class 2)

  Trustcorp:
  - the King Building (class 2)
  - the Ortiz Building (class 2)
  - the Meyer Building (class 2) -> [trade with two class 3 buildings]
  - the Yates House (class 3) -> [trade with one class 2 building]
  - the Zimmer House (class 3) -> [trade with one class 2 building]

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - The companies can only trade buildings of the same class or follow one of the three trade types mentioned in the prompt.
  - RealProp has buildings of class 1 and 2.
  - Southco has buildings of class 1 and 2.
  - Trustcorp has buildings of class 2 only.
  
A: In this option, RealProp is trading a class 1 building for another class 1 and also trading the class 3 buildings for class 2 buildings. Thus, this option is not valid.
B: In this option, RealProp is trading a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. This means RealProp should own two class 2 buildings and one class 3 building. However, RealProp owns only one class 2 building in the beginning and thus this option is not valid.
C: In this option, the trading is possible as RealProp is trading a class 1 building for another class 1 building and taking a class 2 building for the class 3 building. Southco is trading a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. And Trustcorp is trading a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. Thus, this option could be valid.
D: In this option, RealProp is trading a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. This means RealProp should own two class 2 buildings and one class 3 building. However, RealProp owns only one class 2 building in the beginning and thus this option is not valid.
E: In this option, RealProp is trading a class 1 building for another class 1 building and also trading the two class 3 buildings for a class 2 building. Thus, this option is not valid.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z
  - Chapters: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7
  - T cannot be in chapter 1
  - T must be before W with two chapters separating them
  - S and Z cannot be adjacent
  - W and X cannot be adjacent
  - U and X must be adjacent
  
We know that U is mentioned in chapter 3. We need to find an option that is consistent with the given constraints.

Option A: We don't know where R will be mentioned, so this option is not useful.

Option B: We don't know where R or T will be mentioned, so this option is not useful.

Option C: We don't know where S or Z will be mentioned, so this option is not useful.

Option D: If W is in chapter 6, T must be in chapter 2 and X in chapter 7. So, U will be in chapter 3, R in chapter 1, and S and Z in chapters 4 and 5 in some order. This option is consistent with the constraints.

Option E: If X is in chapter 4, T must be in chapter 2, and W must be in chapter 7. So, U will be in chapter 3, R in chapter 1, and S and Z in chapters 5 and 6 in some order. This option is not consistent with the constraint that W cannot be adjacent to X.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - There are 7 chapters numbered 1 through 7.
  - There are certain constraints on the order of mentioning the clues as follows:
      * T cannot be mentioned in Chapter 1
      * T must be mentioned before W.
      * T must be separated by exactly 2 chapters from W.
      * S, Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
      * W, X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
      * U, X must be in adjacent chapters.

Given the constraints, if U is mentioned in chapter 3, then we can infer the following:
- U=X or U is in an adjacent chapter to X.
- Neither W nor X can be mentioned in chapter 2. 
- If T is not in chapter 1 or 2, then it can only be in chapter 3, 4, or 5.
- If T is in chapter 3, then R must be mentioned in Chapter 1, and S can be in chapter 2 or 4.
- If T is in chapter 4, then R can be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5, and S is possible in chapter 2 or 6 (but not chapter 5).
- If T is in chapter 5, then R must be mentioned in chapter 1, and S can be in chapter 2 or 4.

Choices:
A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.  --> Possible if T is in chapter 3.
B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.  --> Possible if T is in chapter 4.
C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.  --> Possible if T is in chapter 4 or 5, and S can be in chapter 2 or 6.
D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.  --> Impossible as W must be mentioned after T, which has to be in chapter 3, 4, or 5, thus W can be placed only in chapter 7.
E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.  --> Possible if T is in chapter 4, and U must be adjacent to X and thus be in chapter 3 or 5, and S can be placed in chapters 2 or 6.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7.
  - Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  
  A: There is no indication about the position of R relative to U. Therefore, R can be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5. However, if R is mentioned in chapter 1, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, A is not possible. 
  B: If R is mentioned in chapter 5, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, because U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, B is not possible. 
  C: There is no restriction on the order in which S and Z are mentioned, but they cannot be in adjacent chapters. Therefore, C is possible.
  D: If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, D is not possible. 
  E: If X is mentioned in chapter 4, U must be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, E is possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  2. Each of the seven clues must appear exactly once in one of the seven chapters.
  3. Clue T cannot appear in Chapter 1, it must appear before clue W, and there must be exactly two chapters between T and W.
  4. Clues S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  5. Clues W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  6. Clues U and X must be in adjacent chapters.

Chapter 2 would come after Chapter 1 and Chapter 4 would follow Chapter 3. Therefore, it is impossible for X to appear in Chapter 4, as U and X must be in adjacent chapters, and they are in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively.

Let's check the rest of the options.
A: It is not possible for R to be in Chapter 1 as U is in Chapter 3.
B: If T is mentioned in either Chapter 2 or Chapter 5, it is possible to mention R in Chapter 5, before T. Therefore, B could be true.
C: It is not possible to place S in Chapter 6 as it would violate constraint 4.
D: W must follow T, with two chapters between them. This means if T is in Chapter 1, W would have to be in Chapter 4. As we know, U is in Chapter 3, so it is not possible for W to be in Chapter 6.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
- U is mentioned in chapter 3.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and must be mentioned before W, separated by two chapters, which means that T can be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3 only.
- W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- Each chapter must be assigned a different clue and each clue must be used exactly once.
- We can use the constraints to eliminate some of the choices that cannot be true.
- Since we know that U must be next to X, there are only two possible combinations for chapters 3 and 4: U and X in either order.
- If U is mentioned in chapter 3, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2.
- From the constraint that W must be mentioned two chapters after T, W must be mentioned in either chapter 5 or chapter 6.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 6.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The mystery novel consists of seven chapters with seven different clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating their mention.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: 
Clue U is mentioned in chapter 3 and we have to determine which option could be true.
Given option A: We know that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. And if R is mentioned in chapter 1, it means chapters 2 and 3 must be occupied. In this case, chapter 4 must contain either S or Z. This violates the rule that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, option A is not possible.

Option B: If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or 3 and W must be mentioned in one of chapters 5, 6 or 7. Chapter 4 must contain X. Then, W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which is possible based on the constraint. Therefore, option B could be true.

Option C: If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6. But between chapters 6 and 7, it's impossible to have either T or W mentioned which violates the constraints. Therefore, option C is not possible.

Option D: If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or 3, and X must be mentioned in chapter 4. Chapter 5 must contain either R or S. Then, in chapter 7, the remaining clue (either S or Z based on the previous arrangement) would need to be mentioned. This arrangement satisfies all constraints. Therefore, option D could be true.

Option E: If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then U must be mentioned in chapter 3 and T must be mentioned in chapter 2, W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 6. Chapter 1 must contain either R or S, but that would violate the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, option E is not possible.

Therefore, we can conclude that options B and D are possible arrangements and we only have to select one. As the question doesn't ask for all possible options, there is more than one correct answer. 
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z) that are to be mentioned exactly once and one per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, but must be before W with a separation of two chapters.
  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters, but U and X must be in the adjacent chapters.
  
Searching for the best possible answer using the given constraint:
- Since U is mentioned in chapter 3, X and W must be in chapter 2 and chapter 4.
- S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, out of S and Z, only Z is left so Z is in Chapter 1 or Chapter 7.
- The remaining clues that must be fitted in are R and T
- T cannot be in chapter 1 due to constraint so T is in chapter 5.
- R is left to be in Chapter 1 and Chapter 7. 
- According to constraints, Z is not in chapter 2. W is in Chapter 6 along with U, which means neither R nor S is in Chapter 6.
  
Action: Answer("D") - W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven chapters in the mystery novel that must mention seven different clues exactly once per chapter.
  - The clues and chapters are: R in ch.1, S in ch.2, T in ch.3, U in ch.4, W in ch.6, X in ch.7, Z in ch.5.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W and must have exactly two chapters separating them.
  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.

Action: 
If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then clue T cannot be in chapter 1 or chapter 2. The only position for T is in chapter 4. 
That means that there can only be the following sequence (with S and Z in any order):
Ch.1: R
Ch.2: S/Z
Ch.3: None for T
Ch.4: U
Ch.5: Z/S
Ch.6: W
Ch.7: X

Therefore, the only possibility is that X is in chapter 7.
The correct answer is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- There are seven clues, each of which is used in exactly one chapter.
- The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to a number of constraints.
- T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
- T must be mentioned before W, with two chapters separating T and W.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Recall that U is mentioned in chapter 3. From the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, we know that X is either mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.

Knowledge:
- If X is mentioned in chapter 2, then the only two possible clues that could be mentioned in chapter 1 are R and Z.
- If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, and the only clue that could be mentioned in chapter 1 is Z.

The possible scenarios are:
- If U is mentioned in chapter 3 and X is mentioned in chapter 2, then R could be mentioned in chapter 1.
- If U is mentioned in chapter 3 and X is mentioned in chapter 4, then Z could be mentioned in chapter 1.

Scenario A:

Chapter 1: R or Z
Chapter 2: X
Chapter 3: U
Chapter 4: T
Chapter 5: W
Chapter 6: R or Z
Chapter 7: S

In this scenario, R or Z must appear in chapter 1, and X must appear in chapter 2. However, if R appears in chapter 1, then W must appear in chapter 7, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, only Z can appear in chapter 1.

Scenario B:

Chapter 1: Z
Chapter 2: T
Chapter 3: U
Chapter 4: X
Chapter 5: R
Chapter 6: W
Chapter 7: S

In this scenario, Z appears in chapter 1, and U and X are adjacent in chapters 3 and 4, respectively. This satisfies all of the constraints.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z are arranged in 7 chapters.
  T is not mentioned in chapter 1.
  T precedes W by two chapters.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Working through the constraints:
 - Since U is mentioned in chapter 3, X must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or chapter 4.
 - Also, since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, X must be mentioned in chapter 4 if U is mentioned in chapter 3.
 - Since W cannot be adjacent to X and it follows T with two other chapters between them, W must be mentioned in either chapter 6 or chapter 7. 
 - Clues S and Z cannot be adjacent. Thus, neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 6, if W is mentioned in chapter 7.

Analysis:
 - R cannot be in chapter 1, as T cannot be in this chapter and T must be before W and two chapters separate T from W. This would mean W is at least in chapter 4 or later.
 - If R is in chapter 5, then T must be in either chapter 2 or 3. Both T and U cannot be in the same chapter. Thus, T cannot be in chapter 2 if U is in chapter 3. So T must be in chapter 3, which means X must be in chapter 4. The clues S and Z must be in chapters 1-2 and 5-7, but their exact arrangement doesn't matter for this question.
 - If S is in chapter 7, Z cannot be in chapter 6, so W and X must be in chapters 4 and 5 in some order. This puts U in chapter 3 and T in chapter 2, eliminating (D) and (E).
 
Action: Answer("C"),
Option (A) is ruled out because R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Option (B) is ruled out because T cannot be in chapter 5 if U is in chapter 3. Option (D) is ruled out because W must be mentioned in either chapter 6 or chapter 7. Thus, the correct answer is (C) S is mentioned in chapter 7.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  1. Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.
  2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play reviewed by Jiang.
  3. Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  4. Only two students out of five review the same play or plays.
  
Using (1), we know that either Kramer or O'Neill or both  review Tamerlane. 
If Kramer and Megregian review the same play, then from (2) Jiang can review only Sunset, which violates the condition that exactly two of the students review the same play or plays.
If Kramer is the only one who reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian should review the other play reviewed by O'Neill (from (1)) i.e. Kramer and Megregian both review two separate plays, which violates condition (4). 
Thus, O'Neill must review another play reviewed by Kramer, meaning he reviews Tamerlane. The remaining play that Kramer could review is Sunset. 
From (3), at least one student must review all three plays, i.e. Megregian reviews all three plays and from (2) Lopez must review Sunset only.
This means the possible accurate and complete list of students who review Tamerlane is: Kramer, O'Neill. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  Three Plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez review less plays than Megregian, which means Megregian needs to review at least 2 plays.
  Kramer and O'Neil review Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews.
  Two of the students need to review the same play or plays as each other.
Action: Answer("B")  
Kramer and O'Neil review Tamerlane, so the answer must have these two students. 
Option A is incorrect because it only has Kramer reviewing Tamerlane and there needs to be at least one additional student to get to two students with the same play.
Option B is correct because it has both Kramer and O'Neill reviewing Tamerlane and no other students have been paired together.
Option C is incorrect because it not only has Kramer and O'Neill reviewing Tamerlane, but it also includes Lopez, who is not paired with anyone for reviewing the same play.
Option D is incorrect because it has O'Neill and Kramer that are paired together, but then it also includes Megregian, which means there would be three students paired together, and the problem only allows for two students.
Option E is incorrect because it only includes students that review the same play Undulation but no one reviewing Tamerlane.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
- Kramer and O’Neill both review Tamerlane. 
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. 
- Five students are Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.

Based on these conditions, the list of students that could have reviewed 'Tamerlane' must include both Kramer and O'Neill. Therefore, the accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane is: 

Action: Answer("B") Kramer, O'Neill
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  None of Lopez, Megregian or Jiang review any of the same plays as Kramer and O'Neill.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

For the purposes of the question, we can construct a chart with the students' names and the plays they reviewed to better visualize the information.

| Students | Sunset | Tamerlane | Undulation |
|----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Jiang    | Yes     | No        | Yes        |
| Kramer   | Yes     | Yes       | No         |
| Lopez    | No      | No        | Yes        |
| Megregian| No      | Yes       | Yes        |
| O'Neill  | Yes     | Yes       | No         |

Action: Answer("B") 
Using the chart, we can see that the only option that satisfies the condition that both Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane is option B. None of the other options have both Kramer and O'Neill reviewing Tamerlane. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The only students who review Tamerlane are Kramer and O'Neill.
  A: Jiang is not reviewing Tamerlane.
  B: This is a possible accurate and complete list of students who review Tamerlane.
  C: There are three students, but we know only two students reviewed Tamerlane.
  D: Megregian reviews fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez, therefore Megregian is not reviewing Tamerlane.
  E: Lopez and Megregian are not reviewing Tamerlane.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Five students are Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  Students review one or more of three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays.

Applying these conditions:
  Two students must review Tamerlane. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, no other students can review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices (A), (C), and (E).
  To satisfy the condition that no other students review what Jiang reviewed, we need to have Megregian review Sunset or Undulation.
  If Jiang reviews Sunset or Undulation, then Megregian cannot review that play, so she must review the third play.
  In order to have exactly two students review the same play, one of Lopez and Kramer must review play reviewed by Megregian.
  Therefore, one of Lopez and Kramer must review Sunset or Undulation, and they both review fewer plays than Megregian. So, Megregian review `Sunset`, `Undulation`, or both.
  However, if two students review the same two plays, we would need to have either Lopez or Kramer review both Tamerlane and the play reviewed by Megregian, which is not possible. Thus, only two students can review the same play, and none can review two.
  From this, Kramer and O'Neill are the only students who review Tamerlane and no other student can review another play.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  - There are 5 students who review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays.
  - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. 

The students who review Tamerlane will be Kramer and O'Neill. None of the other students can be reviewing Tamerlane since they either review fewer plays or reviewed plays that Jiang did. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play Jiang reviewed.
  Kramer and Lopez each reviewed fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Exactly two of the students reviewed exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Let's try to eliminate some options:
  If we choose option A and include Jiang, then we would have one more student and three plays to review, and only one student available to review the other two plays, which would violate our initial assumption that each student reviews one or more of exactly three plays.
  Option E also is not possible, as it includes three students, meaning one of them would not review any of the plays.
  
  That leaves options B, C, and D, which all include Kramer and O'Neill reviewing Tamerlane, and satisfy the conditions that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other, and that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play reviewed by Jiang.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Question: The organizer must at least select
Choices:
  A: one French novel and one French play
  B: one French novel and one Russian play
  C: one Russian novel and one French play
  D: two French novels
  E: two Russian novels
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The organizer will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works.
  The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play.
  No more than four French works are selected.
  At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
  
To satisfy the conditions, the organizer must select at least one French novel (F), at least one Russian novel (R), at least one French play (Pf), and (Rf) or (Rr) number of French or Russian novels such that maximum number of selected works is six and minimum three of them are novels. We have the following cases

  1. F1, R1, F2, F3, P1 - three French novels are selected (F1, F2, F3), at least one Russian novel is selected (R1), one French play is selected (P1)，the selected works do not violate any of the requirements. So the minimum number of books that the organizer can select is 5.
  2. R1, F1, F2, F3, Pf, Rf - three French novels are selected (F1, F2, F3), at least one Russian novel is selected (R1), one French play is selected (Pf), one Russian novel is selected (Rf), and the selected works do not violate any of the requirements. So the minimum number of books that the organizer can select is 6.
  
The only option that satisfies the conditions of the question is A. Because the organizer must include at least one French novel and at least one French play, options B, C, D, and E are not valid. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The organizer of a reading club is selecting at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works consisting of:
  - three French novels
  - three Russian novels
  - two French plays
  - one Russian play.
  The organizer's selection must conform to the following requirements:
  - No more than four French works are selected.
  - At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
  - At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  - If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

To find the least number of works the organizer can select, we look for the most restrictive requirement among the given options above, which is to select "At least three but no more than four novels are selected." 

Action: Answer("C") => one Russian novel and one French play.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The organizer will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. 
  The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
  No more than 4 French works are selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. 
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Eliminating choices:
  A: This option would include one French novel and one French play, which would add up 2 French works. Also, the option does not satisfy the requirements stated regarding minimum number of novels and maximum number of French works. So, this choice cannot be correct.
  B: This option would include one French novel and one Russian play. Such a combined choice does not seem to violate any stated requirement, but alone this selection does not meet the minimum number of novels required. Hence, this choice cannot be correct. 
  C: This option would include one Russian novel and one French play. While this combined choice satisfies the minimum number of novels requirement, alone it does not meet the minimum number of French novels requirement. So this choice cannot be correct either. 
  D: This option would include two French novels. The maximum number of French works allowed is four, which means that this selection does not violate any of the requirements. This might be the correct choice but let's verify with the other options. 
  E: This option would include two Russian novels. Although the question does not have any upper limit regarding the number of Russian works, selecting only Russian novels won't help in satisfying the requirement of having at least as many French novels as Russian novels. Hence, this option cannot be correct.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The organizer will select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works, including 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and one Russian play.
  No more than 4 French works can be selected.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Eliminating choices:
  A: This option does not meet the requirement of at least 3 but no more than 4 novels to be selected. Also, selecting one French novel and one French play would exceed the limit of selecting a maximum of four French works.
  B: This option does not fulfill the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels
  C: This option does not fulfill the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels
  D: This option meets all requirements. The organizer can select two French novels, two Russian novels, and one French play. Total of 5 works. It is also possible to select one more work, as long as the work is not a French work, that will fulfill the requirements of the problem.
  E: This option does not fulfill the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The organizer must select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works.
  The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play.
  The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements:
    * No more than four French works are selected.
    * At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
    * At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
    * If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
    
Analysis:
  To meet the requirements:
  - The organizer must select at least 3 novels. At most, he can select 4 novels. But given the choice, the selection will not contain only 3 novels.
  - The organizer can select up to 4 French works. So, if he needs to select 4 novels, then he must select one Russian novel as he can select only up to 3 French novels.
  - If he selects two French plays, then he must select at least four French works which is against the requirement. So, he will select at most one French play.
  - If he selects one French play, he will select at least one French novel.  
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The organizer must select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works.
  - The group consists of 3 French Novels, 3 Russian Novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
  - No more than 4 French works are allowed to be selected, which means a combination of the 3 French Novels and the 2 French plays must be less than or equal to 4 works.
  - At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected, which means a combination of French novels and Russian novels must be between 3 and 4.
  - At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected, which means the organizer can select 3 French novels and 3 Russian novels at most.
  - If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Based on the given context, the organizer must select at least 3 novels, and at most 6 works. The combinations of works to satisfy the given conditions are:
  - Two French plays cannot be selected together with the Russian play.
  - Selecting three Russian novels means selecting at least three French novels.
  - There should be at least 3 novels, and at most 4 novels.
  - At most 4 French works can be selected.
Satisfying the conditions, the organizer must select 2 French novels and 2 Russian novels. This leaves us with 5 works in total. Since we can select up to 6 works, we can add another French novel to the selection. Therefore, the organizer must select at least two French novels. Answer option D is the only option that represents selecting two French novels. 
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The selection must conform to the following requirements:
  - No more than four French works are selected.
  - At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
  - At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  - If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Option A: This is not possible as it violates the requirement of selecting at least three but no more than four novels since it only includes one novel.
Option B: This is not possible since it includes a Russian play and at least as many French novels as Russian novels need to be selected.
Option C: This may be possible as it satisfies all the requirements. One French play and one Russian novel will be additional to at least one French novel and one Russian novel that need to be selected.
Option D: This may be possible but we cannot be sure without knowing if selecting two French novels will violate the "no more than four French works" requirement.
Option E: This may be possible but we cannot be sure as we do not know if selecting two Russian novels will violate the "at least as many French novels as Russian novels" requirement.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The organizer will select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works. 
- The group consists of: 
  - 3 French novels
  - 3 Russian novels
  - 2 French plays
  - 1 Russian play
- The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements:
  - No more than 4 French works are selected.
  - At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  - At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  - If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
  
Analysis:
- The minimum number of works that the organizer must select is 5.
- The number of novels selected must be at least 3, so either: 
  - 3 novels are selected (2 from one language and 1 from the other) 
  - 4 novels are selected (2 from each language).
- The number of French novels must be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels. 
- The organizer cannot select both French plays and the Russian play.
- The organizer can select at most 4 French works, and since there are only 5 French works to choose from, at least one French work must be selected.

Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
- The organizer can select one French novel and one French play while meeting all requirements. 
- This gives a total of 2 French works, 1 Russian play, and either 2 French novels and 1 Russian novel or 1 French novel and 2 Russian novels, satisfying all other constraints. 
- Therefore, the minimum number of works that the organizer must select is one French novel and one French play.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The organizer must select at least five and at most six works of the nine available works, which are: 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
- The organizer can select at most 4 French works. This means that they can select either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 French works.
- At least three but no more than four novels must be selected. Since there are 6 novels in total (3 French and 3 Russian), the organizer can select any combination of 3 or 4 novels.
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. This means that if the organizer selects 3 novels, they must select at least 2 French novels and 1 Russian novel. If they select 4 novels, they must select exactly 2 French novels and 2 Russian novels.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected. This means that the organizer can either select: 0, 1, or 2 French plays, but if they select 2 French plays, then they cannot select the Russian play.

Analysis:
- A: This choice is not correct, as it does not meet the requirement of selecting at least 3 novels.
- B: This choice is not correct, because it fails to meet the condition of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
- C: This choice is not correct, as it does not meet the requirement of selecting at least 3 novels.
- D: This choice could be correct. If the organizer selects two French novels, they can still select either 1 or 2 French plays and 1 or 2 Russian novels to meet all the requirements.
- E: This choice is not correct, as it fails to meet the condition of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The organizer must select at least 5 works
  The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
  No more than 4 French works are selected
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: To satisfy the requirements, the organizer must select at least one French and one Russian novel, which leaves space for one or two more novels. If we select both French novels, we can only select one French play, which we can't do because we must select at least one French novel and one French play. Thus, we must not select both French plays, which means we can select the Russian play. We have now selected at most 2 French novels (and at least 1), at most 2 French plays, and at least 1 Russian novel (because we have already selected 1). At this point, we can select either 1 or 2 Russian novels, depending on how many novels we want to select in total (which must be at least 3 and at most 4). In any case, we have at least one French novel and one French play, as well as at least one Russian novel and one French play, which satisfies the requirements. Thus, the organizer must at least select 1 Russian novel and 1 French play.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns 3 buildings of class 1 and class 3.
  Southco owns 2 buildings of class 1 and 2.
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings of class 2.
  Trades can only occur between buildings of the same class or between a class 1 building and two class 2 buildings or between a class 2 building and two class 3 buildings.
 
A: RealProp does not own the Flores Tower. 
B: Southco does not own any class 3 buildings and Trustcorp does not own the Yates House. 
C: RealProp owns the Garza Tower so Southco cannot own it. 
D: Trustcorp does not own the Flores Tower. 
E: RealProp does not own the Meyer Building or the Ortiz Building. 

Action: Answer("A")  
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). 
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building (class 2), the Meyer Building (class 2), and the Ortiz Building (class 2).
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    1- Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    2- Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    3- Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis: 
- If the buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower, they would both be class 1 buildings, so they could be traded for two class 2 buildings, but RealProp does not own any class 2 building to make the trade, so A could be true.
- If the buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building, they would be class 1 and class 2 respectively, which means they cannot be traded for each other or for any other building, so B cannot be true.
- If the buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, they would be class 1 and class 2 respectively, which means they cannot be traded for each other or for any other building, so C cannot be true.
- If the buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building, they would be two class 1 buildings, so they could be traded for two class 2 buildings, but Trustcorp does not own any other class 1 building to make the trade, so D could be true.
- If the buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building, they would be class 1 and class 2 respectively, which means they cannot be traded for each other or for any other building, so E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns buildings of class 1 and class 3.
  Southco owns buildings of class 1 and class 2.
  Trustcorp owns buildings of class 2.
  Class 1 buildings have higher value than class 2 and class 3 buildings.
  The trades have to be between buildings of the same class or follow the specific rules that are mentioned.
  Any particular building can be involved in only one trade.
Analysis:
  A: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, so this statement implies that RealProp also owns the Flores Tower, which is not possible.
  B: If Southco owns the Flores Tower, it cannot own the Meyer Building since they are of different classes. Hence, this statement is not possible.
  C: RealProp owns the Garza Tower and Southco owns the Lynch Building, but since they are of different classes, this statement can never be true no matter how many trades are made.
  D: Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so this statement is not possible.
  E: RealProp owns the Garza Tower and Trustcorp does not own any building of class 1, so this statement is not possible.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building(class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Trades must be one-for-one building trades of the same class, one class 1 building for two class 2 building trades, and one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings trades. 
  RealProp owns only one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only one class 1 building.
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  
Analysis:
  A: RealProp doesn't own the Flores Tower, which is owned by Southco, so this statement cannot be true.
  B: Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, so this statement cannot be true.
  C: Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, so this statement cannot be true.
  D: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, and Ortiz Building is owned by Trustcorp, so this statement cannot be true.
  E: RealProp doesn't own the Meyer Building and Trustcorp doesn't own the Garza Tower, so this statement cannot be true
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns three buildings: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns two buildings: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns three buildings: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  The three real estate companies are considering trading buildings with one another, with each trade being one of the following three types: Trading one building for one other building of the same class, Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.

Analysis:
  A: RealProp cannot own the Flores Tower since it is owned by Southco and it is class 1, while the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and is also class 1. Therefore, A can't be true.
  B: Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2), so it is not possible for them to own the Meyer Building (class 2). Therefore, B can't be true.
  C: Southco owns Garza Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2), so it is not possible for them to own the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building at the same time. Therefore, C can't be true.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2), so it is not possible for them to own the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) at the same time. Therefore, D can't be true.
  E: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), so it is not possible for Trustcorp to own the Garza Tower. Also, Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building (class 2), so it is not possible for RealProp to own the Meyer Building. Therefore, E can't be true.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. RealProp has Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  2. Southco has Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  3. Trustcorp has the King Building (class 2), the Meyer Building (class 2), and the Ortiz Building (class 2).
  4. The trades allowed are (i) Trading one building for one other building of the same class, (ii) Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, and (iii) Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.

Solution: 
  Let's analyze each option:
  A: The Flores Tower is the only building owned by Southco that is a class 1 building, so if RealProp has the Flores Tower, then they must have traded their Garza Tower for it, which means that Southco must have given a class 1 building for a class 1 building, which is not allowed. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: This option is possible. If Southco trades Flores Tower (class 1) for Garza Tower (class 1), then they will have Garza Tower and Lynch Building, and if they trade Lynch Building (class 2) for Meyer Building (class 2), then they will own Flores Tower and Meyer Building.
  C: This option also cannot be true. If Southco owns Garza Tower, then they must have traded Flores Tower for it. Therefore, Flores Tower must be owned by RealProp, which means that Lynch Building must have been traded for Yates House or Zimmer House, but the trades only allow trading a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings OR trading a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. So, Southco cannot have Garza Tower and Lynch Building.
  D: This option is possible. If Trustcorp trades Ortiz Building (class 2) for Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3), then they will own Flores Tower, King Building, Meyer Building, and Yates House and Zimmerman House will be owned by RealProp.
  E: This option is also not possible. If Trustcorp owns Garza Tower, then they must have traded Ortiz Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings, which means that Zimmer House and Yates House must have been traded for it. Therefore, RealProp must own Flores Tower, which means that Southco must own Lynch Building, and Trustcorp must own King Building and Meyer Building (both class 2), but then they cannot trade any of their buildings for class 1 building, violating trade rules.
  Based on the above analysis, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Trade can only be of three types: 
    i. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    ii. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    iii. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  
A: RealProp cannot own Flores Tower, which is owned by Southco. So, this cannot be true.
B: It is possible for Southco to own Flores Tower and Meyer Building, as both are of different classes and can be traded as per the given conditions. 
C: It is not possible for Southco to own Garza Tower and Lynch Building. Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, and Lynch Building is owned by Southco. So, this cannot be true.
D: Trustcorp cannot own Flores Tower. Flores Tower is owned by Southco. So, this cannot be true.
E: It is not possible for Trustcorp to own Garza Tower and Meyer Building. Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, and Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp. So, this cannot be true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns three buildings: the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns two buildings: the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns three buildings: the King Building (class 2), the Meyer Building (class 2), and the Ortiz Building (class 2).
  There are three permissible types of trades, as stated in the context. 
  A, B, C, D, and E are statements about which buildings are owned by which company, but only one of them is not possible.
  
Analysis:
  A is not possible. RealProp does not own the Flores Tower. 
  B is possible according to the given information. 
  C is not possible. RealProp owns the Garza Tower and Southco owns the Lynch Building.
  D is not possible. The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, not Trustcorp. 
  E is not possible. Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  RealProp has one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  Trades can only be made between buildings of the same class or according to the specified rules (1-class-1-for-2-class-2, 1-class-2-for-2-class-3).
   
Analysis:
  A: RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) owned by Southco.
  B: Southco owns one class 1 and one class 2 building, so it cannot own the Meyer Building (class 2) and the Flores Tower (class 1) at the same time.
  C: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1). Southco owns the only other class 1 building, so if Southco owned the Garza Tower, then RealProp would own neither of its class 1 buildings, which is not possible as each company needs to own at least one building for trades to be made.
  D: Trustcorp only has three class 2 buildings, so it cannot own both the Flores Tower (class 1) and Ortiz Building (class 2) at the same time.
  E: The Garza Tower (class 1) owned by RealProp cannot be traded for the Meyer Building (class 2) and the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, so TrustCorp cannot own Garza Tower and Meyer Building at the same time.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). 
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). 
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. 
  The types of trades allowed are clearly specified. 
  
Analysis: 
  For the RealProp buildings to be the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower, RealProp would have to trade the Yates House for the Flores Tower and trade the Garza Tower for the Yates House. This would violate the rule that class 1 building can be traded for only two class 2 buildings. Therefore, A is not possible. 
  For the Southco buildings to be the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building, Trustcorp must trade either the Ortiz Building or the Meyer Building for the Lynch Building (since the only type of trade that gets a class 1 building is trading one for two class 2 buildings). Then Trustcorp would have to trade the King Building for the Flores Tower and the third building of the trade must be the Lynch building, so Southco can get two buildings in the trade. Thus B is possible. 
  For the Southco buildings to be the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, RealProp would have to trade the Yates House for the Flores Tower, which means Southco must also get the Yates House as the part of the trade. But there is no way for RealProp to get two class 2 buildings in return for a class 1 building. Thus C is not possible. 
  For the Trustcorp buildings to be the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building, Southco would need to trade the Lynch Building for the Flores Tower and the third building of the trade must be the Ortiz building. There would be only one building left, which would mean Trustcorp could trade only one building for two buildings in a trade, which is not allowed in the problem. Thus D is not possible.
  For the Trustcorp buildings to be the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building, RealProp would have to trade the Yates House for the Flores Tower, which means Trustcorp would have to get two class 2 buildings for a class 1 building in some trade. However, Trustcorp does not have two class 3 buildings to trade for a class 2 building. Thus E is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are 5 witnesses and exactly 3 days for the hearing: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.

Analysis:
* If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then neither of them can testify on Tuesday, because there are exactly two witnesses testifying on Tuesday.
* If Hong does not testify on Monday, and at least one other person testifies on Monday, then Franco would have to testify on Monday. So B, C, D & E are eliminated.
* Thus A is the only choice left.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The hearing takes place Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
- Each witness testifies on exactly one day.
- Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.
- If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then neither can testify on Monday. 

Analysis:
- Since Hong does not testify on Monday and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco must also not testify on Monday. Thus, we know that at least one of Garcia and Franco will testify on Monday.
- We know that Iturbe will testify on Wednesday, so the remaining two witnesses, Garcia and Jackson, will testify on Tuesday.
- If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then neither Garcia nor Franco can testify on Monday. Therefore, we have only one witness (out of Garcia and Franco) to schedule for Monday and at least two witnesses to schedule for Tuesday.
- Hence, the only valid schedule we can have is Iturbe on Wednesday, Hong and Franco on Tuesday and Garcia and Jackson on Monday. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The schedule has to be for exactly three days of one week - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then neither of them can testify on Monday, because Hong does not testify on Monday.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco and Hong must testify on Monday and Tuesday but not on Wednesday.
  This leaves Garcia and Jackson, who have to testify on Tuesday, and Garcia cannot testify on Monday, so he must testify on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson
  - The hearing takes 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
  - Each witness testifies on 1 day only
  - Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday
  - Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday
  - Hong does not testify on Monday
  - At least 1 witness testifies on Monday

If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco and Hong must be scheduled on Tuesday, and Garcia must be scheduled on Monday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson. 
  The hearing will take place on exactly three days of one week: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, that means Franco cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Thus, Franco and Hong must testify on either Tuesday or Wednesday. But we know Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, therefore Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday.
 
Analysis:
  Franco and Hong testify on Tuesday.
  Garcia cannot testify on Monday since Franco does not testify with Garcia and there must be at least one witness on Monday. Therefore, Garcia can only testify on Wednesday.
  Iturbe must testify on Wednesday.
  There are already three witnesses, Franco, Hong, and Garcia, slated to testify on Tuesday and Wednesday. So both Jackson and another witness must testify on Monday. Since there are no other restrictions on the scheduling, there could be any number of valid schedules that meet these conditions.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Five witnesses (Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson) will testify.
  - The hearing is three days long, and each witness testifies exactly once on one of the days (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday).
  - Constraints:
    - Franco doesn't testify on the same day as Garcia.
    - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
    - Two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
    - Hong doesn't testify on Monday.
    - At least one witness testifies on Monday.

We know that Franco and Hong cannot testify on the same day. Therefore, Franco cannot testify on Monday because we know that at least one witness must testify on that day. If Franco cannot testify on Monday, and Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, then Franco must testify on Tuesday. This means that Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday with one of the other witnesses, and since Hong cannot testify on Monday, Garcia must testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The hearing takes exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Two witnesses must testify on Tuesday.
  Hong will not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday. This means that one of the remaining witnesses (Garcia, Iturbe, or Jackson) must testify on Monday, and Hong must testify on either Monday or Wednesday. Since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, Hong must testify on Monday. This means that Garcia and Jackson must testify on Tuesday. Therefore, the only valid schedule is: 
  Monday: Hong and Garcia or Jackson 
  Tuesday: Garcia or Jackson and one other witness
  Wednesday: Iturbe and Franco 
  Answer: Answer(B) Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 5 witnesses: F, G, H, I, J.
  - The schedule is for 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
  - Each witness will testify on exactly one day.
  - Franco and Garcia don't testify on the same day.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong doesn't testify on Monday.
  - At least 1 witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong:
  - Franco and Hong can only testify on Tuesday together.
  - That means Garcia cannot be on Tuesday because then Franco and Garcia would be together.
  - So Garcia is either on Monday or Wednesday.
  - Iturbe will be on Wednesday.
  - That leaves Jackson for Monday.
  
  A: Franco must testify on Tuesday with Hong, so this isn't necessarily true.
  B: Garcia could be scheduled for Monday, but it could also be Wednesday.
  C: Garcia could be scheduled for Wednesday, but it could also be Monday.
  D: This is true since Hong can only be scheduled for Tuesday (with Franco).
  E: Iturbe is confirmed to be scheduled for Wednesday, but there will be other witnesses too.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
The schedule must meet the following conditions: 
- Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.

A: In the case where Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, the schedule cannot have Franco on Wednesday since Iturbe has to testify on that day.
B: Garcia and Franco cannot testify on the same day. Hence, this cannot be true.
C: If Garcia testifies on Wednesday, divided into two cases:
   1. If Franco testifies on Monday, then Jackson will also have to testify on Monday, leaving only Iturbe and Hong for Tuesday.
         But since Iturbe has to testify on Wednesday, Hong has to testify on Tuesday. 
   2. If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then only Garcia and Iturbe can testify on Wednesday. However, the condition of each day having exactly one witness testifying will be violated because more than one witness will testify on Wednesday. Therefore, this case is not possible.
D: If Hong testifies on Tuesday, then Jackson will have to testify on Monday as only Franco and Garcia are left. This will leave Iturbe to testify on Wednesday. Therefore, this option can be true.
E: This cannot be true because Franco or Hong has to testify on Monday.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  - Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong does not testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then there are only two possible days on which they could testify together: Tuesday or Wednesday.

Analysis:
  - If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Hong must testify on Wednesday as well, but this would violate the constraint that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  - Garcia cannot testify on Monday because Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  - If Garcia testifies on Wednesday, this would satisfy the constraint that Franco and Hong would not testify together, so this choice is possible.
  - If Hong testifies on Tuesday, then only one witness would remain to testify on Wednesday (Iturbe), which would violate the constraint that at least one witness testifies on Monday. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  - Iturbe is already specified to testify on Wednesday, so this choice is incorrect.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the auditions, from first to last?
Choices:
  A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida
  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
  C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida
  D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
  E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Six singers are being auditioned: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  2. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be recorded.
  3. The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  4. The fifth audition must be recorded.
  5. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  6. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  7. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Solution:
  From condition 5, we know that Waite will be auditioned before Kammer and Lugo.
  From condition 6, we know that Kammer will be auditioned before Trillo.
  From condition 7, we know that Zinn will be auditioned before Yoshida.
  From condition 3, we know that the fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  From condition 4, we know that the fifth audition must be recorded.
  Hence, the first audition could only be for Waite, Kammer, or Zinn.
  
  Considering all the above conditions, we can deduce the following order:
    Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
    
  Therefore, Answer("D") is correct.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded, while the other four will not be.
  - The fourth audition can only be non-recorded, as the fifth must be recorded.
  - Waite's audition must be before the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place before Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must happen before Yoshida's audition.

Elimination:
  A: Kammer's audition must take place before Trillo's audition -- Kammer's audition is not first, so this cannot be right.
  B: Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions -- The order doesn't respect the rule that Lugo's audition will be recorded.
  C: All conditions are met. Trillo is just before Zinn, so it is met, but slightly violates the order in the question stem "from first to last". 
  D: All conditions are met but first and last order violates the order in the question stem "from first to last".
  E: Zinn cannot be first, as Yoshida's audition must come after Zinn's audition. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded. So, the fourth one must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  The fifth audition must be recorded. So, the fifth one must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. So, Waite's audition must be the first or the second one.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. So, Kammer's audition must be first or second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. So, Zinn's audition must be either the third or the fourth one.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation:  
  - Waite must be first or second. Let's assume it's the first one.
    Waite - - - - -
  - Kammer must be before Trillo. The only possible choices are Kammer = 2 and Trillo = 3, or Kammer = 1 and Trillo = 2.
    Waite Kammer Trillo - - -
    or
    Waite Kammer - Trillo - -
  - The fourth audition can not be recorded. So, we use the order with Kammer at 2.
    Waite Kammer Lugo Trillo Zinn Yoshida
  - The fifth audition must be recorded. So, it must be Kammer/Lugo.
  - Zinn's audition must be before Yoshida's. So, they must be the 5th and 6th auditions, respectively.
    Waite Kammer Lugo Zinn Yoshida Trillo. 
  - The correct answer is the order of the auditions from first to last: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo. So, the answer is (B).
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded, while the other four will not.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Elimination:
  In option A, Kammer's audition is before Trillo's, but in this option Trillo is before Kammer, so A is not correct.
  In option B, Waite goes first as required, and Kammer is before Trillo as required. Also Zinn is before Lugo which completes all requirements. Therefore, B is correct.
  In option C, Kammer and Lugo's positions are swapped with respect to the actual positions. Therefore, C is not correct.
  In option D, Zinn goes before Kammer as required, however, the order of Waite and Zinn is swapped, so D is not correct.
  In option E, Kammer is after Trillo which conflicts with the actual order. Therefore, E is not correct.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. 
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. 
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Checking the orders:
* In A, the fifth is not recorded - incorrect
* In B, the order that Waite's audition takes place after Kammer's audition - incorrect
* In C, the order of Kammer's audition taking place before Trillo's audition is correct. Yoshida's audition taking place last is incorrect.
* In D, the order that the fourth audition, which cannot be recorded, taking place after Zinn's audition is incorrect.
* In E, the order satisfies all the conditions mentioned.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  2. The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded.
  3. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  4. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  5. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Elimination:
  We know Waite's audition must come before the two recorded auditions, who are Kammer and Lugo. 
  Therefore, Waite's audition must be either first or second. We can eliminate answer choices A and C because     they do not have Waite first or second.
  Answer E cannot be correct because it has both Zinn and Yoshida recording their auditions, which breaks condition 1.

Analysis:
  According to condition 4, Kammer's audition must come before Trillo's audition. Combined with condition 2, we know that Trillo must be fourth and Lugo must be sixth because her audition must be recorded. This means that Kammer's audition must be either first or second. If Kammer's audition is first, then Waite's audition must be second and Zinn's audition must be third (because of condition 5). This leaves Yoshida's audition to take the fifth slot, which is allowed. This leaves us with only one possible order: Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Trillo, Yoshida, Lugo. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
- The fifth audition must be recorded.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. 
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. 
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Explanation:
- Using the given conditions, we can deduce the following facts:
  - The 4th audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the four unrecorded auditions.
  - The 5th audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer or Lugo's audition.
  - Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded ones, so Waite should be one of the first three auditions.
  - Since Kammer's audition must be before Trillo's, they could not possibly be the 5th and 6th audition, respectively.
  - Zinn's audition will take place before Yoshida's, so Zinn should be first or second in the order.

Using the above facts, we can eliminate answer choices A, C, and E. 

- Answer Choice B
  - Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo:
    - Waite's audition comes first, followed by Kammer's
    - Kammer's audition should be followed by an audition that will not be recorded=> Yoshida's audition is ruled out from this position 
    - As per the conditions, Zinn's audition must take place before Yoshida's audition. Thus, Zinn's audition should be in the third position.
    - The fifth audition must be recorded, so it should either be Kammer's or Lugo's audition. We already know that Kammer and Waite have been auditioned. Therefore Lugo should be auditioned followed by Trillo.
  - The order is possible and satisfies all the given conditions.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- There are six singers to be auditioned: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
- Kammer and Lugo's audition will be recorded, while the other four will not be recorded.
- Fourth audition cannot be recorded.
- Fifth audition must be recorded.
- Waite must audition earlier than the two recorded auditions.
- Kammer must audition before Trillo.
- Zinn must audition before Yoshida.

Logic: 
- We know that the fifth audition must be recorded and the fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, we can exclude answer choices that violate this condition.
- We also know that Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions. Therefore, we can exclude answer choices that violate this condition.
- From the remaining answer choices, we need to ensure that Kammer's audition takes place before Trillo's and Zinn's audition takes place before Yoshida's.

Answer: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
- Waite must audition earlier than Kammer's and Lugo's auditions.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
- Given these conditions, the only ordering that meets all of the requirements is: 
  Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida. 
  Therefore, the answer is (D).
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Six singers are to audition one after the other on a single day.
- Kammer's and Lugo's auditions will be recorded; the other 4 will not be.
- The fourth audition (Trillo's) cannot be recorded.
- The fifth audition must be recorded (Yoshida's).
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions (Kammer's and Lugo's).
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analysis:
- Based on the conditions, it can be determined that Trillo's audition will be the fourth, Yoshida's audition will be the fifth, and Kammer's and Lugo's auditions will be either first or second and not necessarily in that order.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than Kammer's and Lugo's auditions, so it can be either first, second, or third.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. This means that Zinn's audition must be first, second, or third. 

Options Analysis: 
A:  Kammer second, Trillo third, Zinn first or second, Waite fourth, the other two (Lugo and Yoshida) in any order to complete the six auditions.
B:  Waite first, Kammer second, Yoshida fifth, Zinn fourth or sixth, Lugo sixth or fourth and Trillo third or sixth.
C:  Waite first, Lugo second, Kammer third, Trillo fourth, Zinn fifth, and Yoshida sixth.
D:  Waite first, Zinn second, Kammer third, Trillo fourth, Lugo fifth, and Yoshida sixth.
E:  Zinn first, Yoshida second, Waite third, Lugo fourth, Kammer fifth, and Trillo sixth.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - One of the recorded auditions must be Kammer's audition and the other must be Lugo's audition.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded and the fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, which means that Waite's audition must be first or second.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, which means that Kammer's audition must be first, second, or third.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Elimination:
  - Option A has Kammer's audition after Trillo's audition, which violates one of the conditions.
  - Option B has Yoshida's audition before Zinn's audition, which violates one of the conditions.
  - Option C has Lugo's audition before Waite's audition, which violates one of the conditions.
  - Option D satisfies all the conditions but has Zinn's audition before Waite's audition, which is not in the correct order.
  - Option E satisfies all the conditions and has the correct order.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A corporate manager is selecting employees for a research team. The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. The selection is constrained by the following conditions: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team?
Choices:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt
  B: Ortega and Wong
  C: Paine and Schmidt
  D: Thomson and Yoder
  E: Yoder and Zayre
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The question refers to a constraint satisfaction problem.
  The problem involves selecting employees for a research team, but the selection is constrained by several conditions.
  One of the conditions is that if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Another condition is that if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. A third condition is that if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  We are asked to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, at least one of Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team. This means that Ortega cannot be on the team, since if Myers is on the team, Ortega cannot be. Thus, we are left with Wong, Myers, Yoder, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, and Zayre. 

  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. This means that we cannot have Schmidt, Paine, or Thomson without the other two. 

  The only remaining option is Wong, and we know that both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team if Wong is on the team. Therefore, the pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Ortega and Wong (answer B).
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The team will include at least four employees from a group of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  - If Myers is on the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

Analysis:
  - Ortega and Wong cannot both be on the team, due to the condition on Wong.
  - Paine and Thomson cannot be the required pair, because they both depend on Schmidt's membership.
  - Yoder and Zayre can be ignored, because the question says "at least one," and neither of them is required to be on the team.
  - That leaves Ortega and Schmidt as the only pair not already ruled out.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

To ensure that at least one employee from a particular pair is on the team, we need to identify pairs where:
- at least one employee cannot be on the team together due to a constraint
- the remaining employees in the pair do not exclude each other from being on the team (i.e. they could both possibly be on the team together, regardless of any other constraints).

Let's consider the pairs:
- Ortega and Schmidt: Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is on it. Schmidt can only be on the team if Paine and Thomson are both also on it. Thus, there is no way both Ortega and Schmidt can be on the team, so this pair does not meet the conditions for the question.
- Ortega and Wong: Wong can only be on the team if Myers and Yoder are both also on it. Thus, at least one employee from the Ortega-Wong pair must be on the team, since either Myers or Yoder will be on the team if Wong is selected.
- Paine and Schmidt: Schmidt can only be on the team if Paine and Thomson are both also on it. There is no constraint preventing Paine from being on the team, so Paine and Schmidt could both be on the team together. Thus, at least one employee from the Paine-Schmidt pair must be on the team.
- Thomson and Yoder: There is no constraint preventing Thomson and Yoder from both being on the team. Thus, at least one employee from the Thomson-Yoder pair must be on the team.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The research team will include at least four employees out of the given eight employees.
  - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  - If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  - If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
- If Ortega is selected, Myers and Wong cannot be selected. However, at least one of Myers or Wong must be on the team, so Ortega cannot be on the team.
- If Paine is selected, Myers cannot be selected. However, either Myers or Wong must be on the team, so Paine cannot be on the team.
- If Thomson is selected, Paine must also be selected. So, at least Myers/Yoder has to be there, but if Myers is not there then Ortega and Paine both cannot be there. Hence, Thomson cannot be on the team.
- If Yoder is selected, Myers has to be selected. Hence, either Ortega or Paine has to be on the team (as only 3 are there on the team - Myers, Yoder and Wong) and Thomson will be automatically be selected. 
- If Zayre is selected, there is no information available about his/her constraints. So, we cannot determine whether Zayre will be on the team or not.
- Therefore, the only pair of employees that meets the criteria is Ortega and Wong, because if Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team, so at least one of them will be on the team.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 employees to choose from for the research team: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  - If Myers is chosen, Ortega and Paine cannot also be chosen.
  - If Schmidt is chosen, both Paine and Thomson must be chosen.
  - If Wong is chosen, both Myers and Yoder must also be chosen.

Possible solutions:
  - Ortega cannot be chosen if Myers is on the team.
  - If Schmidt is not on the team, Paine and Thomson cannot be on the team.
  - If Wong is not on the team, Myers and Yoder cannot be on the team.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team. Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must be on the team together if Schmidt is on the team. Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be together on the team if Wong is on the team. Therefore, the only option for a pair that must have at least one member on the team is Ortega and Wong.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The selection constraints are given as follows:
    * If Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine are.
    * If Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson are.
    * If Wong is selected, both Myers and Yoder are.
  The team must include at least four employees from the list of eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
  To answer this question, it is necessary to determine if there are any pairs of employees that must both be on the team according to the constraints.
  
Analysis:
  According to the given constraints:
    * If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  This means that if Wong is selected, then either Myers or Yoder, or both, must be on the team.
  None of the other constraints provide this level of restriction.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  According to the given constraints:
    * If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  This means that if Wong is selected, then either Myers or Yoder, or both, must be on the team. Therefore, Wong and Ortega are not the required pair. Similarly, Schmidt and Paine cannot be the required pair because there is no constraint that requires both of them to be on the team. Thomson and Yoder are also not a required pair, as there is no constraint that requires both of them to be on the team. Zayre is not specifically linked to any other employee in the constraints. Therefore, the only possible pair of employees who must both be on the team is Ortega and Wong. Answer("B").
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The team will include at least four employees from a total of eight.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be.
  
Analysis:
  If Myers is not on the team, Ortega and/or Paine could be, but the question requires at least one of the team members to be in a pair. The same applies to Schmidt and Wong; if they are not on the team, their groups could be left out entirely.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The research team needs at least four members from eight potential candidates (Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre).
  If Myers is on the team, Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  
Analysis:
  To determine which pair of employees must be on the team, the following employees must be considered:
    - Myers
    - Ortega
    - Paine
    - Schmidt
    - Thomson
    - Wong
    - Yoder
    - Zayre
  From the constraints, the following can be determined:
    - If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, Myers must be excluded from the pair.
    - If Schmidt is on the team, Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must be included in the pair.
    - If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Wong and Yoder must be included
  Based on the analysis, the only pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Thomson and Yoder.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Therefore, it is guaranteed that either Paine or Schmidt must be in the team. Since we need to find a pair, we can select Paine and Schmidt. And this is the only pair of employees in the answer choices where at least one person is guaranteed to be on the team. 
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The team must have at least four employees from the given eight. 
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.

To find the pair of employees who must be on the team, we can use the contrapositive of each given statement. For example, if Ortega is not on the team, then Myers and Schmidt cannot both be on the team.

Action: Answer("B")  
Using the contrapositives of the given statements, we can see that if neither Myers nor Yoder is on the team, then Wong cannot be on the team. Therefore, at least one of Myers or Yoder must be on the team if Wong is on the team. The only option that includes Wong and one of Myers or Yoder is B, Ortega and Wong. Therefore, answer is B.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.

Elimination:
  Choices A, B, and E can be eliminated because they would violate the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Choice C can be eliminated because it would violate the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Six employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young) need to be assigned one of the six parking space numbers.
  Robertson needs to be assigned a parking space from number #1 to #4.
  Young needs a parking space with a higher number than Togowa.
  Xu needs a parking space with a higher number than Souza.
  Robertson needs a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  
A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  If Robertson is assigned to parking space #4, this means that Young should be assigned to space #5. However, in this scenario, Xu would have to be assigned to parking space #6, which is a violation of the rule that Robertson needs a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this assignment is not valid.
  
B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  If Robertson is assigned to parking space #5, this would mean that Young would need to be assigned parking space #6. But in this scenario, Xu would need to be assigned parking space #3, which is a violation of the rule that Xu needs to be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, this assignment is not valid.
  
C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  If Robertson is assigned to parking space #4, this would mean that Young is assigned parking space #5 and Togowa is assigned parking space #1 or #2; but in both cases, Xu would have to be assigned to parking space #6, which is a violation of the rule that Robertson needs a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this assignment is not valid.

D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  If Robertson is assigned to parking space #2 or #3, then Xu would have to be assigned to parking space #6 which is a violation of the rule that Robertson needs a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned to parking space #1. By following the other rules, the scenario in choice D is valid.

E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
  If Robertson is assigned to parking space #4, this would mean that Young is assigned parking space #5 and Togowa is assigned parking space #2, and Xu should be assigned parking space #6, which is a violation of the rule that Robertson needs a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this assignment is not valid.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The possible assignments of parking spaces must follow these rules:
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  We know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. So, options A, B and E, which each have Robertson assigned to a higher-numbered parking space, are not possible.
  In option C, Togowa is assigned parking space #1, so Young must be assigned parking space #2 which is lower than Togowa's, which contradicts the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Hence, option C is not possible.
  In option D, all the rules are satisfied: Robertson is assigned parking space #1, Togowa is assigned the lowest possible parking space (#1), Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  There are six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  The rules of assignment are:
    - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    
Analysis:
  Robertson must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4
  From the fourth rule, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Three possible outcomes for Robertson and Young are: Robertson #3 and Young #4; Robertson #2 and Young #3; Robertson #1 and Young #2
  From the first rule, Young must have a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore Young must occupy #3 or #4, and Togowa #1 or #2.
  From the second rule, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore Xu must occupy #5 or #6, and Souza #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Finally, using the fourth rule, there are three possible assignments of the numbers 1 to 4: #1-#2-#3-#4, #2-#3-#4-#1, and #3-#4-#1-#2.
  
  A: It is not possible because Togowa is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  B: It is not possible because Robertson is not assigned to parking spaces #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  C: It is possible: #1:Togowa, #2:Young, #3:Xu, #4:Robertson, #5:Souza, #6:Vaughn
  D: It is possible: #1:Togowa, #2:Robertson, #3:Young, #4:Souza, #5:Vaughn, #6:Xu
  E: It is not possible because Xu is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Souza.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Analysis:
  From the last rule, we know that Robertson cannot be assigned spaces 5 and 6. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned either spaces 1, 2, 3 or 4. From the third rule, we know that Robertson must be assigned a space higher than Young's. From the first rule, we know that Young must be assigned a space higher than Togowa's. Therefore, Young must be assigned space 6 and Togowa must be assigned space 5. From the second rule, we know that Xu must be assigned a space higher than Souza. So, Xu must be assigned space 4 and Souza must be assigned space 3. Vaughn must be assigned space 2. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young 
  Six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6 
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. 
  Young > Togowa
  Xu > Souza
  Robertson > Young
  Robertson < Parking Space #5
Analysis:
  Based on the rules, Robertson must occupy Parking Space 1, 2, 3, or 4 and must have a higher number than Young. Out of these options, (A) can't be possible since Young is assigned to a lower parking space than Togowa. In (B), Robertson will be assigned to higher parking space than Young, but Xu will again not fulfill the requirement of having a higher parking space than Souza. Similarly, in (C), Xu will have to occupy a higher numbered parking space than Souza, which does not hold. Last option (E) does not fulfill the requirement of having Robertson in Parking Space 1, 2, 3, or 4 and also violates the allocated parking spaces of Togowa and Xu. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Six employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young) should be assigned one of the six parking spaces.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Robertson must be assigned to parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
  Young's parking space number must be greater than Togowa's and less than Robertson's.
  Xu's parking space number must be greater than Souza's.

Let's try the options:
  
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
     Robertson must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. In this case, Togowa has #5 and Young has #1, which is a contradiction of the rules.
     
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
     Robertson must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. In this case, all rules are satisfied; keep for now.
     
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
     Robertson must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. In this case, Xu has #3 and Souza has #5, which violates one of the rules.
     
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
     Robertson must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. In this case, all rules are satisfied; keep for now.
     
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
     Robertson must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. In this case, Xu has #5, and Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
 
 Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six new employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young).
  - There are six parking spaces (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6).
  - Each employee must be assigned a unique parking space.
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  
Analysis: 
  - The first condition ensures that Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - The fourth condition ensures that Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, the possible parking space assignments for Robertson are #2, #3, and #4.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, which means the possible parking space assignments for Young are #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This means Xu can only be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  
Action: Answer("D") 

  Explanation: 
    Based on the analysis above and the given conditions, the only parking space assignment that meets all of the conditions is D:
    #1: Togowa
    #2: Robertson
    #3: Young
    #4: Souza
    #5: Vaughn
    #6: Xu
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 6 employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - Each employee is assigned one of the six parking spaces, but no two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - There are some restrictions on the parking spaces assigned to certain employees:
    - Young must have a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    - Xu must have a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    - Robertson must have a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    
  A: Young (#1), Souza (#2), Vaughn (#3), Robertson (#4), Togowa (#5), Xu (#6)
     This assignment violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, it cannot be correct.
  B: Vaughn (#1), Togowa (#2), Young (#3), Souza (#4), Robertson (#5), Xu (#6)
     This assignment satisfies all the conditions, so it could be correct.
  C: Togowa (#1), Young (#2), Xu (#3), Robertson (#4), Souza (#5), Vaughn (#6)
     This assignment violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, it cannot be correct.
  D: Togowa (#1), Robertson (#2), Young (#3), Souza (#4), Vaughn (#5), Xu (#6)
     This assignment satisfies all the conditions, except the condition that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, it cannot be correct.
  E: Souza (#1), Togowa (#2), Young (#3), Robertson (#4), Xu (#5), Vaughn (#6)
     This assignment violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, it cannot be correct.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Six students are available for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  - Each of the four years (1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924) will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  - If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project: 
    - Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
    - If Ryan is assigned to the project, Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  
Solution: 
We know that Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project. Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1921. If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. But Onyx is already assigned to 1921, so Mollie must be assigned to 1922. Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Tiffany cannot be assigned because Ryan is already assigned to the project. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1923. That leaves Yoshio, who must be assigned to 1924.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  2. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  3. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  4. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then:
  From 4, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  From 3, if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. But we already know that Ryan is assigned to the project; therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  From 1, Tiffany has to be assigned to 1923; therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923. 
  From 2, if Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  There are only two years available for Mollie: 1921 and 1922. Since Mollie was not assigned to either of the two years, this means that Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.
  Therefore, Louis and Yoshio are available for the two remaining years which are 1921 and 1922.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project: 
  If Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's assignment. 
  In any case, there is only one student per year. 
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.

Analysis:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then: 
    - Ryan cannot be assigned to 1924, because no student can be assigned to the year immediately following Ryan's. Therefore, the only choice left for Ryan is 1923.
    - Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922, because Mollie must be assigned to one of those years if she is included in the project, and only one student per year is allowed. Therefore, Yoshio must be assigned to 1924.
  This leaves Louis, Mollie, Onyx, and Tiffany to be assigned to 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.

Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, the statement 'Onyx is assigned to 1922' could be true.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.

Analysis:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned, then either Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan also must be assigned, but since there can be only one person assigned to each year, then it is impossible for Mollie to not be assigned yet to either 1921 or 1922. This contradicts the condition "If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922."
  Then, Tiffany must not be assigned to the project, which means that Ryan is not assigned either since "If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project."
  The condition for Onyx then doesn't matter.
  Yoshio can be assigned to any year that is still unassigned.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, and if Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, then Yoshio must be assigned to the year immediately after Ryan's.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, both Tiffany and Ryan cannot be assigned to the project at the same time.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
Actions: 
- Eliminate choices A, B, and D because they include Tiffany or Louis, who can only be assigned to 1923 if the other is not.
- Eliminate choice C because Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
Context:
  Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  If Ryan is assigned to 1923, it violates the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
  If Yoshio is assigned to 1923, a contradiction arises when trying to assign Louis or Tiffany to a year.
  If Yoshio and Ryan are assigned to 1923 and 1924, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922 to match the condition that "Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's".
  Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 because if she is assigned, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923 and that violates "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923."
  Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1921 because if he is assigned, then Mollie cannot be assigned to the project. 
  Yoshio can be assigned to 1922. This leaves Louis, Tiffany, and Mollie to be assigned to 1921, 1923, and 1924. Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923 because Yoshio is already assigned there. Then only Louis can be assigned to 1923. This leaves Mollie to be assigned to 1921 and Tiffany to be assigned to 1924. Thus, only Onyx can be assigned to 1922. Therefore, Onyx is assigned to 1922 is a possible outcome.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, we know that none of them can be assigned to 1924 which has only one student assigned. We also know that if Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, Ryan must also be assigned, while if Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
A: If Louis is assigned to 1923 and Tiffany cannot be assigned to the same year, then this scenario is impossible.
B: If Mollie is assigned to 1921 and Yoshio is assigned to 1922, this scenario satisfies the given conditions.
C: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, meaning that Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1922, and this scenario is impossible.
D: If Tiffany is assigned to 1924, and Louis, Mollie, Ryan, and Yoshio are assigned to the other years, this scenario is impossible because only one student can be assigned to 1924.
E: If Yoshio is assigned to 1922, and Mollie is assigned to 1921, and Ryan and Onyx are assigned to 1924 and 1923 in some order, then this scenario satisfies the given conditions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany must be excluded from being assigned to the project to satisfy the conditions.
  A: Louis cannot be assigned to the project if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned. This choice is not possible.
  B: Mollie cannot be assigned to the project if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned. This choice is not possible.
  C: Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. If Ryan is assigned to 1924, then Onyx can be assigned to 1923. Otherwise, if Ryan is assigned to 1922 or 1923, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the project. This choice is not always possible.
  D: Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project if Ryan and Yoshio are assigned. This choice is not possible.
  E: Yoshio can be assigned to 1922. This choice is possible. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922 if she is assigned.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project. 
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. So, Onyx must be assigned to 1922 and Ryan must be assigned to 1923. 
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project because Ryan is already assigned to the project. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. But neither 1921 nor 1924 is available because Ryan is already assigned to 1923 and Onyx is assigned to 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, the only option that could be true is Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then there could be at most one student to each year for the project, as there are four years and six students available for the project.
  
Analysis:
  We know that at most one student can be assigned to each year, which leaves two years without a student assigned to them. Tiffany and Ryan cannot fill them because they have to be assigned to specific years. Mollie, Louis, and Onyx cannot be assigned to 1923 and Yoshio cannot be assigned to either 1921 or 1924 because he has to share the project with Ryan. Therefore, Yoshio has to be assigned to one of the two remaining years, which are 1921 and 1922. This means that Mollie has to be assigned to the other year between 1921 and 1922, so there are no available years for Louis and Onyx. Therefore, none of the choices can be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The chemistry class has six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  The class has six lab sessions, with one lab session held each morning and one each afternoon on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

Approach:
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we can use the given constraints to determine the schedule of some of the other lab assistants. We will consider the possible combinations to determine which sessions some of the lab assistants could lead.

We know that Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session. Therefore, we can place him in the schedule:

|        | Morning | Afternoon |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Wed    |         |           |
| Thu    |         | Julio     |
| Fri    |         |           |

We are told that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca can only be scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday, as their sessions cannot be on the same day as Julio's session. We can try to place them on Wednesday, or Thursday:

Case 1: Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on Wednesday

|        | Morning | Afternoon |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Wed    | Rebecca| Kevin    |
| Thu    |         | Julio     |
| Fri    |         |           |

In this case, only Lan, Nessa, and Olivia remain to be scheduled. However, we know that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. Therefore, Lan and Olivia must be scheduled for Thursday and Friday. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must be scheduled for either Thursday afternoon or Friday afternoon. Using these constraints, we can determine the schedule of all the lab assistants:

|        | Morning   | Afternoon |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Wed    | Rebecca  | Kevin    |
| Thu    | Lan       | Julio     |
| Fri    | Olivia   | Nessa    |

In this case, all the other lab assistants have a specific session they would lead. Therefore, we can determine the sessions for 5 of the 6 lab assistants.

Case 2: Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on Thursday

|        | Morning | Afternoon |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Wed    |         |           |
| Thu    |Rebecca  |Kevin     |
| Fri    |         |           |

In this case, only Lan, Nessa, and Olivia remain to be scheduled. However, we know that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. Therefore, Lan and Olivia must be scheduled for Wednesday and Friday. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must be scheduled for either Wednesday afternoon or Friday afternoon. Using these constraints, we can determine the schedule of all the lab assistants:

|        | Morning   | Afternoon |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Wed    | Olivia   | Nessa    |
| Thu    | Rebecca  | Kevin     |
| Fri    | Lan       |           |

In this case, all the other lab assistants have a specific session they would lead. Therefore, we can determine the sessions for 5 of the 6 lab assistants.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The lab sessions are scheduled over three days - Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  There are six lab assistants available - Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  Each session will be led by a different lab assistant.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then there are specific constraints that limit which lab assistant can lead other sessions.

  Let's analyze the possible cases -

  1. If Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on Thursday and Friday respectively, then from the constraints, we know that Olivia cannot lead a session on Friday. This means that Olivia must lead the Wednesday afternoon session. Then, Nessa must lead the Thursday morning session, Lan must lead the Friday morning session, and Julio must lead the Wednesday morning session. Therefore, we can determine all lab assistants' sessions except Kevin's.

  2. If Rebecca and Kevin lead sessions on Thursday and Friday respectively, then from the constraints, we know that Olivia cannot lead a session on Friday. This means that Olivia must lead the Wednesday afternoon session. Then, Nessa must lead the Thursday morning session, Lan must lead the Friday morning session, and Julio must lead the Wednesday morning session. Therefore, we can determine all lab assistants' sessions except Rebecca's.

  The answer is the same for the two cases: Action: Answer("B") - two.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  We have three lab sessions scheduled - Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday - one in the morning and one in the afternoon each day.
  There are six different lab assistants available - Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  The following constraints exist:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, there are only two possible assignments for Kevin and Rebecca - both of them have to be assigned to Wednesday sessions. We can then assign Lan to the Friday morning session and Olivia to the Friday afternoon session. Nessa must be assigned to the Thursday morning session and hence we get the following possible arrangements:
  Morning: Wednesday - Kevin, Thursday - Nessa, Friday - Lan
  Afternoon: Wednesday - Rebecca, Thursday - Julio, Friday - Olivia
  Morning: Wednesday - Rebecca, Thursday - Nessa, Friday - Lan
  Afternoon: Wednesday - Kevin, Thursday - Julio, Friday - Olivia

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are a total of 6 lab sessions: 3 in the morning, and 3 in the afternoon, with one session per day in each of the 3 days (Wednesday, Thursday and Friday).
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

Action: 
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then: 
  - Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session because her session is later in the week than Julio's.
  - Therefore, the only lab assistants that can still lead the Thursday afternoon session are Kevin, Lan, Nessa, and Rebecca.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so if they lead the Thursday afternoon session, then one can determine which sessions they lead:
    *If they lead Thursday, then one can also determine that Olivia and Lan lead Friday, and Nessa leads Wednesday.
    *If they lead Friday, then one can also determine that Olivia and Lan lead Wednesday, and Nessa leads Thursday.
  - If Kevin and Rebecca do not lead the Thursday afternoon session, then it is still possible that any of the other three lab assistants (Lan, Nessa, or Olivia) lead the Thursday afternoon session and for one can determine which sessions they lead.
Therefore, in any case, one can determine which sessions exactly 2 of the other lab assistants lead. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six lab assistants - Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  2. There are six lab sessions - Wed(am), Wed(pm), Thu(am), Thu(pm), Fri(am), and Fri(pm).
  3. Kevin and Rebecca are together on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia are not together on the same day.
  5. Nessa leads an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session is on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's if Julio leads before Olivia.

Action: 
Since Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, immediately we can determine that:
  * Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's -> So, Olivia leads a session on Friday.
  * Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day -> So, Lan leads a session on Wednesday, and Olivia's other session is on Thursday morning.
  * Nessa must lead an afternoon session -> So, Nessa leads a session on Friday afternoon.
  
Now, we have these assignments: 
  - Julio leads Thursday afternoon.
  - Kevin and Rebecca are together, so they lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  
We have two possibilities for Kevin and Rebecca:
   1. Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on Wednesday. Then, Lan must lead a session on Thursday, and Nessa on Friday morning.
   2. Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on Friday. Then, Lan must lead a session on Wednesday, and Nessa on Thursday morning.
   
So, we know for sure the assignments of Lan, Nessa, and Olivia, and we have two possibilities for Kevin and Rebecca. Therefore: Answer("B") - two.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The lab assistants in the study are Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  The study focuses on six lab sessions, each one held at a different time on one of three days—Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. Each session must be led by a different lab assistant.
  Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions held on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions held on the same day.
  Nessa leads an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must be held on an earlier day of the week relative to Olivia's session.
  
Reasoning:
  According to the question, if Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, we need to determine how many of the other lab assistants we can reliably assign to a session. We know that since Julio must lead the Thursday afternoon session, Olivia cannot lead that session. We also know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so that implies that Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions held on the same day, which leaves them with Wednesday or Thursday, and we know that for Julio's session to happen earlier in the week than Olivia's, Julio's session must take place on Wednesday. We also know that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that are held on the same day. So, we can conclude that Lan must lead the Thursday morning session and Rebecca and Kevin must lead the Wednesday morning and afternoon sessions, respectively. This leaves just one lab assistant unassigned—Nessa, who we know must lead the Friday afternoon session, according to the given constraints. Therefore, the answer is Choice (A) one.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
- Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
- If Julio's session is on Thursday, then Olivia's session is on Friday
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session.

Analysis:
- If Rebecca leads a Thursday session, then Kevin leads the same morning session, and Lan and Olivia each lead one of the remaining morning sessions. Nessa must then lead both of the afternoon sessions on Friday, and Julio must lead the remaining morning session on Friday. Thus, the only unclear lab assistant in this case is Nessa. 
- If Rebecca and Kevin lead the Friday sessions, then Lan and Olivia must lead the morning sessions on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Nessa must lead both Thursday and Friday afternoon sessions. Finally, Julio leads the Wednesday morning session. In this case, the only unclear assistant is Nessa.
- Thus, in both cases, only Nessa's session assignment is unclear, for a total of one unclear assistant.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  2. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and thus, if we place Kevin/Rebecca on Friday (for instance), all present constraints satisfied. 
  3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same, implying that they must be in Wednesday and Thursday groups, in some order.
  4. Nessa can only lead an afternoon session.
  5. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

We can start with listing the possible arrangements that satisfy all the given constraints.
Thursday Afternoon: Julio
Friday Morning: Kevin/Rebecca
Wednesday Morning: Lan/Olivia
Thursday Morning: The remaining chemist who is not assigned in the previous three sessions must lead one morning session and since the only individual left is Nessa, she must have this session.
Wednesday Afternoon: The remaining leader must be either Lan or Olivia and Rebecca/Kevin, who have been assigned in the morning, cannot lead the afternoon session. Thus, the remaining leader is the one who is not assigned to Wednesday morning, and this must be (by elimination) Olivia. Lan will lead Thursday morning.

Based on these arrangements, we can determine which sessions the remaining lab assistants lead:
  1. One can determine which session Nessa leads.
  2. The session led by Olivia can be determined.
  3. The session led by Lan can be determined.
  4. The session led by Julio was already known, but the other two sessions are unconstrained, as Kevin/Rebecca can lead either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning sessions.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. A total of 6 lab sessions, with each session being led by a different lab assistant.
  2. Sessions are held on 3 days- Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, with one session in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  4. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  6. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
Using this information, we can derive the following possibilities:
Wednesday morning can be taken by Olivia/Lan, Wednesday afternoon can be taken by Julio/Nessa, Thursday morning can be taken by Kevin, and Friday morning can be taken by Rebecca.

If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Kevin and Rebecca must both lead sessions either on Wednesday or on Friday, but it is unknown which. Also, Nessa will have to lead the Wednesday afternoon session, leaving Lan to lead the Friday afternoon session. Therefore, four lab assistants' assignments can be determined.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The chemistry class has 6 lab sessions scheduled over 3 days, with one session in the morning and one in the afternoon of each day.
  The lab assistants are Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, there are only two possible combinations for Kevin and Rebecca - either they both lead sessions on Wednesday or on Friday.
  
Working:
  As Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session cannot be on Friday and Olivia's cannot be on Wednesday.
  Thus, Julio's session will be on Wednesday or Thursday. 
  If it is on Wednesday, then Kevin and Rebecca must both lead sessions on Wednesday and Olivia cannot have her session on Wednesday, so Olivia's session must be on Friday. 
  Thus, Lan and Nessa will lead the remaining sessions on Thursday.
  Therefore, we can determine which sessions four other lab assistants (Kevin, Rebecca, Olivia, and Lan) lead, hence the answer is (D) four.

Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students.
  Each of the four students will display exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls of the exhibition room, with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  We must check the rules to see which option cannot be true. 
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil. This option can be true according to rules.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. This option can be true according to rules.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. This option can be true because it follows the rule that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position. This option can be true according to rules.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. This option cannot be true because no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo and Isaacs) will display two paintings each on four walls such that each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene’s watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz’s oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs’s oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Solution:
  Let’s check the options one by one:
  A: If Franz’s watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene’s oil, it would mean that Franz’s oil and Greene’s watercolor would be on the same wall. But this violates the rule that says no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this situation cannot be true.
  B: If Franz’s watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo’s oil, it would mean that Franz’s oil and Hidalgo’s watercolor would be on the same wall. But this violates the rule that says no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this situation cannot be true.
  C: This situation is possible because one of the conditions is that Greene’s watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz’s oil is displayed. This condition does not indicate that Greene’s oil cannot be displayed in an upper position on a different wall.
  D: This situation is possible as there are no conditions that prevent Hidalgo's watercolor from being displayed in a lower position on a wall.
  E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, it would mean that Isaacs's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor would be on the same wall. But this violates the rule that says no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this situation cannot be true.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Four art students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo and Isaacs; will each display 2 paintings each.
  Condition: Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  Condition: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Condition: No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Condition: No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Condition: Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Condition: Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of the wall 4.

Action: Answer("B") 

According to the given conditions, neither Hidalgo's oil nor Franz's oil can be displayed on the same wall as the other's watercolor. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position where Franz's oil is also displayed. So Hidalgo's oil can not be displayed on the same wall where Franz's watercolor is being displayed. Hence, Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor. 
So, Franz's watercolor can displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. Therefore, it is possible that Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. Thus, (B) is the answer as it is the only option that cannot be true according to the conditions given.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The exhibition room has four walls, and exactly two paintings will be displayed on each wall. One painting is displayed in the upper position and the other in the lower position.
  Each of the four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution: Let's check each option:
  A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed with Greene's oil, it must be on wall 4. This means Hidalgo's and Isaacs's second paintings must also be on wall 4. However, Isaacs's paintings can't be together with Franz's paintings, so this option is not possible.
  B: Franz's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil can be displayed on either wall 1 or 2. Therefore, this option is possible.
  C: According to the given conditions, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position on the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. So, this option cannot be true.
  D: This option is possible because there is no restriction given on the positions of the paintings except that one of the paintings of each student is displayed in the lower position and the other one is displayed in the upper position.
  E: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed with Isaacs's watercolor, they must be on wall 2 or 3. However, on wall 2 or 3, there will be two artists with two paintings each. This is against the given conditions. Thus, this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
- Four art students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs - displaying two paintings each - an oil and a watercolor - in an exhibition room.
- The exhibition room consists of four walls - 1, 2, 3, and 4 - where exactly two paintings will be displayed on each wall with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil. 
  This cannot happen because Franz's oils are shown on walls where either Greene's oil or Hidalgo's oil is shown in the upper position. Additionally, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, there cannot be any wall where Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil. 
B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  This scenario is possible, as Franz's oils are shown on walls where either Greene's oil or Hidalgo's oil is shown in the upper position. However, due to the condition that no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Hidalgo must have a watercolor displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor. So, this scenario is possible and can be true.
C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  This is possible. We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. However, this does not restrict the position of Greene's oil in any way. Therefore, this scenario is possible and could be true.
D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
  This is possible as there are no restrictions on the position of Hidalgo's watercolor on any of the walls. Therefore, this scenario is possible and could be true.
E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  This scenario is possible as Isaacs's oils are shown on walls where either Greene's oil or Hidalgo's oil is shown in the upper position. Therefore, this scenario is possible and could be true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are four walls numbered from 1 to 4. Each wall displays two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position (totaling 8 paintings).
  There are four art students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student displays exactly two paintings, an oil and a watercolor.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Analysis:
  According to the conditions given, we know the following:
  - Each wall must have at least one oil and one watercolor painting.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, so each wall must have paintings from at least two of the four students.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Franz's watercolor is on the same wall as Greene's oil, it must be in the lower position.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be on one of the other three walls.
  With this information, we can evaluate each choice:

Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation:
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil. This can be true. Based on the given condition, it means Franz's oil is displayed with Hidalgo's watercolor on one of the other two walls. 
  B: Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, because that wall would have only two paintings from two students. So this cannot be true.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in a lower position because his watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the same wall. So this cannot be true.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor can be displayed in a lower position because Hidalgo's oil is displayed on one of the other three walls.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil because that wall would have only two paintings from two students. So this cannot be true.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Four students―Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs―will each display exactly two paintings in an exhibition.
  Two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls―walls 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  One painting will be in the upper position and the other in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. 
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Solution: 
  If we try to place the painting based on the given information, we get the result that either Hidalgo's oil -or- Greene's oil can be displayed in the upper position, and Hidalgo's watercolor -or- Greene's watercolor can be displayed in the lower position. All other positions and students have been determined. 

  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil. Possible, according to the given conditions.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. Possible.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. Possible.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position. Possible.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. Possible.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The exhibition room has four walls, numbered 1 through 4.
  - Each wall will display two paintings - one in upper position and the other in lower position.
  - Four art students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs - will display exactly two paintings each - an oil and a watercolor.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both Franz's and Isaacs's paintings displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Solution:
  - Let's try to eliminate each option using the given conditions.
  - From condition 4, to ensure that no wall has only one student's paintings, the pairs should be as follows:
    - (Franz's oil, Greene's watercolor), (Franz's watercolor, Hidalgo's oil), (Hidalgo's watercolor, Isaacs's oil).
  - From condition 2, we know that each wall will have at least one oil painting. Therefore, Greene's oil must either be with (Franz's watercolor, Hidalgo's oil) or with (Hidalgo's watercolor, Isaacs's oil), as these are the only two possibilities with either of Franz's paintings.
  - From condition 6, we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Thus, we can conclude that Hidalgo's watercolor must be in an upper position, and it can only be on wall 3. From this, we can deduce that Hidalgo's oil must be on wall 1, in a lower position.
  - Using the above deductions, we can create the following table:

    | Wall | Upper | Lower |
    |------|-------|-------|
    |  1   |  G O  |  H W  |
    |  2   |  I W  |  F O  |
    |  3   |  H O  |  I W  |
    |  4   |  F W  |  I O  |
    
    where - 
    - O - Oil painting, 
    - W - Watercolor, 
    - G - Greene, 
    - F - Franz, and 
    - I - Isaacs.
    
  - Using the above table, we can verify the given options.
    A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil. [This is true for wall 2]
    B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. [This is not possible as Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 1 in the lower position.]
    C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. [This is not possible as Greene's oil is displayed on wall 1 in a lower position.]
    D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position. [This is not possible as Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in an upper position on wall 3.]
    E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. [This is false for wall 3]

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We have four students- Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs, each with one oil and one watercolor painting.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room, with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Analysis:
  A cannot be true because if Franz's watercolor is on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's oil must be on another wall, thus violating the condition that says that no wall should display only one student's work.
  B cannot be true because if Franz's watercolor is on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Franz's oil must be on another wall, thus violating the condition that says that no wall should display only one student's work.
  C can be true as Greene's oil can be on the same wall where his watercolor is displayed in the upper position, and we can have one of the other student's painting displayed in the lower position.
  D can be true as there is no condition that prevents Hidalgo's watercolor from being displayed in the lower position.
  E cannot be true because no wall can have a painting by both Isaacs and Hidalgo.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Four students are displaying two paintings each at an exhibition. The paintings are divided equally into 4 walls with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position on each wall. Some conditions also apply, such as no wall having only watercolors, no wall having the work of only one student, and specifically mentioned paintings being on a specific wall position, etc.
  
A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then neither of them can have their painting(s) on walls 1 and 4 as Isaacs's oil is already in the lower position of wall 4. So, Franz and Greene both have to be on walls 2 and 3. This situation satisfies all the conditions mentioned and can be true, so this choice cannot be the answer. 

B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then one of them has to be on wall 4, but Isaacs's oil is already displayed in the lower position of wall 4, and no wall can have only one student's work displayed on it. Thus, this situation cannot be true.

C: Since Greene's oil is displayed in the lower position on wall 1, the only position remaining for Greene's watercolor is the upper position. Thus, this situation cannot be true, as it states the opposite.

D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in the lower position, then one of his/her oil paintings has to be in the upper position, but walls 1 and 4 are already occupied with other paintings. So, Hidalgo's oils have to be on walls 2 and 3, with watercolors on walls 1 and 4. This is possible and satisfies all the conditions mentioned, so this option cannot be the answer.

E: Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, and he cannot share a wall with Franz, his watercolor has to be on walls 2 and 3. On either wall, there is only one oil painting left to be displayed, which can be either Hidalgo's or Greene's. Thus, this situation can also be true and cannot be the answer.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert
  D: Kyle and Nina
  E: Olivia and Kyle
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Only six students will give individual oral reports during Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
Process of elimination:
  - George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Wednesday with anyone.
  - Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they can only give reports on Monday morning or Tuesday morning.
  - If Nina gives a report, then the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports (one in the morning and the other in the afternoon), unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - If we suppose that Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, and none of them will stay for Wednesday. But, with this possibility, we already have 7 students giving reports, and we need to choose only 6. So, we discard this possibility.
  - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday morning, Helen and Irving must both give reports in the afternoon, and the only remaining student left to give a report is Robert on Wednesday morning.
  - With Nina giving a report on Wednesday, we need two more students to give reports. We can select Olivia and Lenore for Monday, and Kyle and George for Tuesday. This completes the 6 reports with each day having a morning and an afternoon report.
  
Plan:
  Determine which pair(s) must give reports on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday morning, Helen and Irving must both give reports in the afternoon, and the only remaining student left to give a report is Robert on Wednesday morning. Therefore, Helen and Nina must give reports on Wednesday together.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Only six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days. 
  - Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. 
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
To work out which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday if they present together, we can use process of elimination based on the given conditions:
- George must present on Tuesday; 
- Olivia and Robert can't present in the afternoon; 
- If Nina presents, then the day after she presents, Helen and Irving both must present as well (unless Nina presents on Wednesday). So Nina can't be presenting on Tuesday. 

If we look at the remaining 5 students, there are only 4 combinations possible for Wednesday's presentations: 
- Helen & Irving (because Nina presented the day before) 
- Olivia & Lenore (because Olivia can't present in the afternoon) 
- Robert & Lenore (because Robert can't present in the afternoon) 
- Kyle & Lenore 

So, the pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday is Lenore and one of Kyle, Olivia or Robert. However, none of the choices provides a valid pair, so the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving both give a report unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  We want to find a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday.
  
  A: No information to suggest George and Lenore must give presentations on Wednesday together.
  B: Nina giving a report does not necessarily mean Helen and Irving give a presentation together on the next day.
  C: No information to suggest Irving and Robert must give presentations on Wednesday together.
  D: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must give a presentation together on Wednesday. But this doesn't suggest that Kyle and Nina must give a presentation together on Wednesday.
  E: If Olivia gives a morning report, Kyle must give an afternoon report. But this doesn't suggest that Olivia and Kyle must give a presentation together on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly two reports are given each day in the morning and afternoon, hence a maximum of six reports can be delivered over three days.
  2. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report. Thus, he cannot participate before or after Tuesday. 
  3. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report but they can participate in the morning session.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 

Solution:
From the given conditions, Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Thus, George cannot be one of the two persons who will present their reports on Wednesday because Wednesday is the only day where George can’t present. 
If Nina presents before Wednesday, then Irving and Helen must present on Wednesday, which means Nina cannot be one of the students who present on Wednesday because she can only present on Wednesday. 
Therefore, we cannot form a pair from George, Nina, Irving or Helen that will present on Wednesday because only one student among these four can present on Wednesday.
Thus, from the pairs left (Lenore, Olivia), (Kyle, Nina), and (Robert, Irving), the only pair left is (Robert, Irving).
Hence the answer is (C) Irving and Robert. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless it is on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports are given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  5. Exactly six students will give individual reports.

Working through the problem, we note that as there are only three days on which students will give reports, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, each student will give only one report. Also, since there are six reports in total, exactly three students, half of the eight, will give reports on Wednesday.

The only requirement for a student to give a report on Wednesday is that Nina does, so we can start by assuming Nina gives her report on Wednesday. Hence, according to condition 3, Irving and Helen will also give their reports on Wednesday. 
Since there are only two reports left on Wednesday, and since Robert cannot give an afternoon report, we know that Olivia, who can only give a morning report and Kyle, who has not been mentioned in any condition so far, will give reports on Wednesday.

Therefore, the students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday are Olivia and Kyle.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  2. Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

From condition 3, if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving will give a report one after the other on Wednesday.
If we assume that any pair of students in the list will give a report then we can come up with the following possibilities:
  - Monday: (1) (2), (3) (4), (5) (6), (7) (8)
  - Tuesday: (1) (3), (2) (7), (4) (6), (5) (8)
  - Wednesday: (1) (6), (2) (4), (3) (8), (5) (7)

Given the possibilities above, the only pair of students that can ONLY give report on Wednesday is Irving and Robert.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (not on the same day) Helen and Irving both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Only 6 students give reports, out of which 2 students give reports on each day.
  - So, one of the students must not give any report.

First, let's identify the students who cannot give an afternoon report: Olivia and Robert.

Now, let's list all the possible pairs of students, who may give reports on the same day:

Monday: (George, Lenore), (George, Kyle), (George, Nina), (Helen, Irving), (Helen, Olivia), (Helen, Robert), (Irving, Olivia), (Irving, Robert), (Kyle, Lenore), (Kyle, Nina), (Lenore, Nina)
Tuesday: (Helen, Irving), (Helen, Kyle), (Helen, Lenore), (Helen, Nina), (Irving, Kyle), (Irving, Lenore), (Irving, Nina), (Kyle, Lenore), (Kyle, Nina), (Lenore, Nina), (George cannot give his report if any of these pairs is selected, as he can only give his report on Tuesday)
Wednesday: (George is left to give his report), (Helen, Irving), (Helen, Kyle), (Helen, Lenore), (Helen, Nina), (Irving, Kyle), (Irving, Lenore), (Irving, Nina), (Kyle, Lenore), (Kyle, Nina), (Lenore, Nina), (Nina cannot give her report if (Helen, Irving) give their reports as it will break the given condition regarding Nina's report)

From the above pairs, we need to find the pairs which will give their reports only on Wednesday, and not on Monday or Tuesday.

Out of these pairs, only the pair (Helen, Nina) can give their reports only on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
  2. Exactly six students will give reports during these three days.
  3. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  4. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  5. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  6- If Nina gives a report, on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Logic to follow:
  * If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving both must give reports on Tuesday.
  * If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving both can give reports on either Wednesday or Monday.
  * If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then the other two reports must be given on Monday and Tuesday, in that order.
  * If George cannot give a report on Wednesday, then George must give a report on Monday
  * If George gives a report on Monday, then the other two reports on Monday must be given by Olivia and Robert.
  * If George gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving both must give reports on Monday.
  * If George gives a report on Tuesday then Helen and Irving could be scheduled for Monday or Wednesday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  4. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  5. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon
Analysis:
  1. From condition 1, we know that George must give his report on Tuesday.
  2. From condition 2, we know that Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports.
  3. From condition 3, we can infer that Nina's report cannot be on Tuesday. Therefore, either it will be on Monday and then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, or it will be on Wednesday and then Helen and Irving can either give their reports on Monday and Tuesday, or both give their reports on Wednesday.
  4. If Nina gives her report on Monday, then there will be only one student left who hasn't given a report, and that student must give their report on Wednesday. That means that no two students who give reports on the same day can both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if any pair of students give reports on the same day, and one of them gives their report on Wednesday, then the other must give their report on Monday or Tuesday.
  5. From the above analysis, we can eliminate choices A, B, and E. None of those pairs of students can be on Wednesday together.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  2. The reports will be given during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Process of elimination:
  * George must give a report on Tuesday, so he can't give a report on Wednesday.
  * If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then on Wednesday Helen and Irving must both give reports. Therefore, if Helen or Irving give a report on Wednesday, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday, so the only day Nina can give a report is Wednesday.
  * If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to both give reports on the next day.
  * Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.

Possible scenarios:
  
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday and Kyle and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. Bob and Olivia cannot give reports.
  
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then George must give a report on the same day and Helen and Irving must give reports the next day. Olivia and Kyle will give reports on Wednesday and Lenore and Robert cannot give reports.
  
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Kyle and Olivia must give reports on Monday, Helen and Irving on Tuesday and George and Lenore on Wednesday.

Final deduction:
  Based on the possible scenarios, the only pairs that must give reports on Wednesday are George and Lenore.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven businesses: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.
Analysis:
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy cannot be in space 2 because pharmacy must be at one end or the optometrist/veterinarian space. Therefore, option B is not possible. Also, the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 1, because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian or the pharmacy. Therefore, option D and option B are not possible. 
Answer:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5. 
    Reasoning: The pharmacy cannot be in space 1 because it would violate the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end. If the optometrist or veterinarian is in space 1 (because the pharmacy must be next to either of them), then the pharmacy must be in space 2, which is already occupied by the shoe store. The toy store cannot be in space 4 because it is next to the veterinarian. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since the pharmacy is at one end and one of the restaurants at the other, that leaves only two possible arrangements: a restaurant, the toy store, the veterinarian, the optometrist, a restaurant, the pharmacy, and the shoe store or the reverse order. Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 5.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The shopping center has 7 spaces (1 through 7).
  There are 7 businesses to be placed (optometrist, pharmacy, 2 restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian).
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 2, the optometrist cannot occupy space 1.
  
Analysis:
If the shoe store is in space 2, the optometrist cannot occupy space 1. This means that the only way the pharmacy can be located at one end of the row is if it is in space 1. One of the restaurants must be at the other end; this is therefore possible. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses; this means that the optometrist and the veterinarian must be in spaces 3 and 4, in some order. Finally, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian; this means that the toy store must be in space 5, and the veterinarian must be in space 6.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - There are 7 spaces, numbered from 1 to 7, in a straight row.
  - There are 7 businesses: an optometrist, a pharmacy, 2 restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at either end.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is located in space 2.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the shoe store is in space 2, we know that space 1 and space 3 cannot be the pharmacy because that would violate the condition that the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  A: If the optometrist is in space 5, then there is no room for one of the restaurants because of the gap required between the two restaurants.
  B: If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist/veterinarian must be in space 2, which is not allowed.
  C: If a restaurant is in space 3, then the other restaurant must be in space 7, which means the pharmacy is next to the optometrist/veterinarian, violating the constraint.
  D: If the toy store is in space 6, then the veterinarian must be in space 5, which violates the condition that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  E: The only option left is that the veterinarian is in space 4, which works with the other constraints.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven businesses, one in each of seven spaces (1-7).
  - The layout is constrained:
    - The pharmacy must be at one end, and one of the restaurants at the other end.
    - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
    - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
    - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the shoe store is in space 2, spaces 1 and 7 are the only spaces left for the pharmacy and the restaurant at the ends.
 
Analysis:
  - If the shoe store is in space 2, the restaurant at the end cannot be in space 1.
  - The pharmacy must be next to the shoe store, so the pharmacy cannot be in space 7.
  - If the pharmacy is in space 1, the only option left for one of the restaurants is space 4. Then, the optometrist and the veterinarian would have to be in spaces 3 and 5. This means the toy store would have to be in space 6, which works with the constraints.
  - None of the other options would work given the constraints.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in total.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  - Two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 2.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other end, spaces 1 and 7 must be occupied by the pharmacy and one of the two restaurants. 
  - Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the vacant spaces between the two restaurants are 3 and 4 or 4 and 5.
  - Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, there are two possible arrangements for the pharmacy, optometrist, and veterinarian: 
      (1) pharmacy-optometrist-veterinarian, or 
      (2) veterinarian-optometrist-pharmacy
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
  - Since the shoe store is in space 2, then space 3 and 1 cannot be a restaurant or a pharmacy based on the restrictions.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: If the shoe store is in space 2, space 1 must be the pharmacy and space 7 must be one of the restaurants. Based on the restrictions, the toy store cannot be in spaces 3 or 5, so there are two valid combinations: 
(1) space 3 restaurant, space 4 optometrist, space 5 veterinarian, space 6 toy store, and 
(2) space 3 optometrist, space 4 veterinarian, space 5 restaurant, space 6 toy store. Therefore, the toy store could be in space 6.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the optometrist and veterinarian cannot be located in spaces 1, 3, or 4.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then one of the restaurants (let's say restaurant A) must be in space 7, which means restaurant B must be located in space 3 or 4. Since the shoe store is in space 2, optometrist and veterinarian cannot be located in spaces 1, 3, or 4. Therefore, if the pharmacy is in space 1, the optometrist/veterinarian can only be located in space 5 or 6. This means space 3 or 4 must be one of the restaurants, leaving only one possible location for the toy store (space 7) and the last restaurant would be placed in space 6. Therefore, answer B is valid. Answers A, C, D, and E are not possible.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The shoe store is located in space 2.
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Action: 
- Based on the restriction that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, the pharmacy cannot be in space 2. Eliminate B and D.
- Space 1 is the only remaining option for the pharmacy, so A must also be eliminated.
- If the restaurant is not in space 1, then it must be in space 7 due to the restriction that one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row from the pharmacy. This means that no restaurant can be in space 3, B is the correct answer. 
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  A shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a straight row, and seven businesses are to be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  The pharmacy must be located at either end of the row and needs to be next to either the optometrist or veterinarian.
  One of the two restaurants must be at the opposite end of the row from the pharmacy.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  The shoe store is in space 2.
  
Analysis:
  Because the pharmacy needs to be at either end of the row and next to either the optometrist or veterinarian, and because the two restaurant locations (which must be separated by at least two businesses) are specified, we can create the following hypothetical layout of the businesses: 
  (pharmacy), O or V, _, R, _, R, (pharmacy)
  where O is the optometrist, V is the veterinarian and R is a restaurant. 
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so if the shoe store is in space 2, the layout of the businesses could be:
  (pharmacy), O, S, R, T, R, (pharmacy)
  where S is the shoe store and T is the toy store. 
  Therefore, A, B, and E are not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- There are seven spaces, numbered 1 through 7.
- There are seven businesses, one business per space: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants at the other end.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
- If the shoe store is in space 2, then it is impossible for the optometrist to be in space 5 because there is only one space between the shoe store at space 2 and the pharmacy at one end or the restaurant at the other end of the row.
- If the shoe store is in space 2, it is possible for the pharmacy to be in space 1 if the restaurant is at the other end of the row.
- If the shoe store is in space 2, it is possible for a restaurant to be in space 3. It is also possible for a restaurant to be in space 7.
- If the shoe store is in space 2 and a restaurant is in space 3, then the only spaces remaining for the other businesses are 4, 5, 6, and 7. Therefore, it is possible for the toy store to be in space 6, but it is not possible for the veterinarian to be in space 4.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- There are seven spaces numbered 1 to 7 arranged in a straight row.
- Seven stores - optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store and veterinarian - will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
- The pharmacy must occupy one of two end spaces.
- One restaurant must occupy the other end.
- The two restaurants must be a distance of at least two other stores apart.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian if it is present.

Action: 
- If the shoe store is in space 2, then it must be surrounded by the pharmacy and the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1.
- Also, according to the constraints, we know one of the restaurants must be at one of the ends, so it is not possible for a restaurant to be in space 3.
- If the pharmacy is not in space 1, then it must be at the end opposite to the restaurant meaning that the pharmacy would be in space 7.
- Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 3.
- The veterinarian cannot be in space 1 nor in space 4 due to the toy store constraint, so it must be in space 6.
- This leaves only the space 4 for the second restaurant and the space 5 for the toy store.
- Answer: Choice A is false. Choice B is false. Choice C is false. Choice D is true. Choice E is false. 
Therefore, the answer is Answer("D").

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The lectures are on four topics—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each art historian will give one lecture, on one of the topics.
  The lectures will be given one at a time.
  There are five possible lectures orders, but the lithographs must be the last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The watercolors lecture is third.
 
Analysis:
  According to the constraints, the order of the lectures can be in two possible orders: 
  1) Watercolor - Oil - Sculptures - Lithographs or
  2) Watercolor - Sculptures - Oil - Lithographs
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so option A is not possible.
  Garcia must give the third lecture, so options C and E are not possible.
  Holden must come before Garcia and Jiang, so option D is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The schedule of the lectures has the following constraints:
  - oil paintings and watercolors lectures before the lithographs lecture
  - Farley's lecture before the oil paintings lecture
  - Holden's lecture before both Garcia's and Jiang's lectures

Solution:
  Since the watercolors lecture is third and oil paintings and watercolors lectures must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be the second lecture. Farley's lecture must be before the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture must be first. Holden's lecture must be before both Garcia's and Jiang's lectures, so Holden's lecture must be the third lecture. Therefore, the watercolors lecture is fourth, and Jiang must give the lithographs lecture. So the possible true statement is:
Option A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
Option B, C, D, and E violate one or several constraints.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are four lectures with the following topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. 
  No two art historians can give a lecture on the same topic.
  Oil paintings and watercolors must be given before lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

Since the watercolors lecture is third, we know that:
- Watercolors cannot be given first or second.
- Watercolors must be given before lithographs.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

A: Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture since the watercolors lecture is not the first or second lecture.
B: According to the constraints, oil paintings cannot be given before watercolors.
C: Garcia could give the sculptures lecture. For example, if the schedule order is: Farley–watercolors, Holden–oil paintings, Garcia–sculptures, Jiang–lithographs.
D: Holden must lecture before Garcia, Jiang, and the watercolors lecture. Therefore, Holden cannot give the sculptures lecture since it follows the watercolors lecture.
E: According to the constraints, lithographs can only be given after both oil paintings and watercolors have been given, so Jiang must give the lithographs lecture.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - Given that the watercolor lecture is third, it means that the fourth lecture must be the lithographs lecture. 

Analysis:
  - We know that the lithographs lectures is the last lecture, therefore it must be given by Jiang because Garcia and Holden cannot give lectures after the watercolor one.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley could have given either the sculptures or the watercolor lecture. 
  - If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia will give the oil paintings lecture. 
  - Therefore, (D) Holden gives the sculptures lecture, is the most possible correct answer.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are four lectures with different topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
- The lectures will be given one at a time and each art historian will give a lecture on a different topic.
- The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.
- If the watercolors lecture is third, it means two lectures should go before it.
- The order of the lectures would be Farley, Holden, Watercolors, Garcia/Jiang, Oil paintings/lithographs.

Analysis:
Option A is not possible because Farley must speak before the oil paintings lecture, and the watercolors lecture is third, meaning that Farley's lecture must have happened already.

Option B is not possible because the oil paintings lecture must either come after Farley's lecture or after the watercolors lecture.

Option C is possible since the order of the lectures would be Farley, Holden, Watercolors, Garcia, Sculptures, Jiang, Lithographs, Oil paintings.

Option D is not possible because we already know that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's, and the orders of the lectures would be Farley, Holden, Watercolors, Garcia, Jiang, Lithographs, Oil paintings. Since Garcia's lecture must come after Holden's lecture, Holden cannot give the sculptures lecture.

Option E is not possible because if the watercolors lecture is third, then the lithographs lecture must come after the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Jiang cannot give the lithographs lecture since the oil paintings lecture cannot be scheduled yet.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
  There are four public lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each art historian will give a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  The lectures will be given one at a time.
  The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints:
    1. The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    2. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    3. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The watercolors lecture is third.
  
Analysis: 
  Since the watercolors lecture is third, we know that both the oil paintings lecture and the lithographs lecture will be later than the watercolors lecture. We also know that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley must give a lecture before the third lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden's lecture must be either the first or the second. Now let's consider each option:
  A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden must give the first lecture (since Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture). But this is impossible, because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which would be the second lecture in this case. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley must give the watercolors lecture (since Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture), and Holden must give the first lecture (since Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture). This is consistent with all of the constraints, so this option could be true.
  C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Farley must give either the watercolors lecture or the oil paintings lecture, which is not possible because the watercolors lecture is third and Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden must give the first lecture (since Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture), which means that Farley must give the watercolors lecture (since Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture), and Garcia must give the second lecture (since the oil paintings lecture would be the third lecture in this case). This is consistent with all of the constraints, so this option could be true.
  E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then Holden must give the first lecture (since Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture), which means that Farley must give the watercolors lecture (since Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture), and Garcia must give the second lecture (since the oil paintings lecture would be the third lecture in this case). But the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture is violated in this case. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are four topics for the lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each art historian will give only one lecture on one topic.
  The schedule must follow these constraints:
    1. Oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture are both earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    2. Farley's lecture is earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    3. Holden's lecture is earlier than both Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.
  
If the watercolors lecture is third, then:
  1. Oil painting and lithograph lectures will be given after the watercolors lecture.
  2. Farley's lecture will be given before the oil paintings lecture.
  3. Holden's lecture will be given before Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.

A: Farley must give the first lecture before the oil paintings lecture, so it is not possible for him to give the third lecture on watercolors lecture. Therefore, A is false.
B: Since oil painting is later than watercolors, Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lectures if watercolors lecture is already given in the third slot. Therefore, B is false.
C: Given that Garcia cannot give oil paintings lecture, and Jiang cannot give the lecture on lithographs since it is the last lecture, Garcia has to give the lecture on sculptures. Therefore, C is true.
D: Holden's lecture has to be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lectures, so it is not possible for Holden to give the lecture on sculptures which is the fourth lecture. Therefore, D is false.
E: Jiang cannot give the lecture on oil paintings or watercolors as each has already been taken by Farley and Holden. Also, Jiang cannot give the first two lectures as they are taken by Farley and Holden respectively. Therefore, Jiang must give the lecture on lithographs which is the last one. Thus, E is true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- There are four lectures, on the topics of lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
- Each lecture is given by one of four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, or Jiang.
- Each art historian gives one lecture.
- The lectures are given one at a time, in some order.
- The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
- Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
- If the watercolors lecture is third, then either the sculptures or the lithographs lecture must be last.

Analysis:
If watercolors is third:
- Then, the oil paintings lecture must be first or second. 
- Farley must give his lecture before the oil paintings lecture.
- Therefore, both Farley's lecture and the watercolors lecture must be given in either the first and second slots, or the first three slots.
- Holden must give his lecture before Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.
- Garcia and Jiang's lectures must both be given after the first two lectures.
- Therefore, the only possible positions for each lecture are:
  - Lecture 1: Oil paintings (given by Garcia or Jiang).
  - Lecture 2: Farley (with oil paintings lecture in slot 1) or oil paintings (with Farley's lecture in slot 1 and oil paintings lecture given by Garcia or Jiang).
  - Lecture 3: Watercolors (given by Farley, Garcia, Holden, or Jiang).
  - Lecture 4: Sculptures (given by Holden, Garcia, or Jiang) or lithographs (given by Jiang).

Test of each choice:
  - A: Farley could give the watercolors lecture in slot 3, AND he must give his lecture before the oil paintings lecture. So in this case, it must be that Farley gave the first or second lecture, and either Garcia or Jiang gave the oil paintings lecture in the other slot. This is possible, so A could be true.
  - B: The watercolors lecture is in slot 3, so the oil paintings lecture must be in slot 1 or 2, and if the oil paintings lecture is given in slot 1, then Farley gives his lecture in slot 2, which means Holden gives his lecture before Garcia and Jiang, which is impossible, so the oil paintings lecture must be given in slot 2, and Farley must give his lecture in slot 1. This leaves only slot 4 for Garcia and Jiang. Therefore, Garcia could not give the oil paintings lecture, so B is not true.
  - C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the first three lectures must be: oil paintings, Farley, watercolors. This would mean that Holden must give the lithographs lecture, which is impossible since Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lectures. So C is not true.
  - D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then the order of the first three lectures must be: oil paintings, Farley, watercolors. This would mean that Garcia and Jiang must give the fourth lecture together, one giving lithographs and the other giving sculptures. This is possible, so D could be true.
  - E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the order of the first three lectures must be: oil paintings, Farley, watercolors. This would mean that Garcia and Holden must give the fourth lecture together, one giving sculptures and the other giving lithographs. This is possible, so E could be true.

Answer: 
Therefore, the possible true statements are:
  - A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  - D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  - E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.

Action: Answer("ADE")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

Let's make a timeline to better understand the constraints:
Farley   ?   Oil   Water  Lithographs
         <   <        <         <
Holden   ?   ?  Garcia/Jiang      <
 
Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. This means that Holden's lecture must be either the first or second. The earliest possible lecture that can be given is Holden's lecture, followed by Farley's lecture, then the Watercolors lecture, then either Garcia or Jiang's lecture, and Lithographs must be last.

If the Watercolors lecture is third, then Farley's lecture must be second. It is not possible for Garcia or Jiang's lecture to be second, since Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. - False, Farley gives the second lecture which cannot be the watercolors lecture.
B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. - False, Oil paintings lecture is second, before the watercolors lecture, and Farley must give the second lecture.
C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. - True, Garcia gives the third lecture and sculptures lecture is last.
D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. - False, Holden must give the first or second lecture and sculptures lecture must be last.
E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. - False, Lithographs lecture is last and has to be given after Garcia and Jiang's lecture.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Four art historians - Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang will give a series of four public lectures, each on a different topic - lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  Constraints: 
    1. oil paintings lecture and watercolors lecture are before lithographs lecture.
    2. Farley's lecture is before oil paintings lecture.
    3. Holden's lecture is before Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

From the constraints, we can infer that:
- Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture. If watercolors lecture is third, then the only possible lecture for Farley is the sculptures lecture.
- Holden's lecture must be first or second. If the watercolors lecture is third, then Holden will give the oil paintings or sculptures lecture.
- Garcia's lecture must be last. If the watercolors lecture is third, then Garcia can give only the lithographs or oil paintings lecture.

Analysis of Choices:
A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. This choice is not possible because watercolors lecture is already third.
B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. This choice is not possible because Holden must give his lecture before Garcia's and Holden's lecture cannot be the watercolors lecture.
C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. This choice is possible because Holden can give the oil paintings lecture and Farley can give the lithographs lecture.
D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. This choice is possible because Farley can give the watercolors lecture and Garcia can give the lithographs lecture.
E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. This choice is not possible because the lithographs lecture is given after the oil paintings and watercolors lecture. If Jiang's lecture is last, then neither oil paintings nor watercolors can be after it.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable assignment of photographers to the two graduation ceremonies?
Choices:
  A: Silva University: Gonzalez, Lai Thorne University: Frost, Heideck, Mays
  B: Silva University: Gonzalez, Mays Thorne University: Knutson, Lai
  C: Silva University: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck Thorne University: Knutson, Lai, Mays
  D: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays Thorne University: Gonzalez, Lai
  E: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays Thorne University: Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The photography business manager must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Action: Answer("E")  
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  * Two photographers are assigned to each ceremony.
  * Exactly six photographers are available but not all have to be assigned.
  * Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony.
  * If Lai and Mays are both assigned they must be assigned to different ceremonies.
  * Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva ceremony if Lai is not assigned to the Thorne ceremony.
  * If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne ceremony, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Solution:
  * The problem can be solved by assigning photographers one by one and checking the constraints.
  * Frost and Heideck have to be assigned together to one of the ceremonies, so we may assume Frost and Heideck are assigned to Silva ceremony.
  * Knutson must be assigned to Thorne if Heideck and Lai are assigned to the Silva ceremony. So Heideck and Lai must be assigned to Thorne ceremony.
  * By the third constraint, if Gonzalez is assigned to Silva ceremony, Lai must be assigned to Thorne. If Lai is already assigned to Thorne, then Gonzalez cannot be assigned to Silva.
  * If Gonzalez is not assigned to Silva ceremony, and both Lai and Mays cannot be assigned to Thorne because of the second constraint, then Mays must be assigned to Silva ceremony.
  * Gonzalez cannot be assigned to Thorne and Knutson cannot be assigned to Thorne according to the fourth and fifth constraint, and there is no more photographer left to assign to Thorne ceremony.

Result:
  * Only C satisfies all constraints.
  * No other option satisfies all the constraints.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly two photographers must be assigned to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Six photographers are available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are assigned to different ceremonies, then only one of them can be assigned.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University ceremony, then Heideck and Mays must both be assigned to it.
  
Solution:
  Start with S = {Frost-Heideck, Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai, Mays}. Based on given constraints, we can determine following:
  - Since Frost-Heideck must be assigned together, and each ceremony requires two photographers, one of Frost-Heideck pair must be assigned to Silva University ceremony and the other must be assigned to Thorne University ceremony.
  - From the constraint “If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies” and “No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies”, we have the following cases
      Case 1: Lai is assigned to Silva University ceremony and Mays is not assigned to any ceremony
      Case 2: Mays is assigned to Thorne University ceremony and Lai is not assigned to any ceremony
  - From “If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne University ceremony” constraint we get following possibilities
      Possibility 1: Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University ceremony and Lai is assigned to Thorne University ceremony
      Possibility 2: Gonzalez is not assigned to Silva University ceremony and either Lai or Mays are assigned to Silva University ceremony and other photographer is assigned to Thorne University ceremony
  - From “If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it” constraint,
        Possibility 1: If Knutson is assigned to Thorne University ceremony, only one of Heideck or Mays can be assigned to it
        Possibility 2: If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University ceremony, both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it
  Using these constraints, we can determine if each answer choice is valid.
  A: Silva University: Frost-Heideck, Gonzalez, Thorne University: Lai, Mays. It does not fulfill the condition that Knutson must be assigned to Thorne University ceremony if both Heideck and Mays are not assigned to it.
  B: Silva University: Gonzalez, Mays, Thorne University: Knutson, Lai. It satisfies all given constraints.
  C: Silva University: Frost-Heideck, Gonzalez, Thorne University: Knutson, Lai, Mays. It violates "If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it" constraint.
  D: Silva University: Frost-Heideck, Mays, Thorne University: Gonzalez, Lai. It violates "Gonzalez must be assigned to Silva University ceremony and Lai must be assigned to Thorne University ceremony" constraint.
  E: Silva University: Frost-Heideck, Mays, Thorne University: Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai. It violates "No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies" constraint.
  Therefore, the only valid option is Answer("B").
Response 3:
Knowledge: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony. Lai and Mays, if assigned, must be assigned to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to one ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the other ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
 
A: Frost and Heideck can't be separated, and Gonzalez and Lai must be assigned to different ceremonies if both are chosen. This assignment violates both rules.
B: This assignment violates the rule that both Heideck and Mays must be assigned if Knutson isn't assigned. 
C: This assignment satisfies all the rules. Frost and Heideck both go to Silva University, Knutson goes to Thorne University, and the other three - Gonzalez, Lai, and Mays - form the remaining members of the two teams.
D: This assignment violates the rule that if Gonzalez is assigned to one ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the other ceremony.
E: This assignment violates the rule that if Gonzalez is assigned to one ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the other ceremony.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The manager of photography business has to assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  The photographers available for the assignment are: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
To solve this problem we need to apply the constraints provided. 
Knowledge: Frost has to be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned they have to be assigned to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
We can also use elimination starting from the ones that violate the constraints:
A: Frost has to be assigned together with Heideck to one of the ceremonies.
B: If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
C: This assignment violates the constraint that Lai and Mays cannot be both assigned to the same place.
D: This assignment violates the constraint that if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
E: This is the only one that does not violate any of the constraints.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Exactly two photographers must be assigned to each of the two graduation ceremonies.
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Eliminating options:
  Option A: Gonzalez and Lai must be assigned to different ceremonies, so this option is not valid.
  Option B: If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne ceremony, both Heideck and Mays must be, but neither is assigned to it. This option is not valid.
  Option C: Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, and Lai is assigned to Thorne but with Knutson, who is not assigned to the Thorne ceremony. This option is invalid.
  Option D: Frost, Heideck, and Mays are assigned to the Silva ceremony, which is allowed since Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, Lai and Gonzalez are assigned to the Thorne ceremony. This is a valid option.
  Option E: Frost, Heideck, and Mays are assigned to the Silva ceremony, which is allowed since Frost and Heideck must be assigned together. Knutson, Lai, and Gonzalez are assigned to the Thorne ceremony, which is also allowed. This is a valid option.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The assignment of photographers has to comply with the given constraints, where:
  - Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony.
  - Lai and Mays must be assigned to different ceremonies if both are assigned.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
A: Silva University: Gonzalez and Lai, Thorne University: Frost, Heideck, Mays.
  - Frost and Heideck are together, as prescribed, however, there are Gonzalez and Lai assigned together, which violates the constraint that if Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne. 
B: Silva University: Gonzalez and Mays, Thorne University: Knutson and Lai.
  - None of the pairs of photographers that must be assigned together are together in the same ceremony. Gonzalez is to Silva, Lai is to Thorne, and Frost, Heideck, Mays, are excluded. This option does not meet any constraint.
C: Silva University: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Thorne University: Knutson, Lai, Mays 
  - Gonzalez and Lai are not assigned together in any ceremony which complies with the constraint. Frost and Heideck are assigned together as prescribed and the condition about Knutson is satisfied too. Hence, this is a valid solution.
D: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays, Thorne University: Gonzalez, Lai 
  - Frost and Heideck are together, as prescribed, but Gonzalez is assigned to Thorne and Lai is assigned to Silva, both of which violates the constraints. This option is not valid. 
E: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays, Thorne University: Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai
  - Frost and Heideck are assigned together as prescribed, but Knutson is assigned to Thorne, whereas the constraint says that if Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, this is not a valid option.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The manager of the photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  - Exactly six photographers are available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  - No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  - If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Analysis:
  A: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together. Lai and Mays are not assigned to different ceremonies, which is required.
  B: Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which means both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, this is not an acceptable assignment.
  C: Frost and Heideck are assigned together. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which means both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  D: Frost and Heideck are assigned together. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. However, in this option Lai is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which is not allowed.
  E: Frost and Heideck are assigned together. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which means both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Action: Answer("E")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are three botanists—F, G, and H.
  There are three chemists—K, L, and M.
  There are three zoologists—P, Q, and R.
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  In this scenario, P is the only zoologist selected.
  
  If K is selected, then at most one botanist can be selected. So, G cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, there is no condition that restricts selection of F. So, option B is not valid.
  If only one chemist is selected, we cannot know for sure which one of the chemists will be selected. So, option C cannot be the answer.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then either K and L or K and M will be selected, and F can still be selected in both cases. So, option D cannot be the answer.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then they will be K and L or K and M. If K and L are selected, then G can be selected. If K and M are selected, then G cannot be selected. So, option E is the answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists). 
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. 
  F and K cannot both be selected. 
  K and M cannot both be selected. 
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected since the panel has to include at least one scientist of each type (botanists, chemists, and zoologists)
  
Action: Answer("B") 

If P is the only zoologist selected, it means that we have one zoologist, two botanists, and two chemists left to select. Since we cannot select more than one zoologist, then we must select one botanist and one chemist. Since F and K cannot be both selected and K cannot be selected if M is selected, and M must be selected if P is the only zoologist, then M cannot be selected. This means we have to select L as one of the chemists. We know that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, so we cannot select G since we already have two botanists. Therefore, F must be selected. 
So the panel will contain: F (botanist), L (chemist), P (zoologist), and two more scientists that can be any of the remaining six. Therefore, we can conclude that if L is selected, F cannot be selected, which is choice B.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - A panel of five needs at least one scientist from each type (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected and K and M cannot both be selected.

Analysis:
  - Since P is the only zoologist, Q and R cannot be selected.
  - At least one botanist must be selected.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, at most one botanist can be selected.
  - If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected, which means F cannot be selected.

Action: Answer("D")  
Reasoning: If exactly two chemists are selected, then there can only be at most one botanist selected. Also, if M is selected, meaning P and R have to be selected, then F and K cannot be selected. Thus, if exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  We need at least one scientist from each of the three types: botanist, chemist and zoologist
  If more than one Botanist is selected, at most one zoologist can be selected.
  If M is selected, P and R must also be selected.
  Both F and K cannot be selected.
  Both K and M cannot be selected.
  
Solution:
  If only one zoologist is selected, then we must have either two botanists and two chemists or one botanist, two chemists and one zoologist. But the first option is not possible since if we select two botanists, then we can select at most one zoologist. So, there must be one botanist, two chemists and one zoologist. Now, if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected, so M cannot be selected. And if M is not selected, then we must select K and either L or M to have two chemists. Now let's analyze each option:
  A: If K is selected, then we must select L and P as well as a botanist. If we select G and K, then we can still select F and not violate any conditions. So, this option is not necessarily true.
  B: If L is selected, then we must select K and P as well as a botanist. As long as we don't select M and R, we are not violating any conditions, and we can still select F and G. So, this option is not necessarily true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, then it must be L. So, this option is not true.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, then we must select K and L. In this case, we can still select F and G as botanists and P as a zoologist, so this option is not true.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, then we must select K and L. In this case, we can still select F and P, but we cannot select G since we have already selected two botanists. So, this option is true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
To make the panel, five scientists will be selected from a pool of 9 scientists: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, and R.
- The panel must include at least one scientist from each of the three types: botanists(F, G, H), chemists(K, L, M), and zoologists(P, Q, R).
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

If we proceed with P as the only zoologist, then the other two types of scientists must be represented by two botanists and two chemists. Therefore, we can rule out options C, D, and E as they deal with selecting only one chemist. 

Option A - It is possible to select both K and G on the panel. Therefore, the statement in option A is not always true. 

Option B - If L is selected, then F and K are eliminated as they cannot be selected together, thereby satisfying the requirement for at most one botanist to be selected. Therefore, the statement in option B is always true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  A panel of five scientists is to be formed from three botanists, three chemists, and three zoologists.
  The panel should have at least one scientist from each type.
  If we have more than one botanist, at most one zoologist can be selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R are not selected.
  F cannot be selected if K and L are selected.
  
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. (This relationship cannot be inferred)
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. (This is correct, since if L is selected, we cannot select K. This means that we cannot have F and K both in the panel)
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. (This cannot be inferred)
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. (This is correct, as the two chemists selected can be L and M. This means that we cannot select K and F together)
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. (This cannot be inferred)
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are three botanists, three chemists, and three zoologists and at least one scientist of each of three types is selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  We know that P is the only zoologist selected.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
  Since P is the only zoologist selected, at least one botanist and at least one chemist must be selected. 
  If F is the only selected botanist, then we can select the only chemist which is neither K nor M because F and K or M can't be selected together. Then, we can select P as the only zoologist.
  If two botanists are selected, at most one zoologist can be selected but we know that P is the only selected zoologist. Hence, there can be only one botanist. 
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Then we have only one available chemist and one available botanist. So, we can combine the only remaining chemist and the only remaining botanist with P to obey the rules.
  Therefore, F can't be selected if exactly two chemists are selected because if F is selected, at least two botanists will be selected which violates the rule provided in the question. Hence, the answer is D.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The panel consists of 5 scientists, with at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
- If more than one botanist is selected, there can be at most one zoologist.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Working:
- If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two scientists must be one botanist and one chemist.
- Also, if only one zoologist is selected, then more than one botanist cannot be selected.

A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
- There must be at least one botanist, and if K is selected, then the botanists must be F and H, which means that G will not be selected. This statement must be true.
B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
- If L is selected, the other two chemists must be K and M. None of the botanists can be selected if F is not selected. This statement cannot be true.
C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
- There must be at least one botanist, and if only one chemist is selected and it is not K, then the other two scientists must be botanist F and zoologist P, which is not possible given that there must be exactly one chemist. This statement must be true.
D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
- If only one botanist is selected, then the other two scientists must be a chemist and a zoologist, and if two chemists are selected, then two zoologists cannot be selected. Therefore, the other two scientists must be F and P, which means F has to be selected. This statement cannot be true.
E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
- If exactly two chemists are selected, then there must be exactly one botanist. If chemists K and L are selected, then botanist G must be selected. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each type
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected. 
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then there must be at least one botanist and one chemist on the panel. 
  We can eliminate options C, D, and E based on this knowledge.

  A: If K is selected, then M must not be selected as K and M cannot both be on the panel. But if M is not selected, then P and R cannot both be selected. Therefore, G must be selected. However, this does not lead to a contradiction, so this may be true.
  
  B: If L is selected, then at most one botanist can be on the panel, which means that F is not selected. This is a necessary condition, so this must be true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
If P is the only zoologist selected, then there must also be at least one botanist and one chemist on the panel. 
If L is selected from the chemists, then K cannot be selected (given F must be selected if G is not selected). Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected (given F and K cannot be selected together).
So, B is true: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives, Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall, to work in its three sales zones - Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1; Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than Zone 2.
  
  We need to determine who among the choices cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  
Solution:
  First, we find which sales representatives are already assigned to a sales zone with Quinn. According to the given conditions, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone. Therefore, Parra must also work in the same sales zone as Quinn. 
  
  Next, we know Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. But this information is not helpful in determining who cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn. 
  
  From the given conditions, it is impossible to determine whether Kim, Mahr, Tiao, or Udall works in the same sales zone as Quinn. 
  
  Therefore, we cannot determine who among the choices cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  We need to identify sales representatives that Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone based on the conditions given.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
We know that Parra works in the same sales zone as Quinn, while the combination of Stuckey and Udall also work in the same sales zone.  Since there are only three sales zones, this means that either Tiao or Udall work in the second sales zone, and either Parra or Tiao work in the first sales zone. This leaves Kim and Mahr in the third sales zone. 

Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  For Quinn to work in the same sales zone as another representative, Parra must be that representative, since Quinn works with Parra, Stuckey works with Udall, either Parra or Tiao but not both works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall but not both works in Zone 2. It follows that Tiao works in Zone 1 and Udall works in Zone 2. There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  A: We do not know where Kim works
  B: We do not know where Mahr works
  C: Stuckey works with Udall, so Quinn can work with Stuckey in that sales zone
  D: Tiao must work in Zone 1, so Quinn and Parra both work in Zone 3
  E: Udall works in Zone 2, so Quinn and Stuckey both work in Zone 3
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are exactly 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall
  2. There are exactly 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3
  3. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  4. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  5. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  6. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  7. More of the sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Parra and Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as each other since Parra and Tiao (not both) works in Zone 1. However, that would leave only one sales representative (either Kim or Mahr) in Zone 3 which would contradict the fact that more of them work in Zone 3 than Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall
  Three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Using the given conditions, if Quinn works in the same zone as Stuckey and Udall, then the other sales reps who are working in Zone 3 would be Kim, Mahr, and either Parra or Tiao.
  - When either Parra or Tiao is selected to work in Zone 1, the other one would work in the remaining zone, i.e. Zone 2.
  - However, in this situation, we would have Tiao in Zone 2 and Udall in that case would be in another zone, which contradicts the given conditions.
Hence, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Tiao.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  There are seven sales representatives in total.
Action: Quinn cannot work in the same zone as Stuckey or Udall because they both work in the same sales zone as each other. 
Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To determine who Quinn cannot work with, we need to figure out who he is already working with:
  -Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
So, Quinn is working in the same sales zone as Parra.

Now, we need to determine who of the remaining sales representatives cannot be in the same sales zone as Quinn, given the other conditions:
  -Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. (This doesn't help us determine who Quinn can't work with)
  -Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. (This doesn't help us determine who Quinn can't work with)
  -Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. (This also doesn't help us determine who Quinn can't work with)
  -There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

We don't know exactly who is working in each of the zones, but we do know what zone Quinn is not in. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Quinn is not working in Zone 2 (because Parra and Quinn are in the same zone), it follows that Quinn is working in either Zone 1 or Zone 3. 

Now, we can eliminate any sales representative who is already in Zone 1 and Zone 3 from our list of potential sales representatives who can be in the same sales zone as Quinn:
  -We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra is not. If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao is not.
  -We don't know who is in Zone 3, but we do know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Quinn is not in Zone 2.

So, the only sales representative who could potentially work in the same sales zone as Quinn at this point is Mahr. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We are looking for a sales representative who cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  
Analysis:
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and either Parra or Tiao work in Zone 1, then Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
  Since Tiao or Udall work in Zone 2 and Quinn cannot work in Zone 1, then Quinn cannot work in Zone 2 with Tiao or Udall.
  It follows that Quinn must work in the same zone as Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, or in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  We're given a set of conditions:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  The question asks which one of the given sales representatives can't be in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  We know that Parra and Quinn, and Stuckey and Udall should be in the same zone based on the conditions.
  If Tiao is in Zone 1 and Udall is in Zone 2, it means there will be only one representative in Zone 1. Hence Kim or Mahr can be in Zone 1, but not both of them.
  Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we can have at most three representatives in Zone 2. Then at least four representatives will be in Zone 3.
  Let's start looking at which sales representative can't be in the same sales zone as Quinn:
  - Option A: There's no condition that prevents Kim from being in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  - Option B: There's no condition that prevents Mahr from being in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  - Option C: We know that Stuckey and Udall should be in the same zone, but it doesn't mean that Quinn can't be in the same zone as well. This option is a possible candidate.
  - Option D: This option is a no-go as we know that only one of either Parra and Tiao can be in Zone 1, and we don't have enough room for another representative in that zone.
  - Option E: This option is also a no-go as we know that only one of either Tiao and Udall can be in Zone 2, and we don't have enough room for another representative in that zone. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The total sales representatives are seven.
  Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 but not both.
  Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2 but not both.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  The number of sales representatives in Zone 3 is greater than the number of sales representatives in Zone 2.
  
Process of elimination: 
- From this, we can infer that Quinn is not working in a zone with Parra since they work in the same zone.
- Quinn could work in the same zone as Tiao, Udall, Mahr, Stuckey, or Kim but not with Parra.
- From the given conditions, Stuckey and Udall will also work in the same zone. Therefore, Quinn could not be working in the same zone as Stuckey or Udall.

Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
Choices:
  A: Julio, Nessa
  B: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca
  E: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Rebecca
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session cannot be on Wednesday.
  
Reasoning: 
  Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, that session must be on Thursday or Friday. 
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session cannot be on Wednesday. 
  Therefore, we know that Nessa's session is either the Thursday morning session or the Friday afternoon session. 
  We can have different possible scenarios for Kevin and Rebecca:
  1. Kevin's session is on Wednesday and Rebecca's on Thursday.
  2. Kevin's session is on Thursday and Rebecca's on Friday.
  3. Kevin's session is on Wednesday afternoon and Rebecca's is Thursday morning.
  We need to check which lab assistants can lead the Thursday afternoon session according to each scenario.

Action:
  Scenario 1: 
  If Kevin's session is on Wednesday, then Nessa's session cannot be the Thursday morning session, so Nessa's session must be the Friday afternoon session, and Rebecca's session must be the Thursday morning session. Then, the lab assistants available for Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Nessa. 
  Scenario 2: If Kevin's session is on Thursday, then Nessa's session cannot be on Thursday morning session. Therefore, Nessa's session must on Friday afternoon, and Rebecca's session must be on Wednesday. The lab assistants available for Thursday afternoon session are Julio, Lan, and Nessa. 
  Scenario 3: If Kevin's session is on Wednesday afternoon, then Rebecca's session cannot be on Wednesday morning. Therefore, Rebecca's session must be on Thursday and Nessa's on Friday afternoon. Since Julio's session must take place on an earlier day than Olivia's, and we already used Wednesday afternoon for Kevin's session, then Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning. The lab assistants available for Thursday afternoon session are Kevin and Rebecca.
  
Since Julio and Nessa are available in both scenarios, we can conclude that the complete and accurate list of lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session is (C) Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca. Therefore, the answer is (C).
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The lab sessions are scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Each day has two sessions—one each morning and one each afternoon.
  There are six lab assistants —Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca
  Kevin and Rebecca will lead sessions on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

Action: 
  We know that Kevin and Rebecca will lead sessions on the same day. So, if Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then it means that Nessa's session will be held on Friday afternoon. If Nessa will lead Friday afternoon session, then Lan and Olivia cannot lead Friday sessions. So, only Julio, Kevin, and Rebecca remain as the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session. Since only one assistant can lead a session, a complete and accurate list of all possible lab assistants who can lead the Thursday afternoon session would be:
Answer("C") Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

We don't have information about who is assigned to any of the specific sessions mentioned.
However, we do know two important things: 
1. Kevin and Rebecca have to be assigned to the same day, so if Kevin's session is before Nessa's session, then the only option for Nessa's session is the afternoon session that day.
2. If Julio's session has to be on an earlier day than Olivia's, since Olivia's session cannot be on the first day (since the afternoon session had to be Nessa's), then Olivia's session must be on the third day (Friday). Therefore, Julio's session must be on the second day (Thursday).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca must be in the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot be in the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must be on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  There are six lab sessions, one each morning and one each afternoon, over three days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Working out:
Since Kevin and Rebecca must be in the same day and Nessa must lead an afternoon session, then Nessa cannot be in the same day as Kevin and Rebecca's day. That means the only possible day for Nessa to lead her afternoon session is on Friday. Thus, Kevin and Rebecca must lead their sessions on Thursday, and since Julio's session must be on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Julio's session must be on Wednesday.
So, we know the schedule looks like this:
Wednesday: Julio leads a session
Thursday: Kevin and Rebecca each lead a different session
Friday: Nessa leads a session in the afternoon and Olivia leads the other session.
Since we need to identify a list of lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session, then we need to check who has not yet been scheduled to lead a session at that time but is available to do it. The only one available is Nessa.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - There are six lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca.
  - There are three days (Wednesday, Thursday and Friday) for six lab sessions (one session each morning and afternoon). 
  - To have only one valid solution, given that Kevin's session is before Nessa's, Rebecca must be the assistant for the other session on that day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. So, Nessa's session must be on a different day than Olivia's. Therefore, Nessa must lead the afternoon session on Thursday, and Olivia's must be on Friday.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, he leads a session on Wednesday morning.
  
Actions: 
  1. Based on the constraints, we can say that Kevin's session is on Thursday morning and Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon.
  2. Kevin and Rebecca's session are on the same day. Therefore, Rebecca's session must be on Thursday afternoon.
  3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Olivia's session is on Friday morning.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Julio's session is on Wednesday morning.
  
Therefore, the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio, Kevin, and Nessa. 
The complete and accurate list is: Choice (D) Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
   Wednesday: Morning - (?)   Afternoon - (?)
   Thursday: Morning - (?)  Afternoon - (Nessa)
   Friday: Morning - (?)  Afternoon - (?)

  1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. Therefore, they must lead sessions on either Thursday or Friday, since there must be separate lab assistants leading sessions on both the morning and afternoon of each day. 
  2. If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's session, this means that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Friday so that Nessa can lead an afternoon session on Thursday. Therefore, the Tuesday afternoon session must be led by either Julio or Olivia.
  3. Option A is not complete because it only lists Julio and Nessa, ignoring the constraint that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  4. Option B is not complete because it only lists Kevin and Rebecca, ignoring the constraint that an afternoon session must be led by Nessa. 
  5. Option C is complete because it lists all lab assistants who have not been excluded by the constraints: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day; Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day; Nessa must lead an afternoon session; and Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. 
  6. Option D is not complete because it includes Julio and Nessa but excludes Lan, who cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia.
  7. Option E is not complete because it includes all six lab assistants, ignoring the constraint that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
From the given information, we can infer that Kevin and Rebecca's sessions are held on Thursday, Friday, or Friday, Saturday. 

Scenario 1: If Kevin's session is held on Thursday, Nessa's session must be held on Friday, and Julio's session must be held on Wednesday. Therefore, from the given information, Lan and Olivia both must lead sessions on Wednesday, which contradicts Lan and Olivia being unable to lead sessions on the same day. Thus, Kevin's session is not held on Thursday.

Scenario 2: If Kevin's session is held on Friday, Nessa's session must be held on Friday since it has to be an afternoon session, and Julio's session must be held on Wednesday. Therefore, from the given information, Lan and Olivia both must lead sessions on Thursday, and both still can not lead a session on the same day. Thus, Kevin's session is not held on Friday.

Conclusion: There is no scenario where Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's session. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  - There are six lab assistants in total. 
  - There are only two sessions on Thursday - one in the morning and another in the afternoon.
  - There is no mention of a constraint on who can or cannot lead a session based on the day of the week.
  
Analysis: 
  - Since Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, Kevin will have a morning session on either Wednesday or Thursday, and Nessa will have an afternoon session on either Thursday or Friday. Therefore, the lab assistant who led the Wednesday afternoon session cannot be Nessa or Julio.
  - From the choices: 
    - (A) Julio cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session since he needs to lead a session earlier in the week than Olivia.
    - (B) Kevin and Rebecca already led a session on the same day, so only one of them can lead the Thursday afternoon session.
    - (C) This is a possibility, Nessa must lead an afternoon session (which may only be on Thursday or Friday), and Kevin already led a session in the morning.
    - (D) This is also a possibility - Kevin and Nessa are already selected, and Julio can lead the Thursday morning session, whereas Rebecca can lead the Friday morning session.
    - (E) Since it is mentioned that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, and there are only two sessions on Thursday, this option cannot be accurate.
  - So, options (C) and (D) could contain lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - 6 lab assistants: Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca.
  - 6 lab sessions, one session being held each morning and one each afternoon.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  We have the following schedule:

                 Wed        Thu         Fri
        Morning  Julio      Kevin       Lan
        Afternoon Rebecca   Nessa       Olivia
  
  According to the schedule, Thursday afternoon lab will be led by either Nessa or Rebecca. 
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's means that on Friday Kevin and Nessa will lead the morning sessions.
  Therefore, Olivia will lead the Friday afternoon lab session. 

  So the complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session is: 
  A: Julio, Nessa

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's session:
  - Kevin and Rebecca can lead the Thursday sessions.
  - Either Julio or Rebecca can lead the Wednesday sessions, depending on which of them is leading sessions on the earlier day of the week.
  - Either Julio or Rebecca can lead the Friday sessions.
  
  The lab assistants who have not been assigned yet are Julio, Lan, Nessa, and Olivia.
  
Analysis:
  Thursday afternoon session, Nessa must lead it. 
  The lab assistant who will lead the Wednesday session must lead sessions on an earlier day of the week. So, it is either Julio or Rebecca.
  Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on the same day. If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Rebecca's session will meet on the same day as Nessa's, hence Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  So, the only possible option is for Julio to lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  So, A is correct but it is incomplete because Julio also needs to be included in the list.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which one of the following is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform on either slot 1, 2 or 3, and Zircon must play on either slot 4, 5, or 6. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Therefore, Xpert plays in slot 6. Uneasy plays in one of the last three slots, and Vegemite plays after  Yardsign.
- Based on this information, it's not possible for Wellspring to play in slot 1 because that means Yardsign has to play in slot 2 or later, which is not possible. 
- It's also not possible for Wellspring to play in slot 2 because that means Yardsign would've played in slot 1, which would cause issues with the other bands.
- The earliest possible slot Wellspring could play is slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. The order must meet multiple constraints which are:
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  2. If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, there are only two possible orders for the bands which are:
    - V, W, Z, X, Y, U
    - V, W, Z, X, U, Y

Analysis:
  1. The question assumes that Zircon performs in slot two which means that Wellspring has to perform in Slot one.
  2. According to the constraints, Uneasy has to perform in one of the last three slots so slots four, five, and six are reserved for these three bands respectively.
  3. Yardsign has to perform in one of the first three slots, which leaves slots three and five for them.
  4. If Yardsign performs in slot three, then Xpert will perform in slot four. But we know that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, which means that this order is not valid.
  5. Thus, the earliest slot for Wellspring to perform is slot one.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
- If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, the only possible order of these two is Zircon then Yardsign.
- We can create a table to keep track of the allowed options as follows:

| Slot | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1st  | V | Y | Y |   |   | U |
| 2nd  |   | W | W | V | Y |   |
| 3rd  |   | Z | X | W | Z |   |

Action: Answer("B") 

If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then we know that Yardsign cannot perform in slots 1 or 2. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot 3, and Wellspring must perform before Yardsign. The only possible slots for Wellspring with this condition are slots 2 and 3, but if Wellspring performs in slot 2, then there will be no available slots that fit the Xpert constraint. Therefore, the earliest slot that Wellspring could perform in is slot 3.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands - Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon will perform.
  - The performance order must meet the following constraints: 
    - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, it means that Zircon will either perform in slot one or slot two and Yardsign will perform in slot three.
  - In this scenario, Wellspring cannot perform in slot two because Zircon must perform earlier than Wellspring.
  - Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform would be slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are six slots numbered one through six, with six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) that will perform in just one slot.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  We need to identify the slot number for Wellspring based on the given constraints.

Solution:
  We can start by using the constraint that "Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots". This means that Zircon must perform in one of the last three slots. 
  The constraint "Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon" tells us that Vegemite must perform in slot 1 or 2, and Zircon must perform in slot 3, 4, or 5.
  From "Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert", we know that Xpert cannot perform earlier than slot 4, so Zircon must be in slot 3 or 4. This means that Wellspring must be in slot 2, 3, or 4.
  Lastly, from "Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots", we know that Uneasy must be in slot 4, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, Wellspring could perform in the earliest slot of two.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. In the order, Vegemite performs before Zircon
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform before Xpert
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  5. Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  
Reasoning: Since Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, the order would be something like this: Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Yardsign, Uneasy. 
Wellspring could not perform in slot 2 because Yardsign has to perform in one of the first three slots. Wellspring could not perform in slot 3 because Zircon has to perform before Xpert. Therefore, the earliest slot Wellspring could perform is slot 4.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: This is a sequencing problem that requires considering multiple constraints.
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  3. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  4. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
Assumption: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, Wellspring cannot perform in slot 1 since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

Analysis: 
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, this means that Zircon must occupy slot 1, 2, or 3 and Yardsign must occupy slot 2 or 3.
  Since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, Wellspring cannot occupy slot 6.
  If Zircon is in slot 1, then Wellspring can be in slot 2 because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Zircon is in slot 2, then Wellspring can be in slot 3 because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Zircon is in slot 3, then Wellspring can be in slot 4 because slot 1 and 2 will be occupied by Zircon and Yardsign respectively and Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Xpert and Zircon.
  3. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  4. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  5. There are six slots: slot 1 through slot 6 and six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  
To answer the question, we need to consider the constraints applied to the slot allocation.
If we assume Zircon plays in slot 2 (or 1). Therefore:
- Vegemite has to be in slot 1 (or 2).
- Wellspring has to be in slot 3. Because both Zircon and Xpert need to perform in earlier slots than Wellspring.
- Yardsign has to be in slot 2 (or any other slot because Yardsign's slot has no effect on Wellspring's slot).
- Uneasy has to be in slot 4, 5 or 6 as it needs to perform in one of the last three slots.
Which brings us to the answer:
Action: Answer("B") i.e., Wellspring could perform in slot three.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Vegemite must perform before Zircon.
- Both Wellspring and Zircon must perform before Xpert.
- Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
- Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.

If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign has to perform on slot 3. This is because if Yardsign performs in slot 2 or 1, then there is no slot available for Zircon to perform earlier than Yardsign, which contradicts the initial assumption. Therefore, we can deduce that the order of the first three slots is:
1. [empty]
2. [empty]
3. Yardsign

Also, if Uneasy performs in slot 4, slot 5, or slot 6, we still need to fit in the slots for Vagamite, Wellspring, Xpert, and Zircon earlier. Together with Yardsign in slot 3, we have:

1. Vegemite
2. [empty]
3. Yardsign
4. Zircon
5. Wellspring or Xpert
6. The other between Wellspring and Xpert
Note that Uneasy is still not included in the valid order of the bands.

Now, if Wellspring performs on slot 5 or later, then there will be no slot available for Uneasy, which contradicts the initial constraint where Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots. Therefore we can deduce that the earliest slot Wellspring can perform is slot 4.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We must order 6 bands in 6 different slots.
  Vegemite must be before Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon must be before Xpert.
  Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
  We need to find the earliest slot where Wellspring can perform if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.

Approach:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  Also, Xpert cannot occupy slot 6 since Wellspring and Zircon are before Xpert and Xpert cannot be in slot 6.
  Therefore, Xpert must be in slot 4.
  Since Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, then there are only two possibilities: Uneasy in slot 4 and Wellspring in slot 5 or Uneasy in slot 5 and Wellspring in slot 4.
  Split testing both possible scenarios we can see that if Uneasy performs in slot 5, then the earliest slot Wellspring can perform is slot 4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  We don't know the exact positions of Tao, Stanton, and Rovero, except that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  There are total seven accomplices.
  
If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then either Rovero is recruited later than Quinn or Quinn was recruited last. Either way, it means that Stanton was not recruited last. As we don't know the exact positions of Tao, Rovero, and Stanton, Stanton might have been recruited either first, second, third, fifth, or seventh. Thus, Stanton CAN be recruited as the first, second, third, fifth, or seventh accomplice even if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero and Peters was recruited fourth, implying that Quinn is not the fourth accomplice;
- If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then we have Quinn, Rovero in that order;
- Villas was recruited immediately before White, meaning we have a chain: ..., Villas, White;
- From the information given, the detective has not established a fixed position for Tao and Stanton yet.

If we have Quinn, Rovero in that order, then Peters has to be the accomplice before Quinn. We have Peters, Quinn, Rovero in that order. We now have a chain: ...Peters, Quinn, Rovero, ... If Stanton was recruited right after Tao, it will be in the sequence Tao, Stanton. But Stanton cannot occupy the third position in the sequence  Peters, Quinn, Rovero, ... because then he would be recruited immediately after Tao. Therefore, Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Peters was recruited fourth.
  5. There are 7 accomplices in total.

To find out if Stanton can or cannot have been recruited, let's see how many positions are before and after the position(s) Rovero can be recruited in, given that Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero.

If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, there are two possible scenarios:
- Quinn was recruited second and Rovero was recruited third.
- Quinn was recruited third and Rovero was recruited fourth.

In both scenarios, there are positions before and after the position(s) Rovero can be recruited in, where Stanton could still have been recruited in, as there are at least two positions before and at least two positions after. Therefore, Stanton CAN still have been recruited.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  - There are a total of seven individuals recruited as accomplices.

If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment can be arranged as follows:
1. Peters
2. Villas
3. White
4. Quinn
5. Rovero
This leaves two spots for Tao and Stanton. According to the given information, Stanton neither comes immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Therefore, there are two possible arrangements for Tao and Stanton:
6. Tao
7. Stanton

OR

6. Stanton
7. Tao

Therefore, Stanton can be recruited either fifth or seventh.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn and Rovero must have been recruited either 2nd and 3rd or 3rd and 2nd, in that order.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so they were recruited 6th and 7th, in that order.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so they must have been recruited either 1st, 2nd, 5th, or 6th.
  
Analysis: 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited 2nd and Rovero must have been recruited 3rd. If this is the case, then Stanton must have been recruited either 1st, 5th, or 6th. None of these possibilities contradicts the information that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then it is possible that Stanton was recruited, so we cannot say that Stanton CANNOT have been recruited.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  1. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must be recruited either second, third, or fourth. Villas must be sixth and White must be seventh to satisfy the Vilas-White requirement. So, Stanton would have to be recruited either first, fifth or in the slot immediately after Tao.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  There are seven people in total.
  
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn cannot be the first person since they would need to be at least two before Rovero.
  
Analysis:
  If Stanton was the first two recruited, then there are only five remaining people to recruit from. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, meaning Stanton must be either the first or last to be recruited of the remaining five people. If Quinn is immediately before Rovero, then Peters and Villas must be recruited before Quinn. Since Peters was recruited fourth and Villas goes before White, then Villas must be recruited fifth which means White must be the last one recruited. Therefore, Stanton must be either the first or sixth, but not the fifth to be recruited. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.

If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn cannot be the first person recruited. Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn is not the first to be recruited. This also means Peters was not recruited immediately before or after Quinn.

Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, this means Stanton cannot be the second or third person recruited, since Qin was recruited earlier than Rovero. If Stanton was not the fourth person recruited, then the only possibilities left are fifth and seventh.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then this establishes the order of the three recruits as Quinn, Rovero, in that specific order. It also follows that Peters was recruited before the Quinn-Rovero duo because he was recruited fourth and they were not recruited in consecutive order (i.e., one after the other). Villas was recruited immediately before White. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
If we assume that Stanton was recruited after Tao, that implies at least three people have been recruited (Tao, Peters, and at least one more person) before Stanton. We cannot conclude whether Stanton was recruited before or after White. But if we assume that Stanton was recruited before Tao, then he could have been first, second, or third. Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, we cannot infer whether Stanton was recruited or not.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton would have to be recruited either third or fifth, based on Peters being recruited in fourth place.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are six members in the band, and each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist or trumpeter, but not both.

Analysis:
  Assume that the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, this means that the percussionist cannot be the sixth soloist, and the saxophonist cannot be the first soloist. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform either the third or sixth solo.
  
  If C is true, it means the violinist performs before the saxophonist, who performs third, which contradicts that the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist or the trumpeter. Therefore C is not true.
  
  If D is true, it means the percussionist performs before the fourth solo, which contradicts the information that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore D is not true.
  
  If E is true, it means the saxophonist performs after the keyboard player, which contradicts the information that the keyboard player performs a solo before the saxophonist. Therefore, E is not true.

Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  The percussionist performs before the saxophonist, and the saxophonist should perform at either the third or sixth solo. The only way to fit the conditions is if the percussionist performs the first or second solo. If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo, and this contradicts the condition that the saxophonist performs after the percussionist or trumpeter. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the second solo. Hence, B is true.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  It's a sequencing problem, where we have to identify the sequence of six solos performed by the band members (one by each) given some constraints.
  The constraints are:
    1. Guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    2. Percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
    3. Keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
    4. Saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter or both. 

Action: Answer("D")
Reasoning: 
  Let's try to identify some inferences from the given constraints:
   - From constraint #1, it's clear that the guitarist performs either the first, second, or third solo.
   - From constraint #2, we know that the percussionist performs either the first, second, third solo. In other words, the percussionist does not perform the last solo.
   - From constraint #3, the keyboard player performs either the second, third, or fourth solo. Also, as per the given hint, the violinist performs before the keyboard player. Hence, the violinist must perform either the first or the second solo.
   - From constraint #4, the saxophonist performs either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo. Also, the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter but not both. Hence, let's consider two cases based on which member performs before the saxophonist: 
      - Case 1: The percussionist performs before the saxophonist.
      - Case 2: The trumpeter performs before the saxophonist.
  
  Let's start with Case 1:
   - As per the hint in constraint #2, the percussionist performs either the first, second, or third solo. Hence, the percussionist must either perform the first or the second solo.
   - If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the violinist must perform the second solo. Since the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, and the keyboard player performs before the guitarist, the only option left for the keyboard player is the third solo. This leaves the saxophonist with two possible options - fourth or sixth. As per constraint #4, the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist. Hence, the only option left for the saxophonist is performing the fourth solo.
   - Hence, the sequence becomes: Percussionist (1), Violinist (2), Keyboard player (3), Saxophonist (4), Guitarist (5), Trumpeter (6).
   
   - If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the violinist must perform the first solo. Similar to the previous case, this leaves the keyboard player with only one option, i.e., the third solo, and the saxophonist with two options - fourth and sixth. If the saxophonist performs the fourth solo, then the only option left for the guitarist is the fifth solo, making the trumpeter the last one to perform, which violates the constraint that the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Hence, the saxophonist must perform the sixth solo, and the guitarist must perform the fifth solo. The sequence becomes: Violinist (1), Percussionist (2), Keyboard player (3), Trumpeter (4), Guitarist (5), Saxophonist (6). 

  Let's move to Case 2:
   - If the trumpeter performs before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist must perform either the fourth, fifth, or sixth solo. Let's consider each of these cases:
     - Case 2.1: If saxophonist performs the fourth solo, then the guitarist must perform the fifth solo, leaving the keyboard player with the only option of the last solo. The percussionist must perform either the first or second solo, and the violinist must perform the remaining solo, which violates the hint that the violinist must perform before the keyboard player. Hence, this case is invalid.
     - Case 2.2: If saxophonist performs the fifth solo, then the guitarist must perform the fourth solo, leaving the keyboard player with two possible options - third or last. In any case, there is no way to fit the percussionist, the violinist, and the trumpeter in the remaining slots such that they satisfy all of the given constraints. Hence, this case is also invalid.
     - Case 2.3: If saxophonist performs the sixth solo, then the guitarist must perform the fourth solo, and the keyboard player must perform the third solo. The percussionist must perform either the first or the second solo, and the violinist must perform the remaining one. The sequence, in this case, becomes: Percussionist (1), Violinist (2), Keyboard player (3), Guitarist (4), Trumpeter (5), Saxophonist (6).
   
   - Hence, based on the above analysis, we can conclude that if the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does. Answer("D").
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are six members in the band, and each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The restrictions are:
  1. The guitarist will not perform the fourth solo.
  2. The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  3. The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  4. The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or trumpeter but not both.

There are two cases:
Case1: percussionist performs before the trumpeter.
In this case, the saxophonist will perform after the trumpeter, so the percussionist will not perform the last solo (because the saxophonist will perform at that time). Then, the order that satisfies all the restrictions is:
V, P, T, S, K, G
Therefore, the violinist performs a solo before the saxophonist does. So, (C) "The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does" is true.

Case2: percussionist performs after the trumpeter.
In this case, the saxophonist will perform after the percussionist, so the percussionist will not perform the last solo. Then, the order that satisfies all the restrictions is:
V, T, P, S, K, G
Therefore, the violinist performs a solo before the saxophonist does. So, (C) "The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does" is true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - There are six members in the band, each performing exactly one solo.
  - Restrictions:
    - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
    - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
    - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Explanation: 
  If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist performs at either the fifth or sixth solo. Thus, the violinist must perform at some time before the saxophonist does, meaning that C is a true statement. A and B are not true statements because neither is a definite position that the percussionist must play in. D is not necessarily true because it is possible that the percussionist plays after the trumpeter. E is not true because the saxophonist must perform after the percussionist or the trumpeter.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. Six solos must be performed exactly once by each band member.
  2. Guitarist cannot perform the solo number 4.
  3. Percussionist performs before the keyboard player does.
  4. Keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  5. Saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

We know that Percussionist performs before the Saxophonist.
If Percussionist performs the first solo then Saxophonist will have to perform the last solo, but we know that no band member performs the same number of solos as any other band member.
So, Percussionist cannot perform the first solo. Therefore, the percussionist must perform the second or third solo. 

Option A and E could be eliminated as the Percussionist cannot perform the first solo or after the keyboard player.

Option D could also be eliminated as the Saxophonist cannot perform a solo after the trumpeter.

Option C is also not necessarily true as we do not know if the violinist or the saxophonist performs first.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six band members: guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist.
  Each band member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  Restrictions:
    - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player.
    - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist and before the guitarist.
    - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.

Action: Answer("D") 

If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then we know that:
- The percussionist's solo must occur before the saxophonist's solo.
- The saxophonist's solo must occur later in time than the percussionist's solo or the trumpeter's solo.
We know that the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, and so the order of the solos must be percussionist - violinist - (trumpeter or percussionist) - saxophonist - keyboard player - guitarist.
Since we are told that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, then the order must be percussionist - violinist - trumpeter - saxophonist - keyboard player - guitarist. Therefore, the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does (D).
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - A six-member band is performing. Each member performs one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
  - If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist, the saxophonist's solo must either come last or be preceded only by the trumpeter's solo.
  - If the saxophonist's solo comes last, then the percussionist must perform before the saxophonist (contradiction).
  - Therefore, the saxophonist’s solo must be preceded only by the trumpeter’s solo.
  - Therefore, percussionist performs before the trumpeter solo indicating that D is correct.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Each band member performs exactly one solo.
  2. The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  3. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  4. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  5. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does but not both.

Action: Answer("D")

If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does:
  -If the percussionist performs the first solo, the saxophonist must perform at least the fourth solo and violate the restriction that guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  -If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist should perform after the trumpeter and violate the given condition that saxophonist performs after any one, but not both, of the percussionist and trumpeter. Hence, this cannot be true.
  -The order becomes as follows: Percussionist, ___ , saxophonist.
  -The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Let's add this to the sequence order so far: Percussionist, Violinist, Keyboard player, __, Saxophonist.
  -The guitarist is the only one left who didn't perform yet. So, he performs last.
  -The violinist performs before the saxophonist. Therefore, the violinist performs before the saxophonist. Hence, the only option that must be true is D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 members: 1) guitarist, 2) keyboard player, 3) percussionist, 4) saxophonist, 5) trumpeter, and 6) violinist.
  - Each member must perform exactly one solo.
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player.
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  
Analysis: 
  - If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, it means that the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist does.
  - However, we do not know the exact position of the percussionist and saxophonist.
  - The choices can help us eliminate some possible positions of these two musicians.
  - Choice A is impossible because the guitarist doesn't perform the fourth solo.
  - Choice B is impossible because the saxophonist performs after the percussionist, so the percussionist cannot perform the second solo because the saxophonist performs after the trumpeter.
  - Choice C is possible because we don't have any restrictions on the position of the violinist.
  - Choice D is impossible because we know that the percussionist performs before the keyboard player and the keyboard player performs before the guitarist. So the percussionist will perform before the trumpeter.
  - Choice E is impossible because the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist or the trumpeter.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Each member performs exactly one solo.
  - Restrictions:
    - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
    - The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
    - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
    - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

To logically deduce one conclusion, we could break down the restrictions as follows:
- Guitarist not on the 4th solo. Possible slot: {1,2,3,5,6}
- Percussionist before keyboard. Possible slot for percussionist: {1,2,3}.
- Keyboard after violinist and before guitarist. Possible slot for Keyboard: {4,5}.
- Saxophonist after either the percussionist or the trumpeter but not both. Possible slot for the saxophonist: {3,4,5,6}.

From the above breakdown, we can infer that the percussionist performs in any of the first three slots (1,2,3). Hence, the saxophonist can perform in any slot between 3-6.
Now, Assume the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does. Hence, saxophonist can only perform in slot 4,5, or 6. This narrows the possible slots for the other members:
- Guitarist is left with slot 1 or 2 (since he never performs the 4th solo).
- Keyboard player is left with slot 5 (since keyboard must perform after violinist and before guitarist).
- The violinist performs solo either on the first or second slot depending on whether the guitarist performs on the first or second slot.
- The remaining slot is reserved for the trumpet player.

From the above deduction, only option C is true:
C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A naturalist will give five lectures, each on a different type of bird: oystercatchers, petrels, rails, sandpipers, or terns. The lectures must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium, in an order that meets the following conditions: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  - The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: If the third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall, then there would be four lectures in Gladwyn Hall and only one lecture in Howard Auditorium. However, it is given that exactly three lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, which contradicts this statement. Therefore, E must be false.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  - The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. 
  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. 
  - The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. 
  - The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

To have exactly three in Gladwyn Hall and one of them being the first lecture, this means that the second and third lectures must both be in Howard Auditorium. This also makes choices B, D, and E true. 

Knowledge: 
  - The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Petrels is in Gladwyn Hall, so that means the lecture on terns must be earlier than the lecture on petrels and cannot be both in Gladwyn Hall either. This makes choice C false.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. 
  The naturalist will give lectures on five different types of birds: oystercatchers, petrels, rails, sandpipers, or terns.
  Exactly 3 lectures will take place in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is earlier than the lecture on petrels, and the lecture on petrels will be at Gladwyn Hall.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If both the first and second lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, then the lecture on sandpipers cannot be in Howard Auditorium (since it must be earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers). However, it must be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, this must be false.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  * First lecture is in Gladwyn Hall 
  * Fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium
  * Three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall and two are in Howard Auditorium
  * Lecture on sandpipers --> Howard Auditorium
  * Lecture on oystercatchers --> After the lecture on sandpipers
  * Lecture on terns --> Before the lecture on petrels
  * Lecture on petrels --> Gladwyn Hall
  * Only five lectures
  * Lecture sequence: G, _, _, H, _
  
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
    * First lecture is in Gladwyn Hall
    * Second lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall because only three lectures are allowed to be in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium
    * Fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium --> Fourth lecture cannot be both in Howard Auditorium and also after a hypothetical third lecture in Howard Auditorium.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
    * First lecture is in Gladwyn Hall --> Second lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall because only three lectures are allowed to be in Gladwyn Hall.
    * Lecture on petrels must be in Gladwyn Hall --> Lecture on terns must be earlier than lecture on petrels --> Lecture on terns cannot be in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
    * Fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium --> Third lecture cannot also be in Howard Auditorium because only five lectures are available.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
    * First lecture is in Gladwyn Hall --> Third lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall because only three lectures are allowed to be in Gladwyn Hall.
    * Lecture on terns must be earlier than lecture on petrels --> Lecture on terns cannot be the fifth lecture.
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Checking the choices:
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. Possible, as long as one of the remaining lectures is also in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. Possible, but none of these lectures can be the fourth lecture.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. Not possible, since the lecture on oystercatchers must be after the lecture on sandpipers and the lecture on petrels must be after the lecture on terns.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. Possible, as long as one of the remaining lectures is also in Howard Auditorium.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. Not possible, since exactly three of the lectures must be in Gladwyn Hall.

Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
- Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
- The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
- The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

Analysis:
- If the first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall, we violate the condition that the fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium. Therefore, A cannot be true.
- If the second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium, we violate the condition that exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, B cannot be true.
- If the second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall, we violate the condition that the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. Therefore, C cannot be true.
- If the third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium, we violate the condition that the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, D cannot be true.
- If the third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall, we violate the condition that the lecture on sandpipers is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - The order of the lectures is: Gladwyn, X, Y, Howard, Z.
  - Three lectures are in Gladwyn and two are in Howard.
  - Sandpipers are in Howard and earlier than oystercatchers.
  - Terns are earlier than petrels, which are in Gladwyn.
  
Analysis:
Let's consider each statement:
  - A: It's possible for the first and second lectures to be in Gladwyn Hall. For example: Gladwyn (oystercatchers), Howard (petrels), Gladwyn (terns), Howard (rails), Gladwyn (sandpipers). Statement A does not have to be false.
  - B: It's not possible for the second and third lectures to be in Howard Auditorium, since the fourth lecture must be in Howard, and only two lectures are in Howard. Statement B must be false.
  - C: It's not possible for the second and fifth lectures to be in Gladwyn Hall. If the second lecture is in Gladwyn, then the third can't be in Gladwyn since only three lectures may be held there. Moreover, the fifth lecture must be held in Howard, so the fourth lecture will be about oystercatchers held in Gladwyn Hall (since sandpipers are in Howard and earlier than oystercatchers), leaving no room for another lecture in Gladwyn. Statement C does not have to be false.
  - D: It's possible for the third and fourth lectures to be both in Howard Auditorium. For example: Gladwyn (rails), Howard (oystercatchers), Gladwyn (petrels), Howard (terns), Gladwyn (sandpipers). Statement D does not have to be false.
  - E: It's not possible for the third and fifth lectures to be both in Gladwyn Hall. If the fifth lecture is in Gladwyn (since the fourth is in Howard), then the second lecture must also be held in Gladwyn, which is impossible since only three lectures may held be there. Therefore, the third lecture should be held in Gladwyn, followed by the fifth lecture in Howard. The order of the lectures could be: Gladwyn (sandpipers), Howard (oystercatchers), Gladwyn (rails), Howard (terns), Gladwyn (petrels). Statement E does not have to be false.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. The first lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium.
  2. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, two lectures will be held in Howard Auditorium.
  3. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  4. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.

A: The first lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall, so this statement is true. It is possible that the second lecture is also in Gladwyn Hall, so this statement is not necessarily false. 
B: The fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium, so this statement is false. Both the second and third lectures cannot be in the same location. 
C: The third lecture must be in Howard Auditorium, so this statement is false. The fifth lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall, so it is not possible for both the second and fifth lectures to be in Gladwyn Hall. 
D: The fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium, so this statement is true. It is possible that the third lecture is also in Howard Auditorium, so this statement is not necessarily false. 
E: The third lecture must be in Howard Auditorium, so this statement is false. The fifth lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall, so it is not possible for both the third and fifth lectures to be in Gladwyn Hall.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The order of the lectures must be: Gladwyn, x, x, Howard, x, where x could be one of the three possible lectures for each slot: sandpipers/oystercatchers, petrels/terns, and rails. Since Gladwyn Hall is used for exactly three lectures, all possible arrangements should be considered.

A: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, so the second lecture could be petrels, rails, or terns, but none of these could be in Gladwyn Hall, so this statement is true.
B: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so there are only two possible lectures for the third slot, rails or a Gladwyn Hall lecture. But the latter contradicts with the condition that only three of the lectures are held in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the third lecture must be rails, which means this statement is true.
C: The last lecture must be oystercatchers, so we have two options for the second lecture: terns or petrels. If the second lecture is petrels, then the last condition is violated because petrels lecture should be in Gladwyn Hall, but Gladwyn Hall is already reserved for three lectures. Therefore, the second lecture must be terns, making this statement true.
D: Since the third lecture is rails, and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, the only allowed lecture for the fifth slot is oystercatchers, so this statement is true.
E: The rails lecture must be in the third slot, so there are two remaining Gladwyn Hall slots left for oystercatchers and petrels. But the order requirement indicates that the terns lecture should be earlier than the petrels lecture, but both are planned for Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the statement is false.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - First and fourth lectures are given in each of Gladwyn Hall and Howard Auditorium.
  - exactly 3 of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  - sandpipers must be before oystercatchers and sandpipers are in Howard Auditorium.
  - terns must be before petrels and petrels are in Gladwyn Hall.
  
Option analysis:
  A. The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, so the second lecture could be in Howard Auditorium. This statement could be true, not necessarily false.
  B. The fourth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium, so the third lecture could be given either in Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium. This statement could also be true, not necessarily false.
  C. From the rules, at least the lecture on sandpipers and terns must be in Howard Auditorium, so neither of them could be in Gladwyn Hall. According to this option, they are both in Gladwyn Hall which contradicts the rule. Thus, it must be false.
  D. The fourth lecture is given in Howard Auditorium, so the third lecture could be given either in Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium. This statement could be true.
  E. There are exactly 3 lectures in Gladwyn Hall, which are not oystercatchers or terns. Since the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium, the only remaining lecture for Gladwyn Hall is rails. Thus, this statement is also true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Each wall has exactly 2 paintings. 
  - Two paintings on each wall are in the upper and lower positions. 
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  - Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
Processing:
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2 and no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, Hidalgo must have another painting displayed with his oil on Wall 2. This means Wall 2 has two paintings displayed on it. Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, one of the two paintings on Wall 2 must be an oil painting. Therefore, the best answer is (A) Franz's oil painting.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we can infer that:
  - Franz's and Isaacs's works are not on wall 2
  - Greene's work is not positioned in the lower spot on wall 2
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each wall, one in the upper position and one in the lower position
  
  A: If Franz's oil is displayed on another wall, then a watercolor must be in the upper position on wall 2. However, given the constraint that no walls have only watercolors, this cannot be the case, so this option is not possible.
  B: If Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then his oil must be on either wall 1 or 3 in the upper position. However, given the constraint that no wall has only watercolors, this is not possible because a watercolor must be in the lower position on that wall to display both of Greene's works. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  C: If Greene's oil is displayed on wall 2, then his watercolor must be on either wall 1 or 3 in the lower position. This satisfies the conditions, so this option is possible.
  D: Since Hidalgo's oil is already on wall 2, we know that his watercolor must be on another wall. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then his oil must be on another wall. This would mean that the painting by Hidalgo on wall 2 would have to be a watercolor, which violates the conditions, so this option is not possible.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  3. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  5. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  6. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
  Based on the above information, the following must be true:
  - Wall 1 cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor.
  - Wall 3 cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor.
  - Wall 4 cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor or watercolor by any other artist because Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, which means its upper position must be another oil painting.
  - Wall 4 cannot have Franz's oil or Isaacs's watercolor due to condition #3, which states that no wall may have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
  Explanation: 
  Since no wall can have just watercolors and no wall can have a painting by only one artist, Hidalgo's other painting must be displayed with the painting of either Greene or Isaacs. Condition #4 tells us that Greene's painting (an oil) is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, which can only be wall 1 or 2. We know Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, so we have two possible configurations for wall 2: (1) Hidalgo's oil in the lower position, with Greene's oil in the upper position, and (2) Greene's watercolor in the upper position, with Hidalgo's watercolor in the lower position. However, in (2), there would be no place for Isaacs's watercolor since wall 4 cannot have a watercolor in the upper position due to condition #5. Therefore, the only possibility is configuration (1), which means Greene's oil painting is also displayed on wall 2. So, the answer is (C) Greene's oil.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs) will display their two paintings each in an exhibition with a total of 8 paintings.
  - 2 Paintings will be displayed on each of the 4 walls with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No Wall can have only watercolors on it.
  - No Wall can have only one students' painting(s) on it.
  - No Wall can have both Franz's and Isaacs's painting(s) displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor will be displayed in the upper position on the same Wall as Franz's oil.
  - Isaacs's oil will be displayed in the lower position of Wall 4.

Explanation:
  - If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then one of Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on that wall, which means, the other painting on wall 2 must belong to one of the remaining two artists (Franz and Greene).
  - Greene's Watercolor will be displayed on the same Wall as Franz's oil, which means Franz's oil cannot be displayed on Wall 2.
  - Isaacs's oil will be displayed on the lower position of Wall 4 which cannot be Wall 2.
  - Therefore, the only possible answer can be Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Four students are displaying exactly 2 paintings each, an oil and a watercolor, so there are a total of 8 paintings at the exhibition.
  - No wall can have only watercolors.
  - No wall has only one student's paintings.
  - No wall has paintings from both Franz and Isaacs.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  - Isaacs's oil is on the lower position of wall 4.

To determine the answer, we can use the information we have and do some deductions:
  - Hidalgo's oil is on wall 2, so Hidalgo's other painting (watercolor) cannot be on wall 2, since no wall can have only watercolors displayed.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be on a different wall than wall 2.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil. So, if Franz's oil is on wall 2, Greene's watercolor must also be on wall 2. If Franz's oil is not on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 2.
  - Isaacs's oil is on the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be on a different wall than wall 2.
  - Wall 2 has already been determined to have Hidalgo's oil, so it cannot have Hidalgo's watercolor, Isaacs's watercolor, or Franz's oil (because then both of Franz's paintings would be on the same wall).
  
From the above deductions, we can see that Greene's watercolor could also be displayed on wall 2. Therefore, the answer is A: Greene's watercolor. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The exhibition room has four walls.
  Each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  Each student displays exactly one oil and one watercolor.
  If the wall has an oil painting, it also has a watercolor painting.
  Each wall has paintings from at least two students.
  Franz and Isaacs cannot be in the same wall.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall with Franz's oil.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
 
Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: 
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which is opposite of wall 4 where Isaacs's oil is displayed, therefore neither Isaacs nor Franz can display their oil painting on wall 2. Since Greene displays a watercolor in the upper position of the wall with with Franz's oil, and Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, it is possible that the only remaining watercolor (Greene's watercolor) could be displayed in the lower position room 2. Thus, Isaacs's watercolor could be displayed in the upper position of wall 2. Hence, the answer is E.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  2. Each student has exactly one oil and one watercolor painting.
  3. There are four walls designated as Walls 1-4.
  4. Each wall contains exactly two paintings— one oil and one watercolor.
  5. Exactly one painting is displayed in the upper position of the wall and one painting is displayed in the lower position of the wall.
  6. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  7. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  8. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  9. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
 10. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Reasoning: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we know that the other painting on wall 2 must be a watercolor. We can use the given conditions to determine which paintings could possibly be displayed as a watercolor on wall 2. We know that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Additionally, we know that Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor are on the same wall. Therefore, if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then it cannot be possible for Franz's oil or Greene's watercolor to be displayed as a watercolor on wall 2. However, there are still three other students and paintings to consider - Hidalgo's own watercolor, Greene's oil, and Isaacs's watercolor.

Action: Answer("D") - Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each wall has exactly two paintings, one oil, and one watercolor. 
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  7. Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  
From condition 2, the wall 2 must have at least one oil painting. So there would be two paintings on wall 2 one oil and one watercolor.

From condition 5., where Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, we know that if Franz's oil is displayed on some wall, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall in the upper position. As Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 since wall 2 has an oil painting and no wall has only watercolors, so Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2.

From condition 4., no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. As Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, the condition mentioned in option D "Hidalgo's watercolor" cannot be displayed on wall 2, because displaying Hidalgo's watercolor would require one more painting from the same artist Hidalgo, and it would violate condition 3.

From condition 6, Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, which means that Isaacs' watercolor must be displayed on some other wall.

Now, we know Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2. Then we must have Hidalgo's watercolor on some other wall. Also, we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, meaning that Isaacs's watercolor will not be displayed on wall 4. So, we can have Isaacs's watercolor on wall 2 and the only remaining option that can be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Each of the walls (1, 2, 3 and 4) has exactly two paintings (an oil and watercolor) on it, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  3. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  5. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  6. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then:
  - Neither of Hidalgo's paintings can be on wall 1 or wall 3.
  - No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs.
  - Greene's oil must be on wall 1 or wall 3 (because it would be paired with Franz's watercolor or Isaacs's watercolor).
  - Greene's watercolor must be on wall 4 (because it must be placed with Franz's oil).
  - Isaacs's watercolor must be on wall 2 because it cannot be placed on wall 1 (because of Greene's oil), wall 3 (because of Franz's oil) or wall 4 (because of Isaacs's oil).
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be on wall 3.

Options:
  A: Franz's oil cannot be placed on wall 2 because it cannot be placed with Hidalgo's oil.
  B: Greene's watercolor cannot be placed on wall 2 because it is paired with Franz's oil on wall 1 or 3.
  C: Greene's oil cannot be placed on wall 2 because it is paired with Hidalgo's watercolor on wall 3.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor can be placed on wall 3 (as explained above), so it cannot be placed on wall 2.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is already placed on wall 2 (as explained above), so it cannot be placed on wall 2.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
 Following the given conditions:
 - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
 - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
 - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
 - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
 - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
 - If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then wall 1 and 3 must have oil paintings in the upper position in order to meet the condition "No wall has only watercolours displayed on it."
Option Analysis:
  A: Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 with Hidalgo's oil because the condition "No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it" is violated.
  B: Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, it cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  C: There are no restrictions against having Greene's oil on wall 2. Therefore, option C is a possible combination.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 as there must be an oil painting in the upper position of wall 2 to satisfy the first condition.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 as Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel.
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

To consider the options:
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel: This could be true since the bay holding produce, which is higher than the bay holding fuel, is not specifically mentioned to be in bay 1.
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce: This could NOT be true because the bay holding produce is mentioned to be next to the bay holding textiles which means it has an odd bay number, and all even-numbered bays hold cargoes other than produce or textiles.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles: This could be true according to the given information since Bay 4 might hold textiles whose neighboring bay is the bay holding produce.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain: This could be true since the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, assuming the bay holding livestock is in bay 4, bay 5 could be holding grain.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery: This could be true since the location and the types of the cargoes in the other bays do not exclude the possibility of bay 5 holding machinery.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  - There are exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

For each option:
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. It is possible that Bay 2 is holding fuel, and it doesn't conflict with any of the given conditions.
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce. It is not possible because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and none of the bays with a higher number than the bay holding livestock is 4.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles. It is possible because it's in line with the condition that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain. It is not possible because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and none of the bays with a higher number than the bay holding livestock is 5.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery. It is possible, it doesn't conflict with any of the given conditions.

The correct answer is B: Bay 4 is holding produce. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The dock consists of six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively.
  - There are six types of cargo which are fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Answer Analysis:
If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then it implies that the bay holding livestock must either be bay number 3 or 4. Based on the given information, the bay holding textiles must be beside the bay holding produce. Therefore, Bay 3 must hold livestock since it's the only location adjacent to textiles. The only condition that is not possible is if Bay 4 is holding grain following the condition that the bay holding livestock has to have a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Hence, the answer is (D) Bay 5 is holding grain. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The bay holding grain > the bay holding livestock
  - The bay holding livestock > the bay holding textiles
  - The bay holding produce > the bay holding fuel
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce
  - There are six bays and six types of cargo - one type for each bay.
  
Analysis: 
  - If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bays can be numbered in the following order: [Livestock, Produce, Textiles]. This means that Grain should be in one of the first three bays (1, 2, 3) and Fuel in one of the last two bays (4, 5). 
  - We can eliminate A because if Fuel is in bay 2, then bay 1 would have to have Grain. But neither bay 5 nor bay 6 can hold Livestock, and therefore bay 1 cannot hold Grain.
  - We can eliminate C, D, and E because they all involve placing one of the types of cargo in a spot that is not consistent with the given rules.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. 
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Solution:
According to the given rules, we can make the following deductions:
Bay 6 has to hold Produce, and Bay 5 has to hold Textiles because Textiles is next to Produce.
Bay 4 has to hold Livestock because Livestock has a higher number than Textiles.
Bay 3 has to hold Fuel because Produce is higher than Fuel, so Fuel cannot be in Bay 6 or Bay 5.
Bay 2 has to hold Grain because Grain has to have a higher number than Livestock.
This means that none of the options A, B, D, and E could be true because they violate these rules.
Option C could be true because Bay 4 is holding Textiles.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The six bays are numbered consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  - Exactly six types of cargo are held by the six bays: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  - Grain > Livestock
  - Livestock > Textiles
  - Produce > Fuel
  - Textiles is next to produce.
  - Produce is next to Livestock  
  
Looking at the choices:
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. -> Possible since Produce is not in Bay 2.
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce. -> Possible if Livestock is in Bay 3 and Produce is in Bay 5.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles. -> Possible if Textiles is in Bay 3 and Produce is in Bay 5.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain. -> Possible if Livestock is in Bay 4 and Grain is in Bay 6.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery. -> Possible if Livestock is in Bay 4 and Machinery is in Bay 6.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six bays numbered consecutively from 1 to 6.
  - There are 6 types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, textiles.
  - Grain > Livestock
  - Livestock > Textiles
  - Produce > Fuel 
  - Textiles is next to produce
  
To try to test if each answer choice is true, we can create the following table:

Bay | Cargo
--- | -----
1   |  
2   |  
3   |  
4   |  
5   |  
6   |  

A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. 
Based on the given, Produce > Fuel. Fuel cannot be in bay 2 if Produce is next to Livestock.

B: Bay 4 is holding produce.
This could be true. Since Produce > Fuel and only one bay holds each cargo, Produce must be in bay 5 or 6. Given that Textiles is next to Produce and Livestock > Textiles, if Produce is in bay 5, Livestock must be in bay 4. Therefore, Bay 4 could be holding Produce.

C: Bay 4 is holding textiles.
This could be true. Since Textiles is next to Produce, Textiles must be in Bay 3 or 5. Given that Livestock > Textiles, Livestock must be in either Bay 1 or 2. Therefore, Bay 4 could be holding Textiles.

D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
This could be true. Since Grain > Livestock and Livestock > Textiles, Grain must be either in Bay 1 or 2. Therefore, Bay 5 could be holding Grain.

E: Bay 5 is holding machinery.
This could be true. If Produce is in Bay 6, Livestock must be in Bay 4. In this case, Machinery would have to be in Bay 5. 

Action: Answer("None of the above.")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The loading dock consists of 6 bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively.
  - Exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles—are being held in the bays.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  - If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the two bays can be in either order.
  
Analysis:
- Bay holding produce is next to the bay holding textiles. The order can be PT or TP.
- If Livestock (L) is in Bay 3, then Produce (P) could be in either Bay 4 or Bay 5.
  - If P is in Bay 4, then T must be in Bay 3 and L must be in Bay 6. Bays 1 and 2 would hold G and F, but it is unclear which would hold which.
  - If P is in Bay 5, then T must be in Bay 6 and L must be in Bay 3. Bays 1 and 2 would hold G and F, but it is unclear which would hold which.
- From these possibilities:
  - Bay 2 could hold F.
  - Bay 4 could hold P (and not T).
  - Bay 5 could hold G or M.
  - Bay 3 can't hold T since P is next to it. So, C is incorrect.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Bay numbers and cargo types required to satisfy conditions:
  - Bay holding grain > bay holding livestock
  - Bay holding livestock > bay holding textiles
  - Bay holding produce > bay holding fuel
  - Bay holding textiles is next to bay holding produce
  6 bays, 6 types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, textiles. One bay can only hold one type of cargo.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find the answer that cannot be true if the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.
  - If Bay 4 is holding produce, then Bay 5 must be holding livestock to satisfy the condition that bay holding produce is next to livestock. Therefore, choices D and E are possible. 
  - If Bay 4 is holding textiles, then Bay 3 is holding produce and Bay 5 is holding livestock according to the condition that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. As a result, choices A and B are possible.
  - Therefore, the only choice that cannot be true is choice C, which conflicts with the condition that the bay holding livestock must come before the bay holding textiles.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six bays numbered consecutively from 1 to 6.
  - There are six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - Bay holding grain > Bay holding livestock > Bay holding textiles.
  - Bay holding produce > Bay holding fuel.
  - Bay holding textiles is adjacent to the bay holding produce.

To infer which statement is false based on the information we have, we must first determine the location of produce and the location of livestock. Since the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, textiles can be in bay 3 or bay 5 and produce can be in bay 4 or bay 6. Therefore: 
  - Livestock can be in bay 1 or bay 2.
  - Grain can be in bay 1, bay 2, or bay 3.
  
Let's go through each statement to see if it can be true based on the rules:
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. (Possible because Bay 1 or Bay 3 could be holding grain.)
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce. (Possible as per the rules.)
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles. (Impossible, since in given scenario Bay 5 and Bay 3 hold Textiles and Produce respectively. )
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain. (Possible since Bay 1 or Bay 2 could have grain.)
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery. (Possible since Livestock could be in Bay 1 or Bay 2 and Textile could be in Bay 3 or Bay 5, leaving Machinery for Bay 5.)

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are 5 movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
- Screen 1 and 2 have two movies each, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
- Screen 3 has one movie at 8 P.M.
- Western starts before horror.
- Sci-fi is not on screen 3.
- Romance is not on screen 2.
- Horror and mystery are on different screens.

    If the western and the sci-fi films are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must be shown before or at the same time as the sci-fi. This means the western can be on screen 1 or screen 2, and the sci-fi can be on screen 1 or screen 2. Based on the given information:
    - Romance is not shown on screen 2, so romance can only be shown on screen 1 or 3.
    - Horror and mystery are shown on different screens, so neither horror nor mystery can be shown on screen 1 with the western.
    - Horror cannot be shown on screen 3 because the western begins before the horror.
    - Sci-fi cannot be shown on screen 3.  
    Therefore, the western and the sci-fi films can be shown on Screen 1, with the western starting at 7 P.M., and the sci-fi starting at 9 P.M. It satisfies all the given conditions.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Two movies are shown on screens 1 and 2, while only one is shown on screen 3
  - Screen 3 shows a movie at 8 P.M.
  - Western starts before the horror movie.
  - The sci-fi movie is not on screen 3.
  - Romance is not on screen 2.
  - Horror and mystery are shown on different screens.
Action: Answer("D")

Reasoning:
  - If the Western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then neither of them will be shown on screen 3 because the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
  - Romance is not shown on screen 2, thus it must be shown on screen 1.
  - Western starts before the horror movie, thus it will be shown at 7 P.M. on either screen 1 or screen 2.
  - Therefore, sci-fi film starts at 7 P.M. on the remaining screen where the western is on.
  - Horror film and mystery are shown on different screens. So horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 (since the romance already occupies one slot on screen 1), thus it must be shown on screen 3, which makes the mystery movie to be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M.
  - Therefore, the sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M., which is consistent with choice D.
  
Hence, the answer is D.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. The western begins before the horror film.
  2. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  3. The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  4. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
To check each option:
  A: It is not possible, because the horror film and the mystery cannot be shown on the same screen.
  B: It is possible. If the mystery is shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M. with the horror film shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  C: It is not possible, because the romance cannot be shown on screen 3.
  D: It is not possible, because the sci-fi film is not shown at 7 P.M.
  E: It is possible. If the western begins on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the sci-fi film begins on screen 1 at 9 P.M.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  
If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen:
- The horror film must be shown on a different screen
- The mystery must not be on the same screen as the western and the sci-fi film
- The romance must be scheduled to be shown on screen 2
- Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, which is not the sci-fi film

Option A is possible, but is not necessary since the horror film can be shown on screen 1.

Option B is uncertain, it can be scheduled either at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M. depending on which screen it is shown.

Option C is impossible, because the romance must be scheduled to be shown on screen 2.

Option D is possible, because the sci-fi film can be scheduled to be shown on screen 1 along with the western, then the western will begin at 7 P.M.

Option E is impossible, because the western must begin before the horror film does.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  2. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  3. The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  4. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
  We need to find the option that could be true when the Western and the sci-fi film are scheduled on the same screen. 
  
  A: This option does not satisfy condition 1, so it cannot be true.
  B: This option does not provide any information on the scheduled screen for the Western and the sci-fi film, so it cannot be true or false.
  C: This option does not satisfy condition 3, so it cannot be true.
  D: This option cannot be true since the sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M. (condition 5).
  E: If the Western and the sci-fi are scheduled for screen 3, then the Western must start at 8 P.M. (condition 1). This leaves screen 1 for the horror film and the mystery, with the horror film starting at 7 P.M. and the mystery starting at 9 P.M. This satisfies conditions 2-4, so this option could be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  According to the given conditions:
  - There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, western.
  - Each movie is shown exactly once on one of the three screens (screens 1, 2 and 3).
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each (one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.).
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then:
  - The screen showing the western and sci-fi movies is either screen 1 or screen 2.
  - Since the romance cannot be shown on screen 2, the romance must be on screen 1 if the western and sci-fi movies are on screen 2.
  - The horror film cannot be shown on the same screen as the mystery.
  - The western begins before the horror film.

Action: Answer("D")  
The sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M. because its screen, which is either screen 1 or screen 2, is already showing another movie at 7 P.M. Therefore, the sci-fi film must begin at 9 P.M. on the same screen as the western.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 5 movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 1 and Screen 2 show 2 movies each, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly 1 movie at 8 P.M.
  - The western begins before the horror film.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  - If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then:
    - The romance and mystery films must be shown on screens 1 and 2, and not necessarily in that order.
    - The horror film must be shown on screen 3.
    - We don't know which movie would be shown on the same screen as the horror film.
    
Solution:
  - The only answer that could be true under these conditions is if the horror film is shown on screen 2. 
  - Therefore, Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Western film begins before the horror film.
- Sci-fi film is not on screen 3.
- Romance is not on screen 2.
- Horror and Mystery are on different screens.
- Screens 1 & 2 have two movies each.
- Screen 3 has only one movie.

If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, that means that the western is not on screen 3, leaving the other two. Also, since the romance is not on screen 2, it means that the romance must be on screen 3. Horror and mystery cannot be on screen 3 since it is only showing one movie, so both must be on screen 1 and 2. Therefore, the schedule must be as follows:
- Screen 1 | 7 PM | Mystery
- Screen 1 | 9 PM | Horror
- Screen 2 | 7 PM | Western
- Screen 2 | 9 PM | Romance
- Screen 3 | 8 PM | Sci-Fi

Action: Answer("D") - The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  2. The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  3. The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  4. Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  5. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  6. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.

Let's check each option against the above rules:
A: If the Western and the sci-fi film are on the same screen, it means that the comedy and the romance will be on the other screen, which cannot be screen 2 as the romance is not shown on screen 2. Additionally, the horror and the mystery are by rule on different screens. Therefore, the horror film cannot be on screen 2. Thus, this option is not possible.
B: If the mystery begins at 9 P.M., then it cannot be on the same screen as the horror film by rule. Thus, this option is also not possible.
C: The romance film cannot be shown on screen 3. Hence, this option is not possible.
D: If the sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M., then it cannot be shown on screen 3 since screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M. This option is not possible.
E: If the Western begins at 8 P.M, then it is possible to have the sci-fi film shown on the same screen since it is not shown on screen 3, leaving the horror film and comedy/romance for screens 1 and 2. This seems correct.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies showing at the theater: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screen 1 and screen 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, beginning at 8 P.M.
  The western must begin before the horror film begins.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  Let's consider each option:
  A: There are only two movies shown on screen 1 and screen 2 and neither the horror film nor the mystery is shown on screen 1, so if neither the horror film nor the mystery is shown on screen 2, then the horror film will not be shown on screen 2.
  B: There are no restrictions on what movie can begin at 9 P.M. on screen 1 or screen 2, so the mystery can begin at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, but can be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  D: If the western and the sci-fi are scheduled to be shown on the same screen and the western begins before the horror film, then the western must begin at 7 P.M. on screen 1, which means the sci-fi will begin at 9 P.M. on screen 1.
  E: If the western begins at 8 P.M., then it cannot be shown on screen 1 or screen 2, and the sci-fi must begin at 8 P.M. on screen 3, but this violates the condition that the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: Which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one?
Choices:
  A: Yardsign
  B: Vegemite, Wellspring
  C: Vegemite, Yardsign
  D: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign
  E: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, Zircon
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign can perform in slot one.
- Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite cannot perform in the last three slots (slots four to six). 
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Xpert must perform in slot six.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and it cannot be in slot six, so Uneasy must perform in slot four or slot five.
- Therefore, slots one, two, and three must be filled by some combination of Yardsign, Vegemite, and Wellspring.
- Zircon performs in a slot before Xpert, so Zircon can perform in slot three, four, or five.

Analysis:
- The answer choices are:
  A: Yardsign
  B: Vegemite, Wellspring
  C: Vegemite, Yardsign
  D: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign
  E: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, Zircon
- Yardsign can perform in slot one.
- From the remaining choices, the options with Vegemite are the only ones that can have a band in slot one that is not also in a later slot.
- Wellspring could be in slot two with Vegemite or in slot three without Vegemite.
- Thus, the list of bands that could perform in slot one is:
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Slot 1 is the earliest of the slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  The following bands are earlier than Xpert: Wellspring and Zircon.
  The following bands are earlier than Zircon: Vegemite.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  
Analysis:
  Yardsign must perform in slot one, as it is one of the first three slots and no other band is given to perform only in these slots.
  The bands that are earlier than Xpert are Wellspring and Zircon, so the combination of either of these with Yardsign in slot 1 satisfies all the given conditions.
  Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Wellspring and Zircon must perform in earlier slots than Xpert. So, a combination of these three bands (Vegemite, Wellspring, and Zircon) in slot 1 satisfies all the given conditions.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The band performing in slot one must be one of the bands that can perform in one of the first three slots. Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot one. Xpert cannot perform in slot one since both Wellspring and Zircon perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in one of the first three slots. 
  A: Yardsign can perform in slot one, but the question is asking for a complete and accurate list.
  B: Both Vegemite and Wellspring can perform in slot one, since they both perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. 
  C: Although Yardsign can perform in slot one, Vegemite cannot perform in slot one because it cannot perform in a later slot than Zircon. 
  D: Both Vegemite and Wellspring can perform in slot one, since they both perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Yardsign can also perform in slot one since it can perform in any of the first three slots. 
  E: Zircon cannot perform in the first three slots due to the constraint that it must perform in a later slot than Vegemite. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: In order to fill the six slots, six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—must perform in one of the slots. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
To fill the slot number one, we need to look for the bands which perform in one of the first three spots. 
A: Yardsign will perform in one of the first three slots, but we don't know if it will take slot one.
B: Vegemite and Wellspring will perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, but we don't know if either of them will take slot one.
C: Vegemite and Yardsign will perform in an earlier slot than Xpert and Yardsign will perform in one of the first three slots. Hence, Yardsign could perform in slot one but we don't know about Vegemite.
D: Vegemite and Wellspring will perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Yardsign will perform in one of the first three slots. Hence, any of these three can perform in slot one.
E: All four bands can perform in slot one, but the answer was asked for the complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one. So, we choose option D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The order of the slots must follow the given constraints:
      - Vegemite < Zircon
      - Wellspring, Zircon < Xpert
      - Uneasy is at one of the last three slots
      - Yardsign is at one of the first three slots
  - We are looking for a band that could perform in slot one, so it must be one of the two earlier slots according to the constraint of Yardsign.
  - It cannot be Uneasy because they will only play one of the last three slots.
  - It cannot be Xpert because Wellspring and Zircon must each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - So the possibilities for the band that performs in slot one are either Yardsign, Vegemite, or Wellspring.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
- Slot one precedes slot six. 

Solution:
- Since Yardsign is required to perform in one of the first three slots, it means they could perform in slot one.
- Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, it means Vegemite could perform in slot one as Zircon should perform in a later slot than Vegemite.
- As per the constraint, if one of Wellspring or Zircon performs in slot one, then Xpert will have to go in a slot which is earlier than slot one. But this is not possible as slot one is the earliest slot. So, neither of Wellspring or Zircon can perform in slot one.
- So, a complete and accurate list of bands who could perform in slot one is Yardsign and Vegemite.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a list of bands that could perform in slot one.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.

Eliminating bands that cannot perform in slot one: 
 - Uneasy is out because it performs in one of the last three slots.
 - Xpert is out because both Wellspring and Zircon perform in earlier slots.

Eliminating bands that cannot perform before slot one:
 - Yardsign is one of the bands but its slot is not determined. 
 - Both Wellspring and Zircon should perform before Xpert, so they could potentially be in any slot before slot one (i.e. they could be in slot two, three, four, five, or six).
 - Vegemite should perform before Zircon, and it can perform in either slot one or two.

Finalizing the possible bands for slot one:
 - Yardsign, Wellspring, Vegemite, and Zircon are all potential candidates for slot one.
 - Uneasy and Xpert are eliminated.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - "Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon."
  - "Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert."
  - "Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots."
  - "Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots."
  
  Slot 1 can only be filled by one of the first three bands, which are the bands that perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. These bands must also satisfy the other constraints.
  
  A: Yardsign can perform in slot one, but none of the other constraints are satisfied.
  B: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than at least one of the bands, but none of the other constraints are satisfied.
  C: Vegemite can perform in slot one and Yardsign can perform in slot two. However, this leaves slots three through six with no bands that satisfy the constraints.
  D: This is a complete and accurate list of bands that could perform in slot one. Vegemite and Wellspring can perform in slots one and two in any order. Yardsign can perform in slot three and Uneasy in slots four, five, or six.
  E: Zircon can't perform in earlier slot than Xpert but the statement says that he needs to perform before, so it disqualifies this option.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We are looking for a list of bands that could perform in slot one given the constraints provided.
  The order of the bands is: Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, Uneasy, Zircon.
  Vegemite must perform earlier than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon must perform earlier than Xpert.
  Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We are looking for the possible bands that could perform in slot one based on the given conditions. 
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. 
  There are six slots and six bands so each band will perform in just one slot.
  
  A: Yardsign is the only band that can perform in slot one. This option is consistent with the given conditions.
  B: Based on the given conditions, neither Vegemite nor Wellspring can perform in slot one since slot one is the earliest slot, and both bands can only perform in a later slot. 
  C: Similar to B, Vegemite can not perform in the first slot since it can only perform in a later slot. Yardsign can perform in the first slot, but this option is not complete since only one of the two allowed bands is listed.  
  D: This is the complete and accurate list. Vegemite and Wellspring can each perform in slot one based on the given conditions. Yardsign can also perform in slot one as stated in the conditions. 
  E: Zircon can only perform in a later slot, so this option is not accurate.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly eight books are placed on three shelves.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on:
    - L is not on the bottom shelf
    - H is not on the top shelf
    - Therefore, L is on the middle shelf and H is on the bottom shelf.

Analysis:
  A: F and G could be on different shelves or on the same shelf as each other. Insufficient information.
  B: G and H are on different shelves. It is certain that they are not on the same shelf.
  C: H is on the bottom shelf. M is placed on the same shelf as F, so either both F and M are on the top shelf or on the middle shelf. Insufficient information.
  D: G is not on the middle shelf as I is placed there. Insufficient information.
  E: K is on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, there is no certainty of whether they would be on the same shelf or not.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O
- There are exactly 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom
- At least 2 books are on each shelf
- More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf
- I is on the middle shelf
- K is on a higher shelf than F
- O is on a higher shelf than L
- F is on the same shelf as M

Action: Answer("C")
If L is on a shelf higher than H, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If L is on the middle shelf, then F and M must also be on the middle shelf, and K and O must be on the bottom shelf, since O is on a higher shelf than L. This means that G, H, and I must all be on the top shelf, since there are only two books left (G and I) and they must be on the same shelf. Therefore, H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, so the answer is (C).
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- F and M are on the same shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then one possible arrangement is:
Bottom shelf: FMO
Middle shelf: I
Top shelf: GHLK

In this case, answer (B) is true, because G and H are both on the top shelf. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - We have 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O)
  - We have 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom)
  - Each shelf must have at least 2 books
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top
  - I is placed on the middle shelf
  - K is placed higher than F
  - O is placed higher than L
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M

Action: Answer("C") 

If L is on a shelf higher than H, then H must be on the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf, and more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so at least 3 books are placed on the bottom shelf. Therefore, I and K (placed higher than F) must be on the middle and top shelves, in some order. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and two books must be on that shelf, it follows that G and either F or M must also be on the middle shelf. Therefore, the remaining two books (L and the other book between F and M) must be placed on the top shelf. This means that H and M are both on the bottom shelf, so they must be placed on the same shelf as each other. Therefore, the answer is (C) H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least 2 books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: Answer("B")
  
Explanation: 
- Suppose L is placed on the bottom shelf. This means that at least 2 books are placed on each of the top and middle shelves, and at least 4 books are placed on the bottom shelf. 
- From the given conditions, we know I is on the middle shelf and more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- Thus, we can infer that K, O, F, M and any other book(s) would be on the bottom shelf.
- Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, we can infer that F is also on the bottom shelf.
- This means that G, H, and L would be on the top two shelves.
- If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L on the middle shelf.
- Therefore, G and H would be on the same top shelf otherwise H would be alone on the top shelf, and there would not be enough books to fulfill the conditions of the question.

Therefore, the answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Eight books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) are placed on a bookcase with three shelves. 
  - At least two books are on each shelf. 
  - The conditions are: 
      a. more books on the bottom than on the top shelf. 
      b. I is on the middle shelf. 
      c. K is on a higher shelf than F. 
      d. O is on a higher shelf than L.
      e. F is on the same shelf as M.
  
Action: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, it means H is either on the top or middle shelves. Since I is on the middle shelf, and there are only two books on that shelf. Thus, only one book is placed on the top shelf, which is fewer than the books placed on the bottom shelf. This means that H must be on the middle shelf, so it is placed with I. Therefore, C: H and M are placed on the same shelf with each other. Answer("C").
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- Each shelf has at least two books.
- There are exactly three shelves.
- If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then we can deduce that H is placed on the topmost shelf. 

Reasoning: 
- Since we know that H is placed on the topmost shelf, and F is placed lower than K, we eliminate option E. 
- Since F and M are placed on the same shelf, and we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we eliminate option A. 
- Since option B has no relation to H and L, we eliminate it.
- Since I is placed on the middle shelf and G has no relation to H or L, we eliminate option D. 
- Since H is placed on the topmost shelf and M is placed on the same shelf as F, C is impossible as it would mean more books were on the middle shelf.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Eight books are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves.
  At least two books are placed on each shelf, so there are no empty shelves.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Action: Answer("C") 

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on , it cannot be on the bottom shelf. Also, as more books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf, therefore L must be on the middle shelf.

Now, from the given conditions, the only way for H to be placed is on the top shelf. Hence, L is on a higher shelf than H.

Therefore, H and M must be on the same shelf. It is the only option that must be true. So, the answer is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  8 books are placed on a bookcase with 3 shelves.
  Top shelf, middle shelf, bottom shelf
  Conditions:
  1. More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  2. I is placed on the middle shelf.
  3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
  We are also given that L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, so either H is on the top shelf and L is on the middle or bottom shelf or H is on the middle shelf and L is on the bottom shelf
  
  A: There is no information in the statement of the problem that allows us to determine the placement of F and G relative to each other, so this statement cannot be true.
  B: There is no information in the statement of the problem that allows us to determine the placement of G and H relative to each other, so this statement cannot be true.
  C: There is no information in the statement of the problem that requires H and M to be placed on the same shelf as each other, so this statement cannot be true.
  D: There is no information in the statement of the problem that requires I and G to be placed on the same shelf as each other, so this statement cannot be true.
  E: There is no information in the statement of the problem that requires K and O to be placed on the same shelf as each other, so this statement cannot be true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O are 8 books placed on a 3-shelves bookcase.
  2. The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  3. I is placed on the middle shelf.
  4. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  5. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  6. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
First, let's list what we know about the positions of the books based on the given conditions:
1. Bottom shelf: K, O + (at least) 1 more book
2. Middle shelf: I, F, M + (at least) 1 more book
3. Top shelf: G, H, L + (at least) 1 more book

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then:
- H is on the top and L on the middle, or
- H is on the middle and L on the bottom.

Option A, B, D, E do not have any mention of shelf placement of L or H.
Option C is true if H and M are on the middle shelf. But a counterexample exists where:
- L is on the bottom shelf
- H is on the top shelf
- M is on the middle shelf, and
- F and G are on any one of the shelves.

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("None of the above")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: The assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  E: Xu is assigned parking space #5.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The six employees (Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young) must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young's parking space > Togowa's parking space.
  Xu's parking space > Souza's parking space.
  Robertson's parking space > Young's parking space.
  Robertson's parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
Analysis:
  Choice A cannot be the answer because Souza may be assigned #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6, and there are multiple valid assignments.
  Choice B cannot be the answer because it does not tell us where the remaining employees are assigned, and there are multiple valid assignments.
  Choice C cannot be the answer because it does not tell us where the remaining employees are assigned, and there are multiple valid assignments.
  Choice D can be the answer because it ensures that Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which in turn uniquely determines all of the other assignments. 
  Choice E cannot be the answer because it conflicts with the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and there are multiple valid assignments.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
  There are six employees and six parking spaces, so each employee will be assigned a unique parking space. 
  Robertson must be assigned one of the four parking spaces (#1, #2, #3, or #4). 
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Thus, Togowa must be assigned Parking space #1 or #2, and Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6. 
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Thus, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Thus, Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.

Answer: 
  Choice A, Souza is assigned parking space #1, is not sufficient to determine the assignment of parking spaces to all six employees.
  Choice B, Young is assigned parking space #2, is not sufficient to determine the assignment of parking spaces to all six employees.
  Choice C, Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, is not sufficient to determine the assignment of parking spaces to all six employees.
  Choice D, Robertson is assigned parking space #4, is sufficient to determine the assignment of parking spaces to all six employees. 
  Choice E, Xu is assigned parking space #5, is not sufficient to determine the assignment of parking spaces to all six employees.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  - Each employee must be assigned a different parking space from 1 to 6.
  - Young's parking space number must be lower than Togowa's.
  - Xu's parking space number must be higher than Souza's.
  - Robertson's parking space number must be 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  
  A: If Souza is in parking space 1, then Xu would be in parking space 6, which would mean that the conditions about Young and Robertson's parking spaces would be contradicted. This option is not possible.
  B: If Young is in parking space 2, that would mean that Robertson would have to be in parking space 3, which contradicts the condition that Robertson's parking space number must be 1, 2, 3, or 4. This option is not possible.
  C: Vaughn's parking space assignment does not provide enough information to determine the assignments of the other employees. This option is not possible.
  D: If Robertson is assigned parking space 4, then Young must have been assigned parking space 5, Xu would have been assigned parking space 6, and Togawa, Souza, and Vaughn would take parking spaces 1, 2, and 3 in an unknown order, satisfying all of the conditions given in the problem. Thus, this option would fully and uniquely determine the parking space assignments.
  E: If Xu is assigned parking space 5, then Young, Togowa, and Robertson would have to be in parking spaces 3, 4, and 6, respectively. Then, Souza and Vaughn would have to be in parking spaces 1 and 2 in an unknown order, but this violates the condition that Xu's parking space number must be higher than Souza's. This option is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee must be assigned one of the six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No employee can be assigned the same parking space as another employee.
  Rules:
    1. Young's parking space > Togowa's parking space.
    2. Xu's parking space > Souza's parking space.
    3. Robertson's parking space > Young's parking space.
    4. Robertson's parking space < #5.
    
A: If Souza is assigned parking space #1, the only available parking spaces for Young and Robertson would be #2,  #3, #4, whose assignment would violate rule 3. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.
B: If Young is assigned parking space #2, Robertson will be assigned parking space #1 for violating rule 3. As per rule 4, Robertson can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Thus, Robertson will be assigned parking space #1, Young will be assigned parking space #3 or #4, and Togowa will be assigned parking space #5. This would leave Souza and Vaughn to be assigned parking spaces #2 and #6, but we do not know which one is assigned to which employee. This means that the assignment is not fully and uniquely determined. Therefore, this choice is not the answer.
C: If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, the only available parking spaces for Togowa and Young would be #4, #5, and #6. This would violate rule 1. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.
D: If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, Robertson and Young cannot be assigned parking spaces #1, #2, and #3 for violating rule 3. This means that Robertson and Young will be assigned parking spaces #5 and #6, respectively. Togowa and Souza will be assigned parking spaces #1 and #2, respectively.  This leaves only parking space #3 for Xu, so the assignment is fully and uniquely determined.
E: If Xu is assigned parking space #5, the only available parking spaces for Souza and Togowa would be #1, #2, #3, and #4. This would violate rule 2 because Xu cannot be assigned a lower numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The six employees must each get one of six parking spaces.
  No two employees can have the same parking space.
  Young's parking space > Togowa's parking space.
  Xu's parking space > Souza's parking space.
  Robertson's parking space > Young's parking space. 
  Robertson's parking space ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}.
Action: 
  The only rule that places a restriction on the possible assignments is rule 4, which sets limits on Robertson's parking space assignment. 
  If Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and no two employees can have the same parking space, the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined.
  Thus, the best answer is D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4. 
  Answer("D").
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees to be assigned to parking spaces #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  Each employee must be assigned a different parking space.
  Young > Togowa, Xu > Souza, Robertson > Young
  Robertson must have parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: According to the rules, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Since there are no other restrictions on where Robertson can be assigned, this fully determines the parking space assignments for all six employees.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
    1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
    3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analysis:
  - Rule 4 tells us that Robertson must be assigned one of the first four parking spaces available: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  - Rule 3 tells us that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Hence, Robertson cannot be assigned space #5 or #6.
  - Therefore, Robertson is assigned either space #1, #2, #3, or #4. However, we do not know which parking space he is assigned yet.
  - Using Rule 1, Young can be assigned either space #5 or #6.
  - Using Rule 2, Xu can be assigned either space #5 or #6, because both spaces are higher-numbered than Souza's.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1. By Rule 3, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1. By Rule 4, there is only one parking space left for Xu and Souza to share, which is parking space #5 for Xu and parking space #6 for Souza. Finally, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #3, because all the other parking spaces are already assigned. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined if Young is assigned parking space #2.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are six employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.
  Each employee should be assigned one parking space: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  No two employees can have the same parking space.
  Young's parking space number must be less than Togowa's.
  Xu's parking space number must be less than Souza's.
  Robertson's parking space number must be less than Young's.
  Robertson's parking space number must be #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
A: If Souza is assigned parking space #1, it is possible that Xu is assigned parking space #2, Young is assigned parking space #3, Robertson is assigned parking space #4, Togowa is assigned parking space #5, and Vaughn is assigned parking space #6. This violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, this choice is not sufficient to uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces.

B: If Young is assigned parking space #2, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, and the remaining employees must be assigned parking spaces #3, #4, #5, and #6 in some order. However, it is not clear where the other employees should be assigned. Therefore, this choice is not sufficient to uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces.

C: If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, it is possible that Robertson is assigned parking space #1, Xu is assigned parking space #2, Souza is assigned parking space #4, Young is assigned parking space #5, and Togowa is assigned parking space #6. This violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this choice is not sufficient to uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces.

D: If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Togowa must be assigned parking space #6, and the remaining employees must be assigned parking spaces #1, #2, and #3 in some order. This satisfies all of the rules and uniquely determines the assignment of parking spaces.

E: If Xu is assigned parking space #5, it is not clear where the other employees should be assigned. Therefore, this choice is not sufficient to uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Six new employees are each assigned one of the six parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  - No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.
  - Young > Togowa
  - Xu > Souza
  - Robertson > Young
  - Robertson can be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Analyzing the choices: 
  A: If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Xu would have to be assigned parking space #2 or higher due to the rule Xu > Souza. However, this violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, this option is not valid.
  B: If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa would have to be assigned parking space #1, which violates the Young > Togowa rule. Therefore, this option is not valid.
  C: If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then the last three employees, including Xu, Young, and Togowa, must be assigned parking spaces #4, #5, and #6, in some order. However, this violates the Robertson > Young rule since Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, this option is not valid.
  D: If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Robertson would be assigned the fourth parking space, and the remaining five employees would need to be assigned the other five parking spaces. This can be done in only one way consistent with the given rules. Therefore, this option is valid and is the best answer.
  E: If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza would be assigned parking space #1, Togowa would be assigned parking space #2, Young would be assigned parking space #3, Robertson would be assigned parking space #4, and Vaughn would be assigned parking space #6. This contradicts the Xu > Souza rule. Therefore, this option is not valid.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- There are 6 employees and 6 parking spaces.
- Each employee can only be assigned one parking space and no two employees can be assigned the same space.
- The following conditions are given:
  1. Young > Togowa
  2. Xu > Souza
  3. Robertson > Young
  4. Robertson is assigned to space #1, #2, #3, or #4

Analysis:
- Condition 4 means that Robertson can only be assigned to one of four parking spaces, which are #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- From condition 3, we know that Young cannot be assigned to any of these four spaces because he must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Robertson.
- Therefore, Young must be assigned either space #5 or #6.
- From condition 1, we know that Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered space than Young. Hence, Togowa can only be assigned to space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- Robertson cannot be assigned space #5 or #6 because #1, #2, #3, and #4 are the only options for him. Hence, either Xu or Vaughn must be assigned to space #5 and the other to space #6, but we don't know which will get which space.
- From condition 2, we know that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza. Therefore, either Xu is assigned space #5 or he is assigned space #6 and Souza is assigned space #5.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, zoologist).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Solution:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then there must be one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist on the panel.
  From the given conditions, F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, either F or K must be on the panel.
  If F is the botanist on the panel, then at most one zoologist can be on the panel. Therefore, either K or M must be on the panel as a chemist. 
  If K is the chemist on the panel, then there must be a zoologist on the panel. Therefore, either P and R must be on the panel given that M cannot be selected.
  If M is the chemist on the panel, then both P and R must be on the panel. Therefore, the panel would have two zoologists in this case.
  Thus, the only possible choices for the panel scientists are F or K (botanist), G or H (chemist), and P and R (zoologists) or M (chemist) and P (zoologist).
  Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect since they do not result in selecting scientists following the given conditions.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The question provides several conditions that govern the selection of scientists:
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then each of the three types of scientists will be represented on the panel. However, we need to consider whether any of the other conditions are violated.
  
  A: If F or K is selected, then we violate the condition that F and K cannot both be selected. This choice is incorrect.
  
  B: If F or M is selected, then we do not violate the condition that F and K or K and M cannot both be selected. This choice is possible.
  
  C: If K or M is selected, then we violate the condition that F and K or K and M cannot both be selected. This choice is incorrect.
  
  D: If M or Q is selected, then we violate the condition that both P and R must be selected if M is selected. This choice is incorrect.
  
  E: If P or Q is selected, then we do not violate any of the given conditions. This choice is possible.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The panel will consist of five scientists selected from among three botanists, three chemists, and three zoologists.
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, zoologist).
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Analysis:
  Since G and H are in the panel, both of them cannot be from the same type of scientists.
  They either are a botanist, chemist, and zoologist. If both are botanists, at most one zoologist can be chosen. The conditions show that if M is chosen, both P and R must be chosen. Thus, if M is not selected, one of P and R cannot be chosen. We have seen that F cannot be chosen if K is chosen. Thus, if G and H are selected, the panel must include K or else M. The answer that fits this description is (B).
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The scientists must be selected according to some conditions:
  - At least one scientist of each of the three types (botanists, chemists, and zoologists) must be included.
  - If more than 1 botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

To answer the question, we can use the following strategy:
- If G and H are present, but not F, then we need to have at least one botanist amongst the four scientists who are now to be chosen.
- If we choose F, what's left to find is at least one chemist and at least one zoologist.
- If we choose K, what's left to find is at least one chemist and at least one zoologist.
- If we choose M, we must pick P and R
Thus the answer is "D: M or else Q" since both M and Q are zoologists. Hence, if one of Q or M is selected, there will be at least one scientist of each type among the panelists, and the other conditions will be met.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - A panel of five scientists will be formed: 3 botanists, 3 chemists, and 3 zoologists.
  - The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  - If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  - F and K cannot both be selected.
  - K and M cannot both be selected.
  - If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.

To consider all cases, we have:
- G and H are selected, and F and K are not selected.
  - In this case, we must choose one botanist from {F, K}. But F and K cannot both be selected. So we have:
    - F is selected. Then we must select 2 scientists from {G, H, L, M, P, Q, R}. We can select any two, except we cannot choose K or M together since K and M cannot both be selected. So we have:
      - G and L are selected. Then we must select {H, P, Q, R}. Since we cannot choose both P and R unless we also choose M, we have two subcases:
         - G, L, and H are selected. Then we must select {P, Q, R}. We can choose any two from these three since there is no restriction.
         - G, L, and P or Q are selected. Then we must select {R, H}, and we must select both to satisfy the condition that both P and R must be selected if M is selected. Thus, one possible panel is {F, G, L, P, R}.
      - G and P or Q are selected. Then we must select {H, L, R}. If we select R, then we must also select both P and R to satisfy the condition that both P and R must be selected if M is selected. But then we cannot select H, since more than one botanist is selected. So we must select L instead of R. Thus, one possible panel is {F, G, L, P, H}.
    - K is selected. Then we must select 2 scientists from {G, H, L, M, P, Q, R}. We can select any two, except we cannot choose F or M. So we have several subcases:
        - G and L are selected. Then we must select {H, P, Q, R}. We can choose any two from these four since there is no restriction.
        - G and P or Q are selected. Then we must select {H, L, R}, and we can choose any two from these three since there is no restriction.
        - L and M are selected. Then we must select {G, H, P, Q, R}, and we can choose any three from these five since there is no restriction.
        - P, Q, and M are selected. Then we must select {G, H, R}. To satisfy the condition that both P and R must be selected if M is selected, we must select both P and R, and we cannot select F. Thus, one possible panel is {K, G, H, P, R}.

- G and H are selected, and M is not selected.
  - In this case, we must choose one chemist from {K, L, M}. But K and M cannot both be selected, so we have:
    - K is selected, then we must select {F, H, L, P, Q}. We can choose any 4 from these 5 since there is no restriction. Thus, one possible panel is {G, H, K, L, P}.
    - L is selected, then we must select {F, G, H, P, Q}. We can choose any 2 from these 5 since there is no restriction. Thus, one possible panel is {F, G, H, L, Q}.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- If both G and H are among the selected scientists, then one of the botanists F, G, or H will be chosen. 
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be chosen which means either P or Q or R will be on the panel, but not two of them.
- If F is already not part of the group, then either K or M will be part of the panel. If F is already part of the group then we don't have information about K or M.
- If M is already part of the panel, then both P and R must be a part of the panel.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The panel must have at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected, and K and M cannot both be selected.
  
Analysis:
  If both G and H are selected, then one of them would be a botanist, and there must be at least one more botanist. Thus, either F, G, or H must be selected.
  If F is selected, then to accommodate two botanists, at most one zoologist can be selected. Due to this constraint, K or M must be selected as the third member to satisfy the condition of selecting at least one chemist.
  If K or M is selected as the third member, then the corresponding other chemist cannot be selected, due to the constraint that F and K cannot both be selected, and K and M cannot both be selected.
  But if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. Due to this additional condition, M is selected with P and R, so K cannot be selected.

Action: Answer("B")  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or else M.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected. 
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then panel must have at least two botanists because if there is only one botanist, there will be at most one zoologist which will violate the condition that "more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected".
  
  If we select F, then we can have a panel of three types having at least one representative from each habitat. If we do not select F, then we must select either K or M.

Analysis:
  A cannot be true because if we select F, we will have two botanists, and there is a possibility of selecting more than one zoologist.
  B cannot be true because if we select M, both P and Q must also be selected, but then at least one zoologist will not be selected.
  C cannot be true because K and M cannot both be selected.
  D cannot be true because we do not have any evidence about Q being selected.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. The panel must have at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  3. F and K cannot both be selected.
  4. K and M cannot both be selected.
  5. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
Solution:
  If both G and H are selected, then the panel would consist of:
  - 1 botanist from {F, G, H}
  - 1 chemist from {K, L, M}
  - 1 zoologist from {P, Q, R}
  Since F and K cannot both be selected, we have three cases to consider:
  Case 1: If F is chosen as the botanist, then K is out. We cannot select L as the chemist since we need more than one option for zoologist. So the chemist has to be M. Since M is chosen, P and R both have to be chosen. This satisfies all conditions.
  Case 2: If G is chosen as the botanist, then we have two sub-cases:
          SubCase 2.1: If L or M is chosen as the chemist, then we would have two chemists from {K, L, M}. In this case, the zoologist must be one of {P, R}. But we cannot select both since we have more than one botanist. So the only option is that one of P or R is selected. Then, we cannot have L since we need M, so we have to choose M as the chemist. But we also need a botanist other than G, so F has to be chosen as the botanist. This satisfies all the conditions, but in this case, K is not included as one of the panelists.
          SubCase 2.2: If L and M are both excluded from being the chemist, then only K is left. So K has to be chosen. In this case, only one zoologist can be selected. So we choose either P or R. Since we chose K, and K and M cannot both be selected, M is excluded. So the only botanist left is F. Hence, F would be chosen. This satisfies all conditions, but in this case, M is not included as one of  the panelists.
  Case 3: If H is chosen as the botanist, then we have two sub-cases:
          SubCase 3.1: If L or M is chosen as the chemist, then we would have two chemists from {K, L, M}. In this case, the zoologist must be one of {P, R}. But we cannot select both since we have more than one botanist. So the only option is that one of P or R is selected. Choose M as the chemist. Then, select both P and R as the zoologists since M is selected. Hence, we successfully satisfy all conditions.
          SubCase 3.2: If L and M are both excluded from being the chemist, then only K is left. So K has to be chosen. In this case, either P or Q can be selected as the zoologist since we need only one from two zoologists. Since we chose K, and K and M cannot both be selected, M is excluded. So the only botanist left is F. Hence, F would be chosen. This satisfies all conditions, but in this case, M is not included as one of the panelists.
  
Conclusion:
  The panel would satisfy all the conditions under all cases except Case 2 SubCase 2.1 and also Case 3 Subcase 2.1. So at least one of the options presented in these two sub-cases should be included in the answer. Among the options given below, only option A satisfies this requirement; hence Answer("A") is the correct option. 

Answer: A
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1.The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  3. F and K cannot both be selected.
  4. K and M cannot both be selected.
  5. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
For the panel to include both G and H, at least one more botanist must be included, and at most one zoologist can be included. Given conditions 3 and 4, it follows that if G and H are included, F must also be included. So, the panel must include F, and at least one more scientist. If M is included, then P and R must both be included. So, if M is included, then the only available choices are K and L, and only K satisfies the condition that the panel include at least one representative of each type. If M is not included, then the panel must include one of K and M, and at most one other chemist. The only available choices in this case are L, P, and Q. In order to satisfy the conditions of the problem if H and G are both included, K must be one of the two chemists on the panel, since no other chemists satisfy the condition that the panel include one representative of each type. This requirement is satisfied only by Answer("A") choice A: F or else K.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis:
  - According to the conditions, there are at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  - Parra and Tiao cannot work in Zone 3 because they work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively.
  - Udall cannot work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and he works with Stuckey who is in the same sales zone as him.
  - Therefore, the only possible sales representatives working in Zone 3 are Kim, Mahr, and Quinn, with Stuckey also potentially being in Zone 3 but that is not necessary. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Only one of Parra or Tiao can work in Zone 1.
  Only one of Tiao or Udall can work in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  Two sales representatives must work in Zone 1 and 2 together, so only one is in zone 3. Kim, Mahr, and Quinn have not been assigned a zone yet, and the more likely chance is that they are assigned to Zone 3.

Analysis:
  A is impossible because there must be at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  B is impossible because Tiao must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  C is impossible because Parra must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3, and if he works in Zone 3 Quinn will work in the same zone
  D is a possibility, but It's more likely that Kim would work with Mahr and the other three work in Zone 1 or Zone 2
  E is also possible and has at least two representatives working in zone 3. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A: Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3 because all the sales representatives must be allocated to one of the three zones and there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - Choice B: Tiao works in Zone 2, Udall cannot work in Zone 3, so this combination is not possible.
  - Choice C: Parra works in Zone 1, and both Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so they cannot work in Zone 3.
  - Choice D: This combination consists of three sales representatives, but there must be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 according to the given conditions.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: The sales representatives working in Zone 3 should be Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall because the four representatives must be allocated to one of the three zones and there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 according to the given conditions.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The software company employs seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao and Udall.
  - The sales representatives work in three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work on the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work on the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  - Given the conditions outlined, we know that Parra and Tiao cannot both work in Zone 1, and Tiao and Udall cannot both work in Zone 2. So, one of Parra/Tiao is in Zone 1 and one of Tiao/Udall is in Zone 2. 
  - The condition that Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone means that neither Stuckey nor Udall can work in Zone 1 (where Parra or Tiao works).
  - The condition that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone means that if one works in Zone 3, they both do. Similarly, if one works in Zone 2, they both do.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  - We can conclude that either Parra or Tiao is working in Zone 1, and therefore the other must be working in Zone 3.
  - We can conclude that either Tiao or Udall is working in Zone 2, and therefore the other must be working in Zone 3.
  - Parra and Quinn work on the same sales zone, and so are both working either in Zone 2 or Zone 3. If either is working in Zone 2, then Udall is in Zone 3 and Stuckey as well, which would make at least three representatives (Tiao, Udall, Stuckey) in Zone 3, which conflicts with the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra and Quinn are working in Zone 3.
  - Since Stuckey and Udall are working on the same sales zone, they must be in Zone 3.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The software company employs seven sales representatives to work in three sales zones.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Option A: Kim and Mahr are not mentioned to be working in Zone 3.
Option B: Kim and Tiao are mentioned to work in different Zones, and there is no mention of another representative in Zone 3 to have more sales representatives working there than in Zone 2.
Option C: Parra and Quinn are mentioned to be working in the same Zone, but there is no mention of another representative in Zone 3 to have more sales representatives working there than in Zone 2.
Option D: Stuckey and Udall are mentioned to work in the same Zone, but there is no mention of another representative in Zone 3 to have more sales representatives working there than in Zone 2.
Option E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall are not enough representatives to satisfy the condition that more representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives and assigns them to work in its three sales zones - Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis: 
  Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and given the other constraints, we can start by listing representatives who would work in Zone 2 based on the given options, and reason out which ones would work in Zone 3.
  
  Option A: Kim, Mahr (None of them can be in Zone 3 as both Parra and Tiao must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 2, so this option is incorrect)
  Option B: Kim, Tiao (If Tiao is in Zone 2, Udall will not be in Zone 2, which means he will be in Zone 3 along with Stuckey, thus this option is correct)
  Option C: Parra, Quinn (Both of them cannot be in Zone 3, so this option is incorrect)
  Option D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall (If Tiao is in Zone 2, Stuckey and Udall cannot be in Zone 2, so they must be in Zone 3, thus this option is correct)
  Option E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall (If Parra and Quinn are in either Zone 1 or Zone 2, there would not be enough sales representatives for Zone 3, thus this option is incorrect)
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - Three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  - There are at most three sales representatives working in each sales zone.
  - Since either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, it follows that the remaining sales representative (i.e., not assigned to Zone 1 or Zone 2) works in Zone 3.
  - We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, there are at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3. The remaining sales representatives must work in Zone 1 or Zone 2, but we don't know which ones.

Solutions:
  A: Kim, Mahr - This is not possible since there must be at least two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  B: Kim, Tiao - This is not possible since Tiao is already assigned to Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  C: Parra, Quinn - This is not possible since two sales representatives cannot make up the majority of the sales representatives in all three zones combined.
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This is not possible because Tiao is already assigned to a zone.
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - This is a possible solution. This assigns one sales representative to Zone 1, one to Zone 2, and four to Zone 3.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than Zone 2.
  - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  
Solutions:
  - Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3 since we need at least three sales representatives to work there.
  - Kim cannot work in Zone 3 since we cannot have both Tiao and Udall work in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, which implies that either both of them work in Zone 2 or Zone 3. But if both of them work in Zone 2 or Zone 3, we won't be able to fit in the other sales representatives (Parra or Tiao, and Tiao or Udall).
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, which implies that both of them work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  - Therefore, we must have Parra or Tiao in Zone 1, Tiao or Udall in Zone 2, and the rest of the sales representatives in Zone 3 (including Stuckey and Udall).
  - Among the given options, only D is a complete list that satisfies the constraints described above.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The software company has 3 sales zones and 7 sales representatives. 
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Elimination:
  A: Kim and Mahr are not mentioned to work in Zone 3. Eliminate A.
  B: Tiao is already assigned to Zone 1 and Udall may only work in Zone 2 if Tiao doesn't. Eliminate B.
  C: Parra and Quinn are in the same sales zone. If they were working in Zone 3, there would be no further sales representative available to work in Zones 1 and 2. Eliminate C.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 2. Stuckey and Udall must work in the same zone, so they are excluded. Eliminate D.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  Parra (or Tiao) is in Zone 1. Tiao (or Udall) is in Zone 2. Therefore, neither Tiao nor Udall is in Zone 1. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, four sales representatives must work in Zone 3, and three sales representatives work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2. There are three ways to form a group of three from (Parra, Tiao, and Udall), and none of the three groups can be assigned to Zone 2. Therefore, the group (Parra, Quinn, Stuckey and Udall) must be assigned to Zone 3. As a result, Kim and Mahr must be in the remaining two spots in Zone 1 or Zone 2.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

For solving this problem we can create a schedule table and follow the given conditions. After doing so, we can infer that if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch then it's not possible that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True)
B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (True)
C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False)
D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (True)
E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (True)

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. 
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. 
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Reasoning:
  Since one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, the possible scenarios are:
    1. Oatmeal 1 and Peanut 1 are made the same day as Sugar 3.
    2. Peanut 1 and Sugar 1 are made the same day as Oatmeal 3.
    3. Sugar 1 and Oatmeal 1 are made the same day as Peanut 3.
  We have to find the option that is NOT possible based on the above scenarios.

A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - This is possible in each of the scenarios, so it cannot be false.
B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - This is never possible because if the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then no batch of sugar cookies can be made on Wednesday because sugar cookies are made in three different batches only. Therefore, this option could be false.
C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - This is not true since we know at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and one of the scenarios has two batches made on Monday.
D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - This is not true since no two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day, and there are three types of cookies, so we cannot have two batches of cookies made on any single day.
E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - This is possible in each of the scenarios, so it cannot be false.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  2nd batch of oatmeal = 1st batch of peanut butter.
  2nd batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
  Let's assume that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of oatmeal cookies.
  Then that means the second batch of peanut butter cookies can only be made on Monday and the second batch of sugar cookies can only be made on Thursday.
  On Tuesday, we can only make one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, exactly one batch of cookie is made on Tuesday (not exactly two).
  The rest of the statements are still true, so the only one that could be false is D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Each week the bakery makes exactly 3 kinds of cookie, and makes 3 batches of each.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, in which cases would the information provided be false?
  - From the given conditions, we know that the batches on Monday consist only of the first batches of each of the three kinds of cookies.
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then that means that the batches on Monday must include the first batch of one of the kinds of cookie, and the third batch of another kind of cookie. 
  - There are only two kinds of cookies that will have their third batch made by Wednesday, and those are oatmeal and peanut butter cookies.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The statement that could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch is: "Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday."
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - It means The second batch of oatmeal cookies and the third batch of peanut butter cookies are made on the same day.
  - Therefore, the remaining first batches are for sugar cookies.
  - And the last oatmeal batch and the first sugar batch are made on Thursday, meaning the second sugar batch is on Friday.
  - Thus, all the days will have one or two batches of cookies.
  - Also, only on Monday, one batch of cookies is considered for each kind. 

Action: Answer("D") 
    Explanation: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (This is false because the conditions only allow for one or two batches of cookies per day, and we already know that the first batches (of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar) for each day are different.)
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - A total of 9 batches are made, 3 of each kind.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - Since there are exactly three batches of each kind of cookie and we know that a batch of cookies is made on Monday, we know that exactly one type of cookie is baked on Monday.
  - Since we know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, we know that the first and third batches of sugar cookies are made on Monday and Wednesday (in some order).
  - From the condition that "one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch," the only possibility is that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies, and this day must be either Wednesday or Friday.
  
Test of Each Answer:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - True, since there are 9 batches in total and no two of the same kind can be made on the same day.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - True, since either all three sugar cookies' batches or the first batch of peanut butter cookies and the second and third batches of oatmeal cookies are made on Wednesday, and the remaining batch can be made on the other day.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - False, since we know that either the first or third batch of sugar cookies is also made on Monday in addition to the batch made from the first type of cookies. 
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - True, since since there are 3 batches of each kind, and no two batches of the same kind can be made on the same day, two batches of different types of cookies must be made on Tuesday in order to fit all the batches into the five days.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - False, since we know that either the first or third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday in addition to the batch made from the third type of cookies.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 3 kinds of cookies - oatmeal, peanut butter and sugar.
  - Exactly 3 batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: 
If oatmeal's first batch is made on the same day as sugar's third batch, then both batches must be made on the same day. 
This limits the possible days on which these batches can be made as follows: 
- Oatmeal's 1st batch, Peanut Butter's 1st batch, and Sugar's 3rd batch must all be made on the same day.
- The earliest this can occur is Tuesday. 

Given this information, we can evaluate each statement:
A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - This is true, as each of the three types of cookies must be made exactly once per week, and at least one batch is made on Monday
B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - This must be true, as 3 batches will have been made by Tuesday and there are still 6 batches remaining that must be made by Friday.
C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - This is false, as at least two batches are necessarily made on Monday to satisfy the constraints of the problem.
D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - This is true, as if all 3 of Oatmeal's 1st batch, Peanut Butter's 1st batch, and Sugar's 3rd batch are made on Tuesday, this leaves exactly 2 batches of each type of cookie remaining for the final two days of the week.
E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - This is false, as at least one batch of cookies still needs to be made on Friday to satisfy the constraints of the problem.

Therefore, the answer is: Answer("C").
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Analysis:
  We need to consider which statement would be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, the possibilities are:
  - Oatmeal's first batch is made on Thursday and Sugar's third batch is also made on Thursday.
  - Sugar's first batch is made on Tuesday and Peanut Butter's third batch is also made on Tuesday.
  - Peanut Butter's first batch is made on Wednesday and Oatmeal's third batch is also made on Wednesday.
  In all these cases, at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days, so option A cannot be false.
  Considering the possibilities, at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday can be true in all of them.
  If Oatmeal's first batch is made on Thursday and Sugar's third batch is also made on Thursday, only one batch of cookie is made on Monday, so option C could be false.
  If Sugar's first batch is made on Tuesday and Peanut Butter's third batch is also made on Tuesday, two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, so option D could be false.
  If Peanut Butter's first batch is made on Wednesday and Oatmeal's third batch is also made on Wednesday, only one batch of cookie is made on Friday, so option E could be false.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
In total, there are three kinds of cookies, and three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
Each batch is made on a different day from the other two batches of the same type of cookie.
At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so it is possible that only one kind of cookie is made on Monday, or that all three kinds of cookies are made on Monday.
The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
If a kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, it means these two are made on Wednesday or Friday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - It is possible that all fifteen batches are made on just three days, so it is not necessarily true that at least one batch is made on each of the five days. Therefore, this choice could be false.
B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - If all batches are made on just three days, then it is possible that Wednesday is one of the days where no batches of cookies are made, hence at least two batches of cookies are not necessarily made on Wednesday. Therefore, this choice could be false.
C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - This choice could be true. It is possible that exactly one batch of a kind of cookie is made on Monday.
D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - This choice could be true. It is possible that exactly two batches of a kind of cookie are made on Tuesday.
E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - This choice could be true. It is possible that exactly one batch of a kind of cookie is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Three types of cookies - oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  2. Three batches of each cookie type are made each week.
  3. No two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day.
  4. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  5. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  6. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  Suppose the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then according to condition 5, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Monday. Then, the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, and the remaining batches are made on Tuesday and Thursday.
  
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, it means that the third batch of either peanut butter or sugar cookies is made on Friday. That batch of cookies cannot be made on Wednesday (as it is reserved for the second batch of sugar cookies), or on Thursday (as it is reserved for the second batch of oatmeal cookies). Hence, that batch of cookies must be made on Tuesday. This satisfies all the given conditions.
  
  Therefore, we conclude that all of the answer choices could be true. Hence the answer is "None of the above".

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
Choices:
  A: Quinn
  B: Ruiz
  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. 
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. 
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. 
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
To solve this problem, we'll use contrapositive reasoning:
- Smith is not a project member, so Taylor cannot be a project member. 
- Therefore, if we violate the contrapositive condition "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be", we will be able to determine the worker who must be a project member.

- Since Taylor cannot be a project member, we will violate the condition "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be" by not selecting Smith.
- Consequently, we can include Verma as a project member since we don't need to violate the condition "If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be."

Action: Answer("C") so Verma must be a project member.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Only three of the seven workers will be selected as project members, and one of these project members will be the project leader.
  - Quinn and Ruiz can only be members if they are leaders.
  - If Smith is a member, Taylor must also be a member.
  - If Wells is a member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis: 
  If Taylor is not a project member, it means Taylor is not selected. Therefore, we need to pick 3 people out of 6. From those 6, we remove Taylor. Then, we have 5 people to choose who should be 3 members and 1 leader. Since Quinn and Ruiz can only be members if they are leaders and Taylor is not there, Smith and Xue can not be leaders. But, we do not know whether Wells is selected or not. Thus, we will check Wells is selected or not based on the other constraints. If Wells is selected, neither Verma nor Ruiz can be selected, so we have Quinn, Wells, and one person from {Smith, Xue}. If Wells is not a member, then we have Ruiz, Quinn, and one person from {Smith, Xue}, because Verma can't be a member. Thus, we have two possibilities Quinn and Wells with Smith or Xue OR Ruiz and Quinn with Smith or Xue.

Action: Since Quinn must be a member in both cases, Answer("A") Quinn is the only worker who must be a project member.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  
Since Taylor is not a project member, we can rule out the possibility of choosing Smith as a project member. Therefore, Taylor cannot be selected with Smith as required. Thus, if we want to select exactly three workers, we have to choose Wells, and to comply with the constraint, we cannot choose Ruiz or Verma. We can either choose only Quinn or choose Quinn and Xue. In both cases, we can make Quinn a project leader. Therefore, the answer is A) Quinn.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The project must have 3 members, including a leader and there are 7 workers to choose from.
  Quinn and Ruiz can be members only if leading the project.
  Smith and Taylor must be members together.
  If Wells is a member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
  * If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  * That implies that the third member must be either Quinn, Ruiz, Verma or Wells.
  *  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members, and hence the third member must be either Quinn or Xue.
  * If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, they must be the leader. 
  * If Verma is a project member, then the leader must either be Quinn or Ruiz.
  * Therefore, in any case, one of Quinn, Ruiz, Verma or Wells must be a project member.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The project has three members, one of which is the project leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz are project members, then they must be the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz or Verma can be project members.
  
Analysis:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member. Thus, whichever project member is chosen cannot be Smith, but must be someone else. It follows that if Wells is one of the project members, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be on the project. Therefore, Quinn would be the only remaining project member who could be the project leader. Thus, Quinn and Wells will be two of the three project members, and the third must be someone who can be on the project with Wells and Quinn.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the leader.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected as project members, and exactly one out of these three will be the project leader.
  
Reasoning:
If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member since they must be selected together. This leaves 5 workers for the remaining 2 spots: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue. If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, which means that either Quinn or Xue must be the third project member, and they will also be the project leader (if they are selected). If Wells is not a project member, then either Ruiz or Verma can be. However, if Ruiz is the project member, they must be the project leader, which means that Verma could not be selected. Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then either Quinn or Xue must be a project member.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The special project will have exactly three workers and exactly one project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
If Taylor is not a project member, then it is impossible that Smith is also a project member. Therefore, we do not need to consider the third constraint. 

If Quinn is one of the project members, then Quinn must lead the project. However, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be the project members, so it is impossible for there to be 3 project members with Quinn leading. Therefore, we know that Quinn cannot be a project member.

If Ruiz is one of the project members, then Ruiz must lead the project. However, neither Verma nor Wells can be project members. If Taylor is not a project member, then it is possible for 3 project members to be selected: Ruiz as the leader, Wells, and Xue. Therefore, Ruiz can be a project member.

If Wells is one of the project members, then neither Verma nor Ruiz can be. If Taylor is not a project member, then it is possible for 3 project members to be selected: Wells as the leader, Xue, and Ruiz. Therefore, Wells can be a project member. 

Since Quinn cannot be a project member and both Ruiz and Wells can be, the only other worker that must be a project member is Xue. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly three workers will be selected for the project and one of them will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  - If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be selected.
  - If Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.

Since Taylor is not a project team member, Smith cannot be selected as well. This means that Wells cannot be selected either since neither Ruiz nor Verma could be part of the project in this case. We know that exactly three workers must be part of the project, and that Quinn or Ruiz need to be the project leader. Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be included in the project, and since Ruiz cannot be considered anymore, Quinn must be in it. This leaves us with only one more place for a team member, and that has to be Xue, which means that Verma cannot be in the project.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Only three workers can be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of the selected workers must be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Since Taylor can only be a project member if Smith is a project member and the number of project members is exactly three, neither Taylor nor Smith can be the project leader. Therefore, one of the remaining five workers must be the project leader.
If Taylor is not a project member, then the only way Smith could be a project member is for her to be the project leader. This means that Quinn or Ruiz must also be project members because only Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member if leading the project and only one person can be the project leader. If Wells is not a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members. Therefore, Wells must be a project member. This leaves us with Wells, Smith, and one of  Quinn or Ruiz being the three project members. The project leader will be either Quinn or Ruiz.

Action: Answer("A") 
Therefore, Quinn must be a project member.
Response 9:
If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member (given that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be). 

There are three positions available, and if neither Taylor nor Smith are project members, then the project leader and two project members must be chosen from the remaining five workers (Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue). 

We can break the remaining workers into two groups: Workers who can be project members only if leading the project (Quinn and Ruiz), and workers who can be project members regardless of whether they lead or not (Verma, Wells, and Xue). 

If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member (given that if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be). This means that the two other project members must be selected from the group consisting of Quinn, Taylor, and Xue. Since Taylor cannot be chosen, Quinn and Xue must be chosen as the other two project members. This means that neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be the project leader. 

If Verma is selected, then Quinn and Ruiz can be chosen as the other two members regardless of project leadership. However, one of Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, which is not possible since neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member unless leading the project. 

If Xue is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member (given that if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be). This means that the two other project members must be selected from the group consisting of Quinn, Smith, and Wells. Since Smith cannot be chosen, Quinn and Wells must be chosen as the other two project members. Again, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be the project leader. 

Therefore, of the workers that are left, the only worker who can be a project member regardless of whether they lead or not and who can be a member without conflicting constraints is Xue (option E).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Veqemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon
  C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy
  D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than, wellspring
  E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The six slots at the benefit concert are numbered from one to six. They will be filled by six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Veqemite performs in slot three, the order of the bands' performances might be.<br> 1) Yardsign, Wellspring, Vegemite, Zircon, Xpert, Uneasy or 2) Wellspring, Yardsign, Vegemite, Zircon, Xpert, Uneasy
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- 6 bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will fill 6 slots numbered 1 to 6.
- Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. 
- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
- Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
- Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Action: 
  - If Vegemite performs in slot 3, then either Wellspring/Zircon or Xpert will perform in slot 6, as Vegemite performs earlier than Zircon (Constraint 1);  
  -  Yardsign will perform in slot 1 or 2, as it should perform in one of the first three slots (Constraint 4);
  - Uneasy will perform in slot 4, 5, or 6, as it should perform in one of the last three slots (Constraint 3);
  - As only one slot will be left between slots 4, 5, or 6 and slot 3 where Vegemite performs, Wellspring/Zircon will perform in slot 6, which means they will perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy, and option A) is true. 
  - Option B is false because Wellspring/Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite (Constraint 1);
  - Option C is false because Xpert performs in a later slot than Wellspring/Zircon and Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite (Constraints 1 and 2);
  - Option D is false because Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, whereas Wellspring/Zircon performs in slot 6 (Constraint 4);
  - Option E is false as Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite (Contraint 1).
  
Therefore, the answer is A) Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform in six distinct slots numbered one through six, earliest to latest.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring & Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
  Constraints:
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two, in some order. 
  - Yardsign, therefore, must perform in slot three, and Uneasy must perform in one of slots four, five, or six.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Vegemite performs earlier than Zircon
  - Wellspring and Zircon performs earlier than Xpert
  - Uneasy performs in the last three slots
  - Yardsign performs in the first three slots
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign cannot be in slot one or two.

Analysis:
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or two. 
  - If Uneasy performs in the last three slots and Yardsign performs in slot one or two, then it is possible that Uneasy performs after Yardsign.
  - Wellspring and Zircon must perform before Xpert
  - There's no direct relationship between the performance of Zircon and Uneasy given slot three is already occupied.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are six slots named slot one through slot six.
  Six bands—I, V, W, X, Y, and Z—each perform in just one slot.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Veqemite performs in slot three
    - bands in slot 1 and 2 can be only from Y, V, and W
    - the same way, bands in slot 4 to 6 can be only from U, X, and Z

Analysis: 
Since Vegemite is slotted into slot three, we can conclude that Yardsign and an unknown slot fill slots one and two, and Uneasy and two unknown bands fill slots four, five, and six. The question asks which statement must be true based on the above constraints.

A) If Uneasy fills one of the last two slots, it is possible that Xpert fills an earlier slot, making A false.
B) Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so we do not know if it is earlier than or equal to slot three, making B false.
C) Xpert could not fill an earlier slot than Vegemite since slot one and two belong to two of the three possible early bands, making C false.
D) We do not know if Wellspring or Zircon fills slots one or two, making D indeterminate.
E) Zircon must fill either slot four, five or six along with Uneasy, making E true.

Action: Answer ("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform in the six slots numbered 1 through 6.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots
  - If Vegemite performs in slot three, some of the slots are already filled
    V__Z__
    Y____
    ____X
    Other bands need to be placed in the remaining slots following the rules.
    
Analysis:
  - Vegemite occupies slot 3, so we know that Zircon occupies a later slot.
  - Yardsign must occupy a slot in the first three, so the possible slots for Yardsign are 1 and 2.
  -  Slots 4, 5, and 6 are available for Uneasy to occupy.
  - Since Zircon needs to occupy a slot earlier than Xpert and Xpert cannot be in position 1 or 2, Xpert must occupy slot 5 or 6, which forces Wellspring to occupy slot 4.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
Therefore, if Vegemite performs in position 3, the correct answer is A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. 
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  Slot one is the earliest slot, and slot six is the latest slot.
  A band performs in just one slot.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The six slots of the concert are numbered from one to six.
  - The slots will be filled by the six bands - Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
 
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, we can infer that Zircon has to perform in a later slot, either in slot five or six. And it is also clear that Wellspring certainly performs in slot two with Vegemite performing in three, leaving Yardsign to perform in slot one, based on the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Then, we can know that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. From this, we can conclude:
Action: Answer("D") Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The slots are numbered 1 through 6, from the earliest to latest.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Veqemite performs in slot three,  Wellspring, Zircon, and Xpert all perform after Veqemite.
  
  A: We do not know where Uneasy will perform relative to Xpert.
  B: Since Xpert performs after Zircon, Wellspring also performs before Zircon. If Zircon is performing after Veqemite, then Wellspring cannot perform in an earlier slot than Zircon. This choice is false.
  C: Xpert performs after Veqemite, so it cannot perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy. This choice is false.
  D: We do not know where Wellspring will perform relative to Yardsign.
  E: This is true since Vegemite performs before Zircon and Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Therefore, Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy, which fits this choice.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We have six slots numbered one through six and six bands - Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  The constraints are:
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

Analysis:
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, we know that Zircon has to perform in one of the last three slots. Vegemite has to perform in an earlier slot than Zircon. So, Zircon has to perform in either slot five or slot six. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, if Zircon performs in slot five, Wellspring has to perform in slot four, and Xpert has to perform in slot six. If Zircon performs in slot six, Wellspring has to perform in slot four, and Xpert has to perform in slot five. Either way, Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Hence, the answer is:

Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Seven individuals were recruited by the criminal.
- The accomplices were recruited one at a time.
- Peters was the fourth recruit.
- Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White.
- Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.

Explanation:
- Since Peters was the fourth recruit, and six other individuals, including White and Rovero, were recruited after Peters, we know that White must be one of the last two recruits.
- Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, then Villas must be the other one of (and therefore was also among) the last two recruits.
- Therefore, Rovero must have been among the earlier five recruits. Further, by one of the preceding observations, Quinn must be one of the earlier four recruits.
- Next, consider Stanton. Since neither he nor Tao were recruited immediately before or after each other, and since we have already identified five of the recruits as Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, and Rovero, Stanton must be the only remaining individual, who was recruited third. Finally, Tao was recruited last.

Action: Answer("D") - Tao was recruited sixth.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  According to the information given:
  Peters - 4th position
  Quinn < Rovero
  Villas < White
  Stanton <> Tao
  Rovero < Tao and White
  
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero, then White was not recruited at 7th position, which means Rovero was recruited at 7th position.
  As Quinn is recruited earlier than Rovero, he should be recruited before position 6; hence either he should be in 1st or 2nd position.
  And as Villas was immediately before White, Villas should be at 6th position.
  Now, since Stanton was neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao and Tao was recruited after Rovero, which means Tao was recruited at 5th position and Stanton was recruited at 2nd position.
  Therefore, the possible answer is Option C i.e. Stanton was recruited second.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  White was recruited after Villas.
  Rovero was recruited after White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Process of Elimination:
- Option A is impossible, because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero and Peters. Therefore, Quinn could not be recruited first.
- Option B is possible. If Rovero was recruited third, then the order could be Peters > Quinn > Rovero > Villas > White > Stanton > Tao.
- Option C is impossible, because Stanton was not recruited immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Also, Peters was recruited fourth.
- Option D is impossible, because Tao was recruited after Rovero.
- Option E is impossible, because Villas was recruited earlier than White.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
   We know that seven people were recruited one at a time by a criminal. We are given the following information:
    - Stanton was not recruited before or after Tao.
    - Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
    - Peters was recruited fourth.
    - Villas was recruited right before White.
    - And finally, we are given that if White was recruited before Rovero and Rovero was recruited before Tao, which of the following scenarios could be possible.
Action: 
     We can determine that Quinn couldn't have been recruited first as per the given info. Peters was recruited fourth, thus could NOT be before Rovero. Based on Villas' being recruited immediately before White, and White being recruited before Rovero, we can also infer that Villas cannot be recruited sixth. Therefore, the possible answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth. So, Answer("D").
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The suspect recruited seven accomplices: Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
- Each accomplice was recruited one at a time.
- Stanton was not recruited directly before or after Tao.
- Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White.
- Peters was recruited fourth.
- White was recruited before Rovero.
- Rovero was recruited before Tao.

Analysis:
- Since Peters was recruited fourth, the order of those recruited before Peters would be Quinn, followed by Rovero and then one other person.
- Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, the order of those recruited after Peters would be White, followed by Villas and then two other people.
- We are also told that White was recruited before Rovero, and Rovero was recruited before Tao.

Actions: 
- From these observations, we can determine that Quinn was the first to be recruited; thus, A cannot be true.
- We also know that Rovero was recruited third, meaning that answer choice B is correct.
- We cannot say for sure whether Stanton was recruited second, and we know that Tao was not recruited sixth, eliminating answer choices C and D.
- Villas being recruited sixth would violate the previously established order, so that means answer choice E is also false.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: Rovero was recruited third.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  
Solution:
- Since Peters was recruited fourth, then we know the order for the first four recruitments: _ _ _ P _ _ _.
- Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, then the order for the last three recruitment must be W V _.
- Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, there are two possibilities for their order: QR and RQ
- Since White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order must be: W V R T.
- Thus, the first two recruits must be Q and S in some order. There are two possibilities in this case, QS and SQ.

Answer: D: Tao was recruited sixth. (since the first two recruits must be Q and S in some order, then Tao cannot be recruited earlier than the sixth recruitment).
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  4. Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  5. The criminal recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  6. Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  7. White was recruited earlier than Rovero.

Solution:
  From 6 and 7, we know that the order of recruitment for White, Rovero, and Tao is: White, Rovero, Tao.
  From 3, we know that Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  We also know that Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  Therefore, the remaining recruits were Quinn and Stanton and we can consider the possible order of their recruitments.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero would have been recruited immediately after Quinn. Therefore, B is not possible.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao would have been recruited third by Rule 4. Then, Rovero would have been recruited fourth. Then White and Villas would be recruited 5th and 6th, but this order is not consistent with the order we derived from 6 and 7. Therefore, C is not possible.
  If Tao was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would have been: Quinn, Villas, Peters, Rovero, Stanton, White, Tau. But, this order is not consistent with the order we derived from 6 and 7. Therefore, D is not possible.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then White would have been recruited fifth, and this is not consistent with fact #5. Therefore, E is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible option is A which is Quinn was recruited first.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the first three is unknown.
  - Stanton was not adjacent to Tao, which means that:
      - If Stanton was recruited first, Tao was recruited fifth or later.
      - If Stanton was recruited seventh, Tao was recruited second or earlier.
  - Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao:
      - White and Rovero could be recruited in any order.
      - Tao must be either 6th or 7th.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Since Tao is 6th, there are only two possibilities for the order of the first five accomplices: Quinn - Villas - Peters - White - Rovero or Villas - Quinn - Peters - White - Rovero. In the first order, Rovero is recruited fifth, so he cannot be recruited earlier than White. In the second order, Rovero is recruited last, which fits the condition that Rovero was recruited later than White. Therefore, Tao must be recruited sixth and Rovero must be recruited earlier than Tao, which means that Tao could be recruited only as the seventh. Therefore, the only answer choice that could be true is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
  Analysis of the information given:
  We know that Peters was fourth, meaning that the recruitment order must begin with either Quinn or Villas. If Villas was indeed recruited before White, then Villas must be either first, second, or third (to be immediately before White). If Villas was third, then White and Rovero must be fourth and fifth in some order, which is impossible given that Rovero must be earlier than Tao. So, Villas must be first or second, meaning that White and Rovero are fourth and fifth (in some order) and Tao must be third. That leaves Quinn and Stanton for the last two spots, but we know that Quinn was recruited before Rovero, meaning that Quinn must be sixth and Stanton must be seventh.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Possible orders of recruitment based on the information:
1. Peters, Quinn, Villas, **Peters**, Rovero, White, Stanton, Tao
2. Peters, Quinn, Villas, **Peters**, Rovero, Stanton, White, Tao 
3. Quinn, Peters, Villas, **Peters**, Rovero, White, Stanton, Tao 
4. Quinn, Peters, Villas, **Peters**, Rovero, Stanton, White, Tao 

Knowledge:
  A: It is possible that Quinn was recruited first, but not necessary based on the given information.
  B: It is possible that Rovero was recruited third as long as Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  C: Stanton must have been recruited either first, second, fifth, or seventh, which is not consistent with this order.
  D: It is possible that Tao was recruited sixth as long as White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  E: It is not consistent with the given information, because Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited earlier than White.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
First we can use the rule "F is placed on the same shelf as M" along with the fact that each shelf has at least two books to conclude that F and M are on the same shelf. We don't know which shelf they are on, but it means we can eliminate choices C and E because neither of these include both F and M. 

Next, by the rule "More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf", we can eliminate choices A and B because neither of these have more books on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. 

So now we are left with only choice D, "F, G, M, O", which has four books on the bottom shelf (F, G, M, O), which fits the requirement of having more books on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf
  - I is placed on the middle shelf
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M
Logic:
  - We don't know which books belong on which shelf, but we know that F and M are together on one shelf
  - Since there are at least two books per shelf and I is on the middle shelf, one of the remaining shelves (top or bottom) has only 2 books and the other has 3
  - Since the bottom shelf has more books than the top, the bottom shelf has 3 books
  - K is on a shelf higher than F, so K is not on the bottom shelf
  - Likewise, O is on a shelf higher than L, so O and L are not on the bottom shelf
  - G and H are not on the same shelf as I because each shelf can have at most 3 books, so G and H are not on the middle shelf, and since I is not on the bottom shelf, G and H must be on the top shelf
  - Based on the above deductions, the possible bottom shelf books are F, M, and either G or H
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Let's analyze each option:
  A: F, M. Since more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, this option is not possible because only 2 books would be on the bottom shelf.
  B: F, H, M. This option is not possible because H is not located on the bottom shelf, but we need at least two books on the bottom shelf.
  C: G, H, K. This option is not possible because I needs to be on the middle shelf.
  D: F, G, M, O. This option is possible. F and M are on the same shelf, and G and O must be on a higher shelf than the middle shelf, so they go on the top shelf, while F and M go on the bottom shelf.
  E: G, H, L, M. This option is not possible because O must be on a higher shelf than L.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The number of books is even, and there are exactly eight books.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Elimination:
  A: According to the conditions, there must be more than two books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, A is not correct.
  B: H is placed on the middle shelf and K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, B is not correct. 
  C: There is no overlapping between G, H, K and the conditions. Therefore, C is not correct.
  D: This option is consistent with the provided conditions. So, it is a possible valid configuration and could be the answer.
  E: L is not placed on the bottom shelf and K is not placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, E is not correct.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least 4 books on the bottom shelf.
  2. I is placed on the middle shelf.
  3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Using condition 5 (F is placed on the same shelf as M), we know that F and M are on either the top shelf or the bottom shelf. 

Using condition 2 (I is placed on the middle shelf), we know that I is not on the same shelf as F or M. Therefore, I is on the top shelf.

Using condition 3 (K is placed on a higher shelf than F), we know that K cannot be on the same shelf as F or M. Therefore, K is on the top shelf and both F and M are on the bottom shelf.

Using condition 4 (O is placed on a higher shelf than L), we know that O is not on the same shelf as L. Therefore, L is on the bottom shelf.

The remaining books (G and H) must be placed on the middle shelf.

So, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf is: F, M, and L.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  F is on the same shelf as M.
  At least two books should be on each shelf.

Elimination: 
  A: Cannot be the answer because there must be more than two books on the bottom shelf
  B: Can't be true because besides F and M, there must be at least one more book on the bottom shelf.
  C: Can't be true because none of these books are placed on a higher shelf than any of the other books listed.
  D: Could be true because it meets all of the requirements. 
  E: Can't be true because L is placed on a higher shelf than M, and the question states F and M are put on the same shelf.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
  - There are at least 2 books on each shelf
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Recall that there must be more than 2 books on each shelf, so there are either 3 or 4 books in the bottom shelf. I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be in the bottom shelf. K is on a higher shelf than F, so neither F nor K can be in the bottom shelf. O is on a higher shelf than L, so neither L nor O can be in the bottom shelf. Therefore, the books in the bottom shelf must be some combination of G, H, and M.

Checking the answer choices:
 A. F and M can't be on the bottom shelf, as there must be at least 3 books in the bottom shelf.
 B. F and M can be in the bottom shelf, but choice B doesn't include a third book for the bottom shelf.
 C. None of the books can be in the bottom shelf, as all of them would be on the middle or top shelf according to this option.
 D. F, G, M, and O can't be on the bottom shelf, because there can't be more than four books in the bottom shelf. 
 E. G, H, L, and M can't be placed on the same shelf as there wouldn't be enough space.

Action: Answer("B") 
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 books, which means 2 shelves have 3 books and 1 shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Solutions:
  - From K is placed on a higher shelf than F., it can be inferred that K is not on the bottom shelf and F is not on the top shelf.
  - From I is placed on the middle shelf., it can be inferred that I is the book in the middle of the middle shelf.
  - From F is placed on the same shelf as M., it can be inferred that F and M are on the same shelf.

  As a result, there are only 3 books remaining that can be placed on the bottom shelf: H, G, O.

  Only one of the options below includes these remaining books:
  A: F, M                        - This option doesn't have any of these remaining books.
  B: F, H, M                     - This option includes H and M, but doesn't have O and G.
  C: G, H, K                     - This option includes G and H, but doesn't have O; Also, K cannot be on the bottom shelf because it's placed on a higher shelf than F.
  D: F, G, M, O                  - This option includes all the remaining books (H, G, O, and M) and satisfies all the requirements, so it could be a complete and accurate list of books placed on the bottom shelf.
  E: G, H, L, M                  - This option includes H and M, but doesn't have O and G.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- There are 3 shelves. More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Based on the given conditions, we know that 3 or more books must be placed on the bottom shelf. Since both K and O are on higher shelves, neither of them can be on the bottom shelf. Thus, there are two scenarios for placing the books on the bottom shelf:
1. F and M are placed on the bottom shelf together with at least one other book.
2. F, H, and M are placed on the bottom shelf.

Option A cannot be correct because it only includes two books.
Option B can be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf.
Option C cannot be correct because it does not include F or M. 
Option D cannot be correct because it includes O, which cannot be placed on the bottom shelf. 
Option E cannot be correct because it includes L, which cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Analysis:
  We know that the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf and we need to find a list of books in the bottom shelf. From the given options, only option B and D have F in the list of books which are placed on the bottom shelf. However, option D has more books than option B, which goes with the given condition that the bottom shelf should have "at least" two books. Therefore, option D is the answer.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year will be published.
  Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions:
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring

Action: Answer("D")  
If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring has the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks as the original condition because M and N must be in different seasons. If N is published in the spring, according to the original condition, M must be in the fall, and according to this substitution, M must also be in the spring.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are six cookbooks to be published: K, L, M, N, O, and P
  Each cookbook will be published in 1 of 2 seasons: fall or spring
  M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  According to the initial conditions, if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. 
  This means if M is published in the fall, we know that N must be published in the spring. Therefore, D is correct since it says "If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring." This has the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks as the initial condition.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The condition is that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  A: L has no mentioned relationship with M or N.
  B: N has a relationship with K, and P has a relationship with M. These two are independent of each other and don't affect the relationship between M and N.
  C: M and P cannot be published in the same season. This is a separate independent condition that is not related to M and N.
  D: This is equivalent to the given condition.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This doesn't relate to M and N and doesn't affect the relationship between them.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
    This is a conditional statement that limits the conditions for when M and N can be published relative to each other.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
    This statement has no effect on the conditions for when M and N can be published relative to each other, and thus cannot replace the original condition given.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
    This statement has no effect on the conditions for when M and N can be published relative to each other, and thus cannot replace the original condition given.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
    This statement has no effect on the conditions for when M and N can be published relative to each other, and thus cannot replace the original condition given.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
    This statement is the exact opposite of the original condition given, but it still limits the conditions for when M and N can be published relative to each other.
  E: If O is published in the spring, N must be published in the spring.
    This statement has no effect on the conditions for when M and N can be published relative to each other, and thus cannot replace the original condition given.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are six cookbooks: K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  There are two seasons: fall and spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  The question is asking for a substitution that would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
- K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
- If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
- If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

Action: Answer("D")

If N is published in the spring, it would be in a different season than M, which would mean that M and P are not in the same season. However, the conditions for K and O are undetermined by this statement. Therefore, this satisfies the requirements for providing the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 cookbooks that will be published in either the fall or spring season.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season.
  K and N must be published in the same season.
  If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring.
  
Action: 
  The correct answer must give an equivalent scheduling condition to M being published in the fall and N being published in the spring. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and C because they do not involve M being published in the fall. Option E only involves O and N and does not involve M at all. So the correct answer is D, which provides an equivalent scheduling condition. If N is published in the spring, then M must also be published in the spring. Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
A: This new condition would not have the same effect since it involves L and M, not M and N.
B: This new condition would not have the same effect since it involves N and P, not M and N.
C: This new condition would have a different effect on the schedule.
D: This new condition would have the same effect since it involves M and N; it has the same meaning as the original condition.
E: This new condition would not have the same effect since it involves O and N, not M and N.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The condition is that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring is not the same as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. 
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall is not the same as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. 
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall is not the same as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. 
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring is not the same as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. 
  E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring is not the same as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are six cookbooks: K, L, M, N, O, P.
  Two seasons: fall and spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
  
Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation:
  The original condition, "If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring," creates a link between M and N that applies only when M is published in the fall. This means that N must be published in the spring if M is published in the fall, but there is no requirement for N if M is published in the spring or if M is not published at all. To maintain an equivalent link between M and N, we need a new condition that creates a link between M and N that applies no matter when M is published.  
  (A) and (B) introduce new requirements that have no connection to M and N.
  (C) creates a link between M and P that is not present in the original problem.
  (D) substitutes a statement with the same meaning as the original. If N is published in the spring, M must have been published earlier, and M cannot have been published in the fall. 
  (E) creates a link between O and N that has no connection with M.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are 4 walls and each wall has an upper position and a lower position.
  Each student is displaying exactly one oil painting and one watercolor painting.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, there are 2 possible ways to arrange the paintings on walls 1 and 4.
  One possible arrangement is:
    Wall 1: Hidalgo's oil in the upper position and Greene's watercolor in the lower position
    Wall 4: Isaacs's oil in the lower position and Hidalgo's watercolor in the upper position
  Another possible arrangement is:
    Wall 1: Greene's oil in the upper position and Hidalgo's watercolor in the lower position
    Wall 4: Isaacs's oil in the lower position and Greene's watercolor in the upper position

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Each of the four walls displays exactly two paintings (an oil and a watercolor) and no wall can have only watercolors. Therefore, each wall must have exactly one oil and one watercolor painting.
  Neither wall 1 nor wall 4 can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.

If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then the paintings for wall 1 and wall 4 can be determined as follows:
- Wall 2: Isaacs's watercolor and ???
- Wall 3: Franz's oil and ???
- Wall 4: Isaacs's oil and ???
- Wall 1: ??? and Greene's watercolor (because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed)

There are three students (Franz, Greene, and Hidalgo) who still need to have one oil and one watercolor painting displayed, and there are two walls (1 and 4) where these paintings can be displayed. Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, each wall must have a painting from two different students. Also, since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, each wall must have one oil painting and one watercolor painting.

Notice that Greene's watercolor has already been placed on wall 1, and no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, wall 1 cannot have a painting by Isaacs or Franz displayed on it. This means that wall 1 must have Hidalgo's oil or Hidalgo's watercolor displayed on it.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Walls 1 and 3 do not have the work of only one student displayed on them.
  2. Franz does not have any work displayed on the same wall as Isaacs.
  3. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  4. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  5. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  6. Each wall has exactly two paintings, an oil and a watercolor.

If Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 2 and Franz's oil is on wall 3, the only way to follow conditions 1, 2, and 6 is to have Greene's oil and watercolor on the same wall other than wall 4. From condition 3, we know that Franz's oil has to be on either wall 1 or wall 3, but since Isaacs cannot be on the same wall as Franz, Isaacs' two paintings will be on walls 2 and 4. Hidalgo's two paintings must be on walls 1 and 3, but we do not know which painting goes where. Thus, to satisfy all conditions, Greene's oil must be on wall 1 (since it cannot be on wall 3 with Franz's oil) and Greene's watercolor must be on wall 4 (since it must be on the same wall as Franz's oil). Therefore, the answer is choice B: Greene's oil. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Each of the four walls has one upper and one lower painting.
  2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed.
  3. No wall has only watercolors displayed.
  4. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed.

From the given information:
- Franz exhibits an oil on Wall 3.
- Isaacs exhibits an oil on the lower position of Wall 4.
- Isaacs exhibits a watercolor on Wall 2.

This implies that:
- Greene exhibits a watercolor on the upper position of Wall 3 since it is the only possibility left for Wall 3.
- Greene cannot exhibit on Wall 4 because otherwise, the display will contain both Isaacs's and Franz's paintings.
- Greene cannot exhibit on Wall 2 because his watercolor is already displayed on Wall 3.
- Hidalgo must exhibit on Wall 1.

Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor (cannot be displayed on Wall 1 because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and Isaacs)
  B: Greene's oil (cannot be displayed on Wall 1 because it does not comply with the conditions)
  C: Greene's watercolor (cannot be displayed on Wall 1 because Greene's watercolor is already displayed on Wall 3)
  D: Hidalgo's oil (can be displayed on Wall 1 because Hidalgo is the only student left, based on the previous deductions)
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor (cannot be displayed on Wall 1 because no wall can have only watercolors) 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Each wall will have exactly 2 paintings - one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  2. No wall can have only watercolors.
  3. No wall can have paintings by only one student.
  4. No wall can have paintings by both Franz and Isaacs.
  5. Greene’s watercolor is on the wall with Franz’s oil in the upper position.
  6. Isaacs’s oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
From the given information, we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4. So, the watercolor painted by Isaacs cannot be displayed on the same wall. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2. If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then wall 3 cannot have Franz's watercolor because it will be violating the given condition that no wall will have both paintings by Franz and Isaacs. Also, since the watercolor of Isaacs is already displayed on wall 2, it cannot be displayed again, so Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 or 4 either. Therefore, the only possibility left is that wall 1 must have one of Hidalgo's paintings. As we have no other information about Hidalgo's paintings, we cannot determine which one of Hidalgo's paintings (oil or watercolor) must be on wall 1. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are four art students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs
  Each student displays exactly two paintings, one oil, and one watercolor
  Exactly two paintings displayed on each of the walls (1, 2, 3, and 4)
  One painting is in the upper position and one in the lower position on each wall
  No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position on the wall that Franz's oil is displayed on
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: According to the given information, no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Also, no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, neither Franz's watercolor nor Isaacs's oil can be displayed on wall 1. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position on the wall that Franz's oil is displayed on, so Greene's oil must be on either wall 1 or wall 2. Rule out wall 2 since it already has Isaacs's watercolor. Thus Hidalgo's  oil must be on wall 1. Therefore, the answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1- Each student displays exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor.
  2- Exactly two paintings are displayed on each of the walls.
  3- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  4- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  5- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  6- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  7- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  8- Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  
Analysis: 
  - Wall 4 has Isaacs's oil.
  - Therefore, Wall 4 has a painting by Isaacs and one other student.
  - As no wall can have more than one painting from Isaacs or Franz, Wall 4 has one painting from Isaacs and one from either Greene or Hidalgo.
  - Based on condition 6, the wall with Greene's watercolor must have a painting by Franz.
  - Therefore, Wall 2 has a painting by Hidalgo and one by Franz.
  - Wall 1 has the paintings by Greene and Isaacs. That leaves Hidalgo's oil painting for Wall 3.
Answer:
  Action: Answer("D") 
  The painting that must be displayed on wall 1 is Hidalgo's oil.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are four walls in the exhibition room, and each wall displays two paintings (one in the upper position, and one in the lower position).
  Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four students, and each student displays two paintings (one oil and one watercolor).
  The position of each painting is specified (oil or watercolor, upper or lower position) and some of them are assigned to specific walls.
  We have to use the given information to determine what painting has to be displayed in a specific position on a specific wall.
  
We are given that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3. To determine what painting must be displayed on wall 1, we can start by looking at the given conditions that could restrict the paintings that can be displayed on wall 1. According to the conditions:
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
We know that Isaacs's watercolor is already displayed on wall 2, and Franz's oil is already displayed on wall 3. Therefore, neither of these paintings can be displayed on wall 1. This eliminates options A and C. We also know that each wall must have one oil and one watercolor painting, so we need to determine which of the remaining three paintings (Greene's oil, Hidalgo's oil, and Hidalgo's watercolor) can be displayed on wall 1 without violating any of the conditions. At this point, we can use trial and error or logical deduction. 

Option B: If Greene's oil is displayed on wall 1, then wall 3 must have Hidalgo's watercolor, wall 2 must have Isaacs's oil, and wall 4 must have Greene's watercolor. However, this configuration violates the condition that no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.

Option D: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 1, then wall 3 must have Greene's watercolor, wall 2 must have Isaacs's oil, and wall 4 must have Hidalgo's watercolor. However, this configuration violates the condition that no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.

Option E: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on wall 1, then wall 3 must have Greene's oil, wall 2 must have Isaacs's oil, and wall 4 must have Greene's watercolor. This configuration satisfies all the conditions and is therefore the correct answer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- Each of the four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
- Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
- Isaacs’s watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.

Using the given information, we can conclude that wall 4 must have Hidalgo's paintings since it is the only wall left that has not been determined yet. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 4 since we already know that Isaacs's oil is displayed on the lower position of wall 4. We also know from the given information that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, neither of Franz's paintings can be on wall 4 where Isaacs's oil is displayed. This implies that Franz's paintings must be displayed on either walls 1 or 2. We also know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must also be on that wall, which means Franz's watercolor and Hidalgo's watercolor must be on walls 1 and 2. 

Action: Answer("A") 
Therefore, we can conclude that the painting that must be displayed on wall 1 is Franz's watercolor (choice A).
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Franz, Greene, Hidalgo and Isaacs are four art students who will each display two paintings at an exhibition.
  Each wall will have exactly two paintings displayed on it, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("D")
If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's oil has to be displayed on wall 1. This is because Greene would have to have a watercolor painting on Wall 1, but there cannot be a wall with only one student's work on it, so Greene must have an oil painting on wall 1 as well. Hidalgo's oil must be on wall 2 because if Hidalgo's watercolor was on Wall 2, then watercolors would be on all four walls. Therefore, the only option is Hidalgo's watercolor being displayed on wall 4, which leaves Hidalgo's oil to be displayed on Wall 1. Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are 8 students in total: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
- Exactly 6 students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- Exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
- Olivia and Robert can't give afternoon reports.
- If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports the next day unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Action:
- From the given conditions, we know that George will give a report on Tuesday and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. That means both will have to give a report in the morning, one on Monday and one on Wednesday.
- That leaves us with three students who need to give a report: Helen, Irving, and Nina. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving have to give their report the next day unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- Let's see if the choices are feasible:
  - A: If Helen gives a report on Wednesday, either Irving or Nina would have to give their report in the morning of Wednesday, and that's not possible because Nina can't give a report in the morning if she's already given a report before.
  - B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, either Helen or Irving would have to give their report on Tuesday along with George. However, we already know that Helen and Irving can't give their report on the same day. This is not possible.
  - C: Since George will give his report on Tuesday, Nina can't give hers on Tuesday. If she gives hers on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving would have to give theirs on Monday. So, this is possible.
  - D: Olivia can't give a report in the afternoon, so this is not possible.
  - E: Robert is giving his report in the morning session, so this is not possible.

Therefore, the answer is C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  * Eight students will give oral reports during 3 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). Each day includes one morning and one afternoon report.
  * George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  * Olivia and Robert can not give afternoon reports.
  * If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after Nina) Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
Analysis:
  * George can only give a report on Tuesday => either Nina or Robert will give the other Tuesday report.
  * If Nina give a report and it is not given on Wednesday => Helen and Irving have to give reports on the next day of Nina's report. Thus, George and either Robert or Olivia's report will be given on the remaining  day.
  * If Robert gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. However, this is not possible since George must give his report on Tuesday. Thus, Nina must give a report on Monday if Robert does not.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report on any day, Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Analysis:
- If George, Nina, and Robert give reports, then none of them can give a report on the same day.
- If either Nina or Robert gives a report on Monday, then both Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which violates the condition that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If either Nina or Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Thursday, which is not possible since there are only three consecutive days for the oral reports.

Action: Answer("A")  
If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina and Robert cannot give a report on the same day. This means that Nina and Robert must give a report on Monday and Wednesday, in either order. Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and since they cannot both give morning reports, one of them must give an afternoon report. Therefore, Helen could give a report on Wednesday.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The seminar has eight students who will give six oral reports over three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Two reports will be given each day.
  George gives a report only on Tuesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
  
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, then:
    1. George gives his report on Tuesday
    2. Nina's report is not on Tuesday
    3. Robert's report is not on Tuesday and is not the last report on Wednesday.
  
  A: There is only one report on Wednesday and it cannot be Robert.
  B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving would have to give a report on Tuesday, which is not allowed according to the conditions.
  C: Nina could give a report on Tuesday with George, but Robert's report would have to be on Wednesday, which is not allowed according to the conditions.
  D: Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so this is not possible.
  E: Robert's report cannot be last and it cannot be on Tuesday. He can only give the first report on Monday or the second report on Wednesday.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 8 students in total in the seminar.
  - Exactly 6 of them will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly 2 reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  
  George has to give a report on Tuesday. If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, if George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, Nina must give her report on Monday or Wednesday.
  
  A: If Helen gives a report on Wednesday, then George must give his report on Monday or Nina must give her report on Wednesday. That would not be possible as George has to give his report on Tuesday and Nina cannot give hers on Wednesday.
  B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then George must give his report on Tuesday and Robert cannot give his report on Monday. Also, Helen and Irving cannot give their reports on Tuesday. Therefore, this scenario would not be possible.
  C: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then George must give his report on Monday and Robert cannot give his report on Tuesday. Also, Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. Therefore, this is not possible.
  D: If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then George must give his report on Tuesday and Robert cannot give his report on Monday. Also, Helen and Irving cannot give their reports on Tuesday. Therefore, this scenario would not be possible.
  E: If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then George must give his report on Monday and Nina cannot give her report on Wednesday. Also, Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. Therefore, this scenario would not be possible.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 students who will give 6 individual oral reports during 3 consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  - Exactly 2 reports will be given each day, one in morning and one in the afternoon.
  - On Tuesday, George must give a report.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving both must give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

From the conditions given, we can see that:
  - George must give his report on Tuesday.
  - If Nina gives report on Monday, then on Tuesday Helen and Irving both must give reports.
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give afternoon report so all of them will give their report in the morning.

Now, let's check the given options:
  A: If Helen gives a report on Wednesday, then 3 students should give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible.
  B: Nina cannot give a report on Monday as it will directly lead to contradiction with the given conditions mentioned above.
  C: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then on Wednesday, Helen and Irving both must give reports, which is possible and satisfies all the given conditions.
  D: Olivia cannot give her report on Monday as she cannot give the afternoon report.
  E: Robert cannot give his report on Wednesday as he cannot give the afternoon report.

So, the answer is C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday. Answer("C").
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Six out of eight students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
  - Two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. 
  - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. 
  - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Analysis:
 - Since there are also 3 pairs of morning and afternoon slots, which are going to be occupied by the students giving reports, there are 6 possible slots they could occupy over those 3 days.
 - Because George cannot give a report on either Monday or Wednesday, he must give his report on Tuesday.
 - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, if George and Robert both give reports, they must be in different spots, occupying one morning time slot each. 
 - If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the day following Nina's report, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
 - If Nina gives a report on Monday, Helen and Irving would both need to give reports on Tuesday, but George has already been scheduled for Tuesday, which is not allowed. Thus, Nina cannot give a report on Monday. 
 - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, Helen and Irving would both need to give reports on Wednesday, in accordance with the condition specified in the prompt. In this scenario either George or Robert can give a report on Monday and the other student can give a report on Wednesday in the morning.
 - It is not possible for Nina to give a report on Wednesday, because if she did, Helen and Irving would have to give their reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, which is not compliant with the prompt restrictions. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Six students give reports over three days, with two in the morning and two in the afternoon on each of the three days.
  Tuesday is the only day George can give his report.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives her report, then Helen and Irving must give reports the following day, unless Nina speaks on Wednesday.
  George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
  
  A: This could not be true, because the possible days for Helen to give a report would be Monday and Tuesday and they are both already taken by Nina and George, so Helen can not give a report on Wednesday.
  
  B: If Nina gives her report on Monday, then George must give his report on Tuesday. Assuming Robert speaks on Wednesday, on Tuesday only Helen and Irving are left to give a report, which does not break the conditions given. Thus, this could be true.
  
  C: If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then George must give his report on Monday and Robert must give his report on Wednesday. This would mean that Helen and Irving would need to give their reports on Wednesday, which would then break the report condition given for Nina's talk. Thus, this could not be true.
  
  D: Olivia is not available to give an afternoon report, so this could not be true.
  
  E: If Robert spoke on Wednesday, then George must speak on Tuesday and Nina must speak on Monday. This would leave Helen and Irving to speak both in the afternoon the following day, which would break the Nina speech condition. Thus, this could not be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- George gives a report only on Tuesday.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- There are a total of 6 oral presentations, with 2 presentations each on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
- George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.

Analysis:
- Since George must give a report on Tuesday, the first presentation on Tuesday must be George's.
- Then, by the given condition, neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon presentation. Therefore, either George or Nina must give their presentation in the afternoon of Tuesday.
- If Nina gives a presentation on Tuesday afternoon, then Helen and Irving must give presentations on Wednesday. This is not possible since Robert has to give his presentation on Wednesday, and both Helen and Irving already gave their presentation on a previous day. Therefore, Nina cannot give her presentation on Tuesday afternoon. Therefore, Nina must give her presentation on Monday, which means that Helen and Irving must give their presentations on Tuesday. Also, George would be left with Wednesday to give his presentation, and Robert can give his on Monday or Tuesday.
Answer: Answer("B") Nina gives a report on Monday.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - George can only give his report on Tuesday.
  - Olivia and Robert cannot give their reports in the afternoon.
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - Exactly 2 reports will be given each day.
Action: 
  Since George, Nina, and Robert all give reports and they do so on different days from one another:
  - George must give his report on Tuesday.
  - If Nina gives a report, it cannot be on Tuesday as George is already giving his report then. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. But if Helen is giving a report on Tuesday, she cannot give a report on Wednesday. Thus, Nina's report must be given on Wednesday. 
  - Robert cannot give his report on Monday since both reports must be given in the morning. Thus, Robert's report must be given on Wednesday.
  From this, we know the following:
  - Nina gave her report on Wednesday.
  - Robert gave his report on Wednesday.
  - George gave his report on Tuesday.
  - Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday.
  Therefore, the only choice that could be true is A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three workers will be selected for the project.
  Exactly one of these three workers will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
 
Solving the problem:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then there are five workers to choose from (as two workers are excluded). Thus, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then there are five workers to choose from, but we cannot allow Smith to be a project member, so only three workers to select from. Thus, the selection is completely determined with Wells as the project leader and Smith and Verma as the other two project members.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are five workers to select from, but we cannot guarantee a project leader (since Quinn or Ruiz should be the project leader). Thus, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we must have Quinn as the project leader and Smith and Taylor as the other two project members. Thus, the selection is completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then one way to select the team is to have Quinn as the project leader, Wells as the second member, and Taylor as the third member. Thus, the selection is not completely determined.
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project team will consist of three workers and one leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a member, they have to be the leader too.
  If Smith is a member, Taylor must also be one.
  If Wells is selected then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  
A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected: This does not determine the team completely since we don't know if the other constraints will be met.

B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected: This does not determine the team completely since we don't know if the other constraints will be met.

C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected: This does not determine the team completely since we don't know if the other constraints will be met.

D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected: This determines the team completely; The third member will be the one from {Smith, Taylor, Verma, Xue} and the leader will be the remaining member from {Quinn, Ruiz}.

E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected: This does not determine the team completely since we don't know if the other constraints will be met.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The special project must have a team of 3 workers and one of them as a leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be project members if leading the project.
  Smith is a project member if Taylor is also.
  Wells is conflicting with Ruiz and Verma to be a project member.
  
Analysis: 
  In order to make a selection, we can either apply each constraint sequentially, or we can eliminate choices that lead to a contradiction. 
  Choices C and D need Ruiz and Wells to be selected respectively, which is not possible due to the conflicts that they create with other team members. Choice A and B have not enough information to determine a complete selection. 
  Lastly, for choice E, if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we can select Wells since they don't conflict with Wells. Then we add Smith as a project member and Taylor must be included. Since Quinn or Ruiz must be the leader, Quinn or Ruiz must be the third member of the team. Therefore, the selection is completely determined. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- 3 workers will be selected for a special project and one of them will be the project leader
- If Quinn or Ruiz are project members, then the worker leading the project must be Quinn or Ruiz
- If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
- If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members of the project.

Action:
Let's go through each option:
A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, it doesn't indicate anything about the rest of the workers, and there are still different possibilities for who can be selected and lead the project. So A cannot be the answer.
B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then this leaves only 5 workers left, and this would leave only 2 workers on the list of possible leaders. It wouldn't be possible to determine one of those workers as the leader, but there are still different possibilities for who can be in the project, so B cannot be the answer.
C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, this still leaves 5 workers, and there are different ways for the project team and leader to be chosen, so C cannot be the answer.
D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then both Verma and Quinn can be included, but one of them will also have to be the project leader, so the project team and leader can be chose concisely, the answer is D.
E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, Wells can still be selected but no one else can be a project member who can replace Wells as the leader, since neither of them can be a project member. This leaves only 3 workers left and there is only one leader possible, so the answer is E.

Therefore, the answer is either D or E. Since D is the most straightforward answer, the final answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Exactly three workers will be selected for the project and exactly one of them will be the project leader.
- Quinn and Ruiz can be project members only if leading the project.
- If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
- If Wells is a project member, Ruiz and Verma can't be.
- We need to pick three members, but we need to take the leader into consideration as well.

Analysis:
If we can determine the leader of the project, we can also determine the two other project members, because Quinn and Ruiz can only be members if leading the project, and we need to take this into account.

Explanation of each option:
A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, we don't have enough information to determine who will lead the project. This option doesn't provide enough information to completely determine the selection for the project.
B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, we don't have enough information to determine who will lead the project. This option doesn't provide enough information to completely determine the selection for the project.
C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we don't have enough information to determine who will lead the project. This option doesn't provide enough information to completely determine the selection for the project.
D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we can only select Quinn, Smith, and Taylor to project members, and the leader will be either Smith or Taylor.
E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we can only select Quinn, Wells, and Taylor to be project members, and the leader will be either Quinn or Wells.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three workers will be selected, and exactly one of them will be project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, the only possibility left for the leader would be Quinn. If Quinn is the leader, then Ruiz can be on the team, since Quinn can be a member only if leading the project. If Ruiz is on the team, then there is only one spot left, and it has to go to either Smith or Taylor (since they must be together). This also satisfies the constraint regarding Wells, so this selection is completely determined.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
Seven workers are being selected for a special project and a leader also need to be selected.
Exactly three workers will be selected and one must be the project leader.
Quinn or Ruiz can be project member only if leading the project, Smith is selected then Taylor must also be selected and if Wells is selected then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
 
Analysis:
If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected then no one can be the project leader because Quinn or Ruiz were required to be a project leader. Therefore, no selection is completely determined if this condition is true.
If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Taylor cannot be a project member. But as per the given constraints, if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Hence, no selection is completely determined if this condition is true.
If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells. However, if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Thus, no selection is completely determined if this condition is true.
If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Quinn must be the project leader, and the other two project members must be Smith and Taylor. Thus, the selection is completely determined if this condition is true.
If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Wells. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Thus, the selection is completely determined if this condition is true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to eliminate options that do not constrain the selection. If any option constrains the selection to the point where it is completely determined, that must be the correct answer. 

Option A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. This doesn't constrain the selection because Smith can be a member without Quinn. Eliminate.

Option B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected. This does not constrain the selection because Quinn and Taylor could still be members and Quinn could be the leader. Eliminate.

Option C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected. This doesn't constrain the selection because neither Quinn nor Xue have any restrictions. Eliminate.

Option D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected. This doesn't completely determine the selection because it is still possible that one of them could be the leader. Eliminate.

Option E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected. This completely determines the selection because if Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members. Therefore, the project leader would have to be Smith, and the other two members would be Wells and Xue. Answer: E.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of the project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Action: 
  Checking each option:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected does not provide enough information to determine the selection for the project.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected. If neither Quinn nor Taylor are selected, then according to the constraints: if Smith is in, Taylor must also be in which means that Wells and Verma can't be in the project. Therefore, the only possibility is to choose Smith, Xue, and Wells. As Wells is in the project neither Ruiz nor Verma can be on the project. Thus, for a project leader, Quinn or Ruiz must lead the project. Therefore, the project members: Xue, Smith, and Wells. And Quinn or Ruiz leads the project. This option does completely determine the selection for the project.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected does not provide enough information to determine the selection for the project.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected. If neither Ruiz nor Wells are selected, this means that at most one of them can participate, and the other one cannot be a leader since the only eligible workers for being the project leader are Quinn and Ruiz. Thus, either Ruiz or Wells should be excluded from the project, and the other, along with Quinn, should be included in the project. However, this selection does not fulfill all the necessary constraints since if Wells is on the project, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be in the project.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected. If neither Ruiz nor Verma are selected, then according to the constraints, the only possible selection for the project team is to have Smith, Taylor, and Wells. As it is already decided that neither Ruiz nor Verma is on the project, the leader of the project should be Quinn.
  
  Therefore, the only option that completely determines the selection for the project is B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected. Answer("B").
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
- Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
- If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
- If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Action: 
If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, the project leader must be Ruiz, and for that to happen, Ruiz must be a project member and Quinn cannot be. Therefore, Taylor must be a project member, with Smith, and the third project member could be Wells, Verma, or Xue. 
If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, the project leader must be Ruiz, and for that to happen, Ruiz must be a project member and Quinn cannot be. Therefore, Smith must be a project member, with Taylor, and the third project member could be Wells, Verma, or Xue. 
If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells. If the leader is Ruiz, with Xue not on the project, Verma cannot be on the project with Ruiz and either Quinn or Taylor must be on the project to meet the constraint that either Quinn or Ruiz is the leader. If the leader is Wells, which means neither Ruiz nor Verma can be on the project, then Smith and Taylor must be on it and either Quinn or Xue must be on it to meet the requirement for a leader. 
If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the three project members must be Smith, Taylor, and one of the other five workers. 
If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, the project leader must be Wells, so the members must be Smith and Taylor plus Xue, Quinn, or Ruiz. 
Thus, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, so the answer is (E). Answer("E")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The company has 7 sales representatives in total and 3 sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

To be true: 
If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then either both of them work in Zone 2 or both of them work in Zone 3 as there are no other options left according to the given information in the context.

A: Kim works in Zone 2. - This could be true as there is at least one more person in Zone 2. 
B: Mahr works in Zone 1. - This can't be true as it would violate the condition that Stuckey and Mahr are in the same zone.  
C: Parra works in Zone 3. - This could be true as there are more people in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. - This could be true as Stuckey could be in Zone 2 along with Mahr. 
E: Tiao works in Zone 1. - This can't be true as if Stuckey and Mahr are in the same zone that can't be Zone 1 as there are no other options for them to be together.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- We know that Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.

Analysis: 
- Using the given information we can determine that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and it cannot be determined if either of them works in Zone 2 or 3.
- We can determine that it is impossible for Mahr to be in Zone 2, as it has already been determined that either Tiao or Udall work in Zone 2.
- We cannot determine whether Kim is in Zone 2, Zone 1 or Zone 3.
- We cannot determine whether Parra is assigned to Zone 3.
- We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, but we cannot determine whether they are assigned Zone 2 or Zone 3.
- It is possible for Tiao to be in Zone 1, as either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  We have 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  We have 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone:
Kim cannot work in Zone 2, since it would break the condition that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. 
Mahr cannot work in Zone 3, since it would break the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Parra cannot work in Zone 1, since it would break the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
If Stuckey works in Zone 2 (with Udall), it would break the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Therefore, the only choice that could be true is:
Action: Answer("B") Mahr works in Zone 1.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The company has 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - The sales representatives are divided among three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Parra and Tiao cannot both work in the same zone. That means one of them works in Zone 1 and the other works in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  - Tiao and Udall cannot both work in the same zone. That means one of them works in Zone 2 and the other works in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then this means that either Mahr and Udall are in one zone and Stuckey is in another, or Mahr and Stuckey are in one zone and Udall is in another. 
We know that Udall is in the same sales zone as Stuckey, so if Mahr is in a different zone, then Udall is the only representative in that zone. However, we know that there are more reps in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Zone 3 must have at least three representatives (Stuckey, Udall, and one more), which means that Mahr must be in the same zone as Stuckey and Udall.
So, Option D: Stuckey works in Zone 2 could be true.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives that work in a software company's three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, that means Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Since more of the sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there can only be one sales representative in Zone 1. Based on the information given: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, meaning the other must be in a different zone. Since there are seven sales representatives in total, three must be in Zone 3. Therefore:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. [not possible]
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1. [not possible]
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. [possible]
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. [not possible, since we can't have both Mahr and Stuckey in the same zone and there is only one spot left in Zone 3]
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1. [not possible, since Parra works in Zone 3, and either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.]

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: There are three sales zones labeled as Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. There are seven sales representatives named Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall. Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Also, there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

1- Parra or Tiao is in Zone 1.
2- Tiao or Udall is in Zone 2.
3- Parra and Quinn are together. 
4- Stuckey and Udall are together.
5- More of the sales representatives are in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone:
- Then Udall and Stuckey are in the same group, and from 4, they work in the same zone as Parra and Quinn, leaving Tiao and Kim working in Zone 2 and more representatives in Zone 3 than Zone 2 from 5. 

A: Kim works in Zone 2 -> doesn't fit as Tiao and Kim work in Zone 2.
B: Mahr works in Zone 1. -> doesn't fit as either Tiao or Parra would be located in Zone 1.
C: Parra works in Zone 3. -> fits with the explanation given. Therefore, C is the correct answer.
D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. -> doesn't fit as we are told that more representatives are in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
E: Tiao works in Zone 1. -> doesn't fit as we were told that Parra or Tiao is in Zone 1.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Parra or Tiao work in Zone 1.
- Tiao or Udall work in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
- There are more sales reps in Zone 3 compared to Zone 2.

If Mahr and Stuckey are in the same sales zone:
- Udall is in their sales zone.
- Parra, Quinn, Tiao, and Kim cannot be in this sales zone as they all have restrictions with either Mahr, Stuckey, or Udall.
- Hence, Parra, Quinn, Tiao, and Kim must be in the other two sales zones.

Option A: Kim works in Zone 2
- Kim must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 3 based on the above condition, hence cannot be in Zone 2. 
- Eliminate A.

Option B: Mahr works in Zone 1
- Parra/Tiao, Quinn, Udall, and Stuckey must be in Zone 3 since it has more sales reps than Zone 2.
- But this configuration violates the condition that either Parra or Tiao work in Zone 1.
- Eliminate B.

Option C: Parra works in Zone 3
- Tiao cannot work in Zone 2, hence Tiao must be in Zone 1.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, which is Zone 3.
- Udall and Stuckey also must be in Zone 3 because of the condition that there are more sales reps in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Kim works in Zone 2 following the above deductions.
- This configuration satisfies all the given conditions.
- Hence, C could be true.

Option D: Stuckey works in Zone 2
- Tiao cannot work in Zone 2, hence Tiao must be in Zone 1.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, which is Zone 3.
- Udall and Stuckey also must be in Zone 3 because of the condition that there are more sales reps in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Kim works in Zone 2 following the above deductions.
- This configuration satisfies all the given conditions except for the fact that Stuckey is in Zone 2.
- Eliminate D.

Option E: Tiao works in Zone 1
- Parra/Tiao, Quinn, Udall, and Stuckey must be in Zone 3 since it has more sales reps than Zone 2.
- But this configuration violates the condition that either Tiao or Udall work in Zone 2.
- Eliminate E.

Therefore, the answer is C. Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall) working in 3 sales zones (Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3).
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then that sales zone cannot be either Zone 1 or Zone 2. Thus, either Parra or Tiao must work in the sales zone with Mahr and Stuckey, leaving the other with Zone 1. We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. This means that Zone 3 has at least three sales representatives (Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall), so it is the zone with the most sales representatives. Thus, Choice (D) is the only option that could be true based on our logical deductions.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The company has 7 sales representatives.
  There are 3 sales zones, and every representative works in one of them.
  Either Parra or Tiao, but not both, works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall, but not both, works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, they can both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. 
  If they work in Zone 3, then choice C cannot be true since Parra must work in Zone 1 or there will be no one to work there.
  If they work in Zone 2, then Stuckey and Udall are in Zone 2 together. There will be no one in Zone 1. Parra and Quinn must, therefore, be in Zone 3. Only Tiao is left for Zone 1.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The software company employs seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then we know that Udall cannot work in that zone. Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 2, and since Tiao cannot work in that zone, Tiao must work in Zone 1. This also means that Parra cannot work in Zone 1 and must work in Zone 3. We already know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, so Quinn must also work in Zone 3. So, we have Mahr and Stuckey in one zone, Udall and Tiao in another zone, and Parra and Quinn in a third zone. Which one of the following could be true? 
    A: Kim works in Zone 2. Not possible. We already know that Udall works in Zone 2.
    B: Mahr works in Zone 1. Not possible. We already know that Tiao works in Zone 1 and Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone.
    C: Parra works in Zone 3. True. We already know that Parra works in Zone 3.
    D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. Not possible. We already know that Udall works in Zone 2 and Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone.
    E: Tiao works in Zone 1. True. We already know that Tiao works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the answer is either Choice C or Choice E.

  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Elimination:
  A: The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, therefore this order is not possible.
  B: This order satisfies all constraints, hence it could be a possible order of businesses in spaces 1 through 7.
  C: The pharmacy and one of the restaurants cannot occupy spaces 4 and 5, they should be in spaces 1 and 7. Therefore, this order is not possible.
  D: The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, therefore this order is not possible.
  E: The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, therefore this order is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. 
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Elimination:
  We can eliminate options A and C because they do not have a restaurant at one end and pharmacy at the other end.
  We can eliminate option D because the two restaurants cannot be adjacents.
  We can eliminate option E because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
A: The pharmacy is at one end of the row and the restaurant is at the other; the pharmacy is next to the optometrist, but there is no veterinarian before the toy store. Therefore, A is incorrect.
B: The pharmacy is at one end of the row and the restaurant is at the other; the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, but there is no space with three empty spaces to separate the restaurants and two other businesses. Therefore, B is also incorrect.
C: Both restaurants have two spaces between them. The pharmacy is at one end of the row and the restaurant is at the other; the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, but there is no space next to the veterinarian for the toy store to fit in. Therefore, C is incorrect.
D: The pharmacy is at one end and one of the restaurants is at the other; the pharmacy is next to the optometrist; there are two spaces between the restaurants and two other businesses, and the toy store is not next to the veterinarian. This order satisfies all the constraints and is, therefore, the correct order.
E: Although both restaurants have two spaces between them and the pharmacy is next to the optometrist, the pharmacy is not at one end of the row and one of the restaurants is not at the other. Therefore, E is also incorrect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
   * The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
   * The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
   * The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
   * The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Solution:
I will go through each option and check if it satisfies all the constraints.

A: The pharmacy and restaurant are at either end, the toy store is located next to the veterinarian which contradicts one of the constraints. 
B: The pharmacy and restaurant are at either end, the pharmacy is located next to the veterinarian or optometrist which satisfies one of the constraints and the separation between the two restaurants is at least two other businesses, this option satisfies all the constraints. 
C: There are no specific businesses at either end, the pharmacies could be located at positions 3 or 5 which contradicts the first constraint. 
D: There are no specific businesses at either end, one of the restaurants is located next to the toy store which contradicts the fourth constraint. 
E: The first restaurant is at the beginning and the second restaurant is at the end which satisfies one of the constraints, however, the toy store is located next to the optometrist which contradicts the fourth constraint.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Using these constraints, we can eliminate options A, C, and D because they violate at least one of them. 

Option B:
- Pharmacy is at one end of the row
- The restaurant is at the other end of the row
- The two restaurants are separated by three other businesses (optometrist, shoe store, and veterinarian)
- The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian
- The toy store is not next to the veterinarian

Option E:
- The restaurant is at one end of the row
- The other restaurant is third from the end
- The pharmacy is next to the optometrist
- The toy store is not next to the veterinarian

Both option B and E meet all the constraints. 
Action: Answer("B or E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacy must be at either end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or space 7.
  One of the restaurants must be at the opposite end of the pharmacy, so it can only be in space 1 or space 7.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant that is not at the end must be in at least space 3.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is in space 1, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2, and if the pharmacy is in space 7, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 2 if the toy store is in space 1, and the veterinarian cannot be in space 6 if the toy store is in space 7.
  Therefore, the only possible options for the spaces where the veterinarian can be are 3 and 5.

Option A violates the constraint that one of the restaurants must be at the opposite end of the pharmacy. 
Option B satisfies all of the constraints. 
Option C does not satisfy the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. 
Option D does not satisfy the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
Option E does not satisfy the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - There are seven businesses, each occupying exactly one space. 

Let's go through each option:
Option A: Starts and ends with the required businesses but it violates the pharmacy being next to optometrist or veterinarian. Incorrect.

Option B: Starts with the required business, ends with a restaurant, the two restaurants have at least two businesses separating them, and the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, which satisfies all constraints. It also correctly places the toy store. This could be a valid option.
 
Option C: Starts with a restaurant and ends with a restaurant, which violates the constraint of the pharmacy being at one end, and one of the restaurants at the other end. Incorrect.

Option D: Starts with a restaurant, ends with the pharmacy, but it fails to properly separate the two restaurants and places the toy store next to the veterinarian, which violates the constraint. Incorrect.

Option E: Starts and ends with a restaurant, violates the constraint of the pharmacy being at one end, and one of the restaurants occupying the other end of the row. It also incorrectly places the toy store. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Eliminating the choices:
  A: Given the pharmacy must be at one end and restaurant at the other, this option starts with pharmacy and ends with a restaurant but the toy store is next to the veterinarian which is not allowed. Eliminated.
  B: Given the pharmacy must be at one end and restaurant at the other, this option starts with pharmacy and ends with a restaurant, and the toy store is not next to the veterinarian. Additionally, the optometrist is next to the pharmacy. This could be a valid sequence. 
  C: The pharmacy must be at one of the ends of the row, hence the sequence with pharmacy at the third position is not possible. Eliminated
  D: The requirement of two businesses separating the 2 restaurants makes this sequence invalid, since there are 3 restaurants together. Eliminated
  E: The requirement of two businesses separating the 2 restaurants makes this sequence invalid, since there are 2 restaurants together. Eliminated

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - X is  mentioned in chapter 1.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, U would be mentioned in chapter 2 if X is mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, T would be mentioned in chapter 3 or later if X is mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T would be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, and W would be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7 if X is mentioned in chapter 1.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, if Z is mentioned in chapter 3, S would be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, but they cannot be adjacent.
  - If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and there is no way to separate the T and W mentions by two chapters.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then chapter 6 must be the chapter where the adjacent U and X clues are mentioned. If chapter 7 has Z, then chapter 4 has T, chapter 3 has R, and chapter 2 has S.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The seven clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z are each mentioned once, in chapters 1 to 7 in some order.
T is not in the first chapter and must be two chapters apart from W.
S and Z cannot be in consecutive chapters.
W and X cannot be in consecutive chapters.


*X*  _  _  _  _  _  _  _ 

If X is in chapter 1, then U has to be in chapter 2. Then, by the constraint involving W, neither T nor W can be in chapter 3, which means R must be in chapter 3. Then, by the constraint involving S and Z, neither S nor Z can be in chapter 2 or 4. This leaves the following options: 

U is in chapter 2, and R is in chapter 3. 
W is in chapter 5, which leaves T to be in chapter 4 and Z to be in chapter 6.

Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W could only be mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The mystery novel has seven chapters and seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, Z.
  - Each of the clues is mentioned exactly once in a chapter.
  - The clues must be mentioned according to the following constraints:
    - T cannot be in chapter 1.
    - T must be before W, with exactly two chapters separating them.
    - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  - X is mentioned in chapter 1.
  
  A: If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be in chapter 2. But T cannot be in chapter 1, so A cannot be true.
  B: If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be in chapter 6 and W must be in chapter 4. This satisfies the constraints, so B could be true.
  C: If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 3. But S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters, so C cannot be true.
  D: If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be in chapter 3 and R must be in chapter 1, but X must also be in chapter 4 or 6. This violates the constraints, so D cannot be true.
  E: If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be in chapter 2. But X is in chapter 1 and U must be in an adjacent chapter to X, so E cannot be true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The mystery novel consists of seven chapters with seven clues - R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  T cannot be mentioned in Chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

The only option that is possible if X is mentioned in chapter 1 is that U and Z are mentioned in Chapters 2 and 3. 
If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, U must be mentioned in Chapter 2. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in Chapter 2 or 3. 
Z cannot be mentioned in Chapter 2 since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, Z must be mentioned in Chapter 3, and S must be mentioned in Chapter 4. 
Since T cannot be mentioned in Chapter 1, and W must be mentioned two chapters after T, T must be mentioned in either Chapters 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in either Chapters 5 or 6. 

The only option that is possible with these constraints is:
U in Chapter 2, X in Chapter 1, Z in Chapter 3, T in Chapter 2 or 3, W in Chapter 5 or 6, S in Chapter 4, and R in Chapter 7.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The clues need the following order: T _(not in ch1)_ -> W _(2 chapters apart from T)_ -> S & Z _(not adjacent to each other)_ -> X & U _(adjacent to each other)_ -> R. 
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U should be in chapter 2, since they must be adjacent to each other. That means neither W nor S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2. Also, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  A: If X is in chapter 1, U should be in chapter 2, which means neither T nor W can be in chapter 3.
  B: Correct. Since X is in chapter 1, U is in chapter 2. Then, S and Z cannot be in chapter 3. Because T cannot be in chapter 1, it should be in chapter 4, and W should be in chapter 6. So the remaining clues are R and S, Z which can be in chapter 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, R can be in chapter 7.
  C: If X is in chapter 1, U should be in chapter 2, which means S and Z cannot be in chapter 3.
  D: If W is in chapter 5, then T must be in chapter 4 (because it is 2 chapters apart from W). Then, U and X must be in chapters 2 and 3. That means neither T nor W can be in chapter 6. So, W can't be mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: If Z is in chapter 3, then T should be in chapter 4, W should be in chapter 6, and S should be in chapter 5. Then, U and X should be in chapters 1 and 2. That means T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  X is mentioned in chapter 1.
  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis:
  Since X is mentioned in chapter 1, U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  From the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. 
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  
  Now, we consider the possibilities for R, S, T, and Z:
  Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in either chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  So, S and Z must be mentioned in either chapter 5, 6, or 7, but not all in the same chapter.
  
  Option A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. 
    If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then the only possible place for W is chapter 6, but then X would have to be in chapter 7, which violates the rule that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then the only possible place for W is chapter 5, and then X must be in chapter 7. R would then have to be mentioned in chapter 6 and S and Z would have to be in chapters 4 and 5, but it's not clear which one goes in which chapter. Therefore, this is a possible arrangement.
    
  Option B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
    If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then the only possible place for W is chapter 6, which means that X would have to be in chapter 5, but then U and X would not be in adjacent chapters, so this cannot be true.
    If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then the only possible place for W is chapter 5, but this creates a problem because U and X must be in adjacent chapters, so this cannot be true.
  
  Option C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. 
    This would mean that Z is mentioned in either chapter 5, 6, or 7, but Z cannot be in any of these chapters because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  Option D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. 
    This is a possible arrangement because it satisfies all the constraints. T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and then X must be in chapter 7. R and S can be in any of the remaining chapters, and Z can be in chapter 6.

  Option E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
    This contradicts the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: Answer("D") 
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The clues - R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z – are to be mentioned exactly once in chapters 1 through 7 in a certain order. 
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. 
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. 
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. 
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Given that X is mentioned in chapter 1, the order of mention of other clues can be determined based on the given constraints. 
Since W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, it cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4. Hence, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later. 
Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, U must be mentioned in chapter 2, and no later than in chapter 3. 
Also, by the given constraint, chapter 4 must not mention T, U, or W. Hence, T must appear in chapter 3 at the latest.

A: R is mentioned in chapter 3. - Not possible since R must be mentioned before U, which is already mentioned in chapter 2.
B: R is mentioned in chapter 7. - Not possible since R must be mentioned before U, which is already mentioned in an early chapter. 
C: S is mentioned in chapter 2. - Not possible since S cannot be adjacent to Z, which is not possible before chapter 4 due to the mention of T and U. 
D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. - Possible order: X (1), U (2), S (3), T (4), R (6), W (5), Z (7).
E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3. - Not possible as Z must be mentioned after T and U, which are mentioned in chapter 3 and 2 respectively.

Action: Answer("D") 
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven chapters in the mystery novel, and clues R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z are mentioned once each in non-adjacent chapters.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and must be mentioned before W, with two chapters between their mentions.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, but U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Action: 
  - If X is mentioned in chapter 1, clues W, U, and T cannot be present in chapter 2.
  - As U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters and W cannot be adjacent to X, U and X are in chapters 1 and 2 in some order in both cases.
    - X is mentioned in chapter 1, so U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  - After U, X must be mentioned, so X and U go in chapters 1 and 2 in some order in both cases. 
    - With U in chapter 2, X must be in chapter 1, not chapter 2.
  - Therefore, chapter 3 must contain clues T and W with one clue between them, and it must be either R or Z. 
    - If R is in chapter 3, S will have to be in chapter 4 and Z in chapter 7. That leaves only chapter 5 for W and chapter 6 for T, which means that S and W would have to be adjacent and is not allowed. Therefore, R cannot be in chapter 3.
    - So, Z must be in chapter 3. This leaves R for chapter 7, S for chapter 2, and W for chapter 5. And T must be in chapter 6.
    - So, the only option among the given choices is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5. 
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven chapters in the mystery novel.
  - There are seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z— that need to be mentioned exactly once, one in each chapter.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1, must be before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  
Order with X in chapter 1: 
  Chapter 1: X
  Chapter 2: U or S or T or W or Z
  Chapter 3: U or S or T or W or Z
  Chapter 4: W or T or S or Z or U
  Chapter 5: W or T or S or Z or U
  Chapter 6: T or Z or S or U or R
  Chapter 7: T or Z or S or U or R
  
Checking options: 
  A: R in chapter 3 violates the U and X must be in adjacent chapters statement.
  B: R in chapter 7 is possible, but we cannot have T and Z together, so this option is not valid.
  C: S in chapter 2, two options suitable for Chapter 2: U, Z, T. If U is in chapter 2, then X must be in Chapter 3. If Z is in chapter 2 then X must be in Chapter 1, Therefore S cannot be in chapter 2, so this option is not valid. 
  D: W in chapter 5 is possible, two options suitable for chapter 2: T or Z. If T is in chapter 2, X must be in Chapter 4, which violates the statement that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, Z must be in Chapter 2, and T must be in Chapter 4. and W must be in Chapter 5, which leaves R and S for Chapters 3 and 7. Therefore, this option is valid.
  E: Z being in chapter 3, two possibilities suitable for chapter 2: T or S. If T is in Chapter 2, W is in Chapter 5, X must be in Chapter 4 since X is adjacent to U. Then U is either in Chapter 1 or Chapter 6, in both cases, Z and S will be adjacent to each other, which violates the statement that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be in Chapter 2, and T must be in Chapter 4, U in chapter 6. This arrangement leaves R and Z for chapters 3 and 7, respectively, which are also non-adjacent chapters. Therefore, this option is also valid.

Actions: 
  The arrangements that satisfy given constraints if X is mentioned in chapter 1 are D and E. Since there are two valid answers, I'll choose the first alphabetical answer. 
  Answer("D")

  The clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints:
    - T cannot be in chapter 1.
    - T must be before W, with two chapters separating them.
    - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
    - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be in chapter 2.

Analysis:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be in chapter 2. This means that W cannot be in chapter 3. It also means that T must be in either chapter 4 or 5, and W must be in either chapter 6 or 7 with two chapters separating them from T. Furthermore, S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.

Solutions:
  A: R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 since T is not in chapter 1 and U is in chapter 2.
  B: R can be mentioned in chapter 7, if W is in chapter 6 and there are two chapters in between T and W.
  C: S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because of the constraint on S and Z in adjacent chapters.
  D: W cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 because T must be between W and X with two chapters in between them; and T cannot be in chapter 1.
  E: Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 because of the constraint on S and Z in adjacent chapters.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The newspaper has three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Each section has exactly 2 photographs, and 6 photographs total.
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section that is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - Gagnon's photographs cannot appear in the Sports section.
  
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, we know that Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, so we are left with two possibilities: both Gagnon photos could be in the Lifestyle section, or both Gagnon photos could be in the Metro section.

If both of Gagnon's photos are in the Lifestyle section, and one of those photos is with Hue (because there must be at least one Hue photo in the Lifestyle section), then that means Fuentes must also have a photo in the Lifestyle section to satisfy the condition that the number of Hue photos in Lifestyle equals the number of Fuentes photos in Sports. That leaves only one Fuentes photo, which must be in the Sports section, so this scenario eliminates choices C, D, and E.

That leaves us with a possible scenario that fits the conditions of the problem, that is, both of Gagnon's photos are in the Metro section. If that is the case, then there are no Gagnon photos in the Lifestyle section, so it is possible that both photos in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. This scenario does not violate any of the conditions of the problem, so it is a possible answer.

Answer: A. Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  * The sections are Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  * There are 6 different photographs.
  * Two photographs are in each section.
  * There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  * For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  * At least 1 photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least 1 photograph in the Metro section.
  * The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes's photographs in the Sports section.
  * None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("B")  
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon has no photograph in the Sports section. That means:
* Fuentes and Hue must have at least one photograph each in the Sports section.
* Hue must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
Since each photographer can have at most 3 photographs in total, there are two cases to consider:
1. Gagnon has 2 photographs each in the Lifestyle and Metro sections. This means there is no space left in the Sports section for Gagnon to have any photographs, and in this case, both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue (A is false), both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes (C is false), and neither Gagnon nor Hue have any photographs in the Sports section (D and E are false).
2. Gagnon has 1 photograph in Lifestyle and 1 photograph in Metro. This means Fuentes and Hue must both have 2 photographs in the Sports section to satisfy the conditions. In this case, it's possible that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, and the other is by Hue (B is true), and that one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, and the other is by Hue (D is true). It's not possible for both photographs in the Sports section to be by Hue because in that case there will be more than 3 photographs by Hue in total (E is false). Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- A total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who also has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then the only section where Gagnon's photographs cannot appear is the Sports section. Therefore, the photographs in the Sports section are either both by Fuentes and Hue or one by Fuentes and one by Hue.

A: It is possible for both photographs in the Lifestyle section to be by Hue, but there is no information that relates to Gagnon.
B: This is possible. One photograph in Lifestyle section could be by Fuentes and the other one by Hue.
C: It is not possible because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who also has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
D: It is not possible because no photograph can be by Gagnon in the Sports section. 
E: It is not possible because we already know that one of the photographs in the Sports section is not by Gagnon.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If a section has both photographs taken by Gagnon, then the other two photographers must fill photographs in that section as well as in other sections.
  A: There cannot be two photographs in the Lifestyle section by the same photographer, so this is not possible.
  B: This is possible, since the Lifestyle section can have one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue as long as Hue has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  C: Each section can have at most two photographs, so this is not possible.
  D: This is possible, since the Metro section can have one photograph by Gagnon and one by Hue. This satisfies the condition that there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  E: If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then Fuentes must have two photographs in the Lifestyle section and one in the Sports section. This violates the condition that the numbers of Hue's and Fuentes' photographs in the Lifestyle and Sports sections must be the same.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon and Hue.
  - Total 6 different photographs to appear, exactly 2 photographs per section for three sections (Lifestyle, Metro and Sports).
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then no photograph by Gagnon can appear in the Sports section. Further, none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Lifestyle section paired with the two photographs by Hue required to satisfy the condition for those photographers. As a result, any possible scenario would require at least one Fuentes photograph in the Sports section and at least one Hue photograph in the Lifestyle section. In option A, both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, which satisfies the constraint that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Any number of photographs by Fuentes could appear in the Sports section. Option A is possible.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 photographs in total - 2 in each section taken by 3 photographers - Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each photographer can have between 1 and 3 photographs appear.
  At least one photographer who appears in the Lifestyle section also appears in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Gagnon photographs cannot appear in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then it means that none of Gagnon's photographs can appear in the other two sections, and so the other two photographs must be taken by Fuentes and Hue. 

If we assume that the two photographs in the Lifestyle section are not both taken by Gagnon, then we know that at least one photographer who appears in the Lifestyle section also appears in the Metro section. This can only be Fuentes or Hue. Additionally, we know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, if Hue appears in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must appear in the Sports section, and so both of these situations are dependent. 

Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, it means that if one of the Lifestyle photographs is by Hue, then one of the Metro photographs must also be by Hue. Similarly, if one of the Lifestyle photographs is by Fuentes, then one of the Metro photographs must also be by Fuentes. 

Therefore, the only option that could be true is that both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. This would mean that neither of the Metro photographs can be taken by Hue, and so they must be taken by Fuentes and Gagnon. Finally, since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, then the two Sports photographs must be taken by Fuentes and Hue.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, Sports.
  - Two photographs per section, six photographs in total.
  - Each photographer must have at least one photograph, but no more than three photographs.
  - Lifestyle and Metro sections must share one photographer.
  - The number of photos in Lifestyle taken by Hue must be equal to number of photos in Sports taken by Fuentes.
  - Both photos in the Sports section cannot be taken by Gagnon.
  
A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue -> Not possible, for one, the Lifestyle section must share one photographer with Metro section, therefore at least one of the photos must be taken by a different photographer.
B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue -> Not possible, there must be a photographer that appears in both, Lifestyle and Metro sections, otherwise the condition cannot be fulfilled.
C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes -> Not possible, there must be at least one photographer that appears in both, Lifestyle and Metro sections, and since no photographer can take more than 3 photographs, then it is impossible that one photographer takes both pictures in the Metro section.
D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, and one is by Hue -> Not possible, Gagnon cannot have photographs in the Sport section, and has to contribute to at least one of the sections.
E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue -> Possible, if Gagnon takes a picture in Lifestyle section, Fuentes takes two in the sport section, Hue takes two in the Lifestyle section and one in Metro section. All conditions are satisfied.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  Each section has exactly two photographs.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then there can be no Gagnon photographs in the Sports section.
Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, that means that the photographs in the Lifestyle and Metro sections must have a photographer other than Gagnon who also has photographs in the Metro section. 
Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro, and one of the photographs in Metro must not be taken by Gagnon.
The only option that fulfills this condition and can be true is E: both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. This also satisfies the condition that The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - 6 photos were taken by 3 photographers (Fuentes, Gagnon, Hue).
  - There are 3 sections (Lifestyle, Metro, Sports) and two photographs are selected from for each section, totaling to 6 photographs.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: If both photographs in one of the sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photos in the Sports section. Therefore, Gagnon's photographs can only be in either the Lifestyle section or the Metro section. However, if Gagnon's photographs are both in the same section, that would mean that section would have three photographs by the same photographer, which would violate the first condition mentioned. Hence, Gagnon must have one photo in the Lifestyle section and one photo in the Metro section. Therefore, the Sports section cannot have any of Gagnon's photographs, which means that Fuentes and Hue must have a photo each. Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, it follows that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - 2 photographs in each section, so 6 photographs total.
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three of his photos.
  - Fuentes photos in Sports section match with Hue photos in Lifestyle.
  - Gagnon photos cannot be in the Sports section.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
If both photographs in one of the sections are by Gagnon, then neither of the photographs in the Sports section can be by Gagnon. This limits the choices for the Sports section to either Fuentes or Hue. But we know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the other photograph in the section with Gagnon photos must be by either Fuentes or Hue. Since we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and that Gagnon cannot have photos in the Sports section, the only possible option satisfying all conditions is that one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. Therefore, the answer is D.

The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Six antiques are auctioned for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  2. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  3. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  4. The harmonica cannot be auctioned on a later date than the lamp.
  5. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  6. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  7. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  * According to condition 3, the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  * According to condition 6, the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  * According to condition 7, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  * Considering all these points, we can conclude: 
         * The sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd (the earliest date) or June 3rd if it is not auctioned on June 2nd.
         * If the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd, it is possible that the table is auctioned on June 2nd.
         * If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
         * The harmonica must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, in order to satisfy all the given conditions.
         * The lamp and the mirror can be auctioned on June 5th and June 6th, but we do not know which is auctioned when.
         * The vase can be auctioned on June 6th, but we do not know which one of the other items is auctioned when.

Action: Answer("D")  The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd is a possible scenario according to the given conditions.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase.
  
Answering the question requires checking all answer choices against the given conditions to see if any of them could be true:
A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial, which is supposed to be auctioned before the mirror, could only be auctioned on June 1st. However, we know that the sundial is not going to be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then we know that the mirror is also going to be auctioned before June 2nd. However, we don't know when the harmonica, table, vase, and sundial are going to be auctioned. Therefore, B could be true.
C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then we know that the sundial and mirror must be auctioned earlier than June 2nd. However, we don't know if the table, harmonica, or lamp are going to be auctioned before June 2nd. Therefore, C could be true.
D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then we know that the mirror is going to be auctioned on June 2nd (since the harmonica cannot be auctioned before it), and the vase is going to be auctioned on June 1st (since it has to be before the mirror and sundial). Therefore, D cannot be true.
E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp could be auctioned on June 6th. However, the vase has to be auctioned on June 1st for this to be a possibility, which violates the given conditions. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase.
  Table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  On each day, exactly one antique is auctioned.

Analysis:
  We need to determine which of the given options conflict with the conditions given in the context.

  Option A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
    This could be true because the mirror could be auctioned earlier than the lamp, which is not necessarily on June 2nd.
  Option B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
    This conflicts with the condition that the mirror would then have to be auctioned earlier than the lamp.
  Option C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
    This conflicts with the condition that the sundial is auctioned earlier than the vase.
  Option D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
    This could be true because the harmonica, table, vase and sundial would have been auctioned before the lamp.
  Option E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
    This could be true because the harmonica, table, vase, sundial, and lamp would have been auctioned before the mirror.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are six antiques to be auctioned: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  The auction runs for six consecutive days from June 1st to June 6th.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
  We know the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st so the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  From the second rule, we know that if harmonica comes before the lamp, the mirror comes before the lamp too. Therefore, if the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then harmony must be auctioned on either June 1st or June 2nd, respectively. However, from the third rule, the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror, so the sundial must be held on June 2nd. That means the mirror must be auctioned on a later date than the harmonica. Therefore, A is false.
  From the third rule, we know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. So, one of the following is true:
    i. The table is auctioned before the harmonica. That means the table is auctioned on June 1st, May 31st (not part of the question), or May 30th (not part of the question). If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica can come only on June 2nd (to fulfill the condition of the table), so we would have: May 30 (not part of the question): vase, May 31 (not part of the question): lamp, June 1: table, June 2: harmonica, June 3: mirror, June 4: sundial, June 5: lamp. But this violates the rule about the sundial, so this option is ruled out.
    ii. The table is auctioned before the vase. That means the table is auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or on June 6th. If it's auctioned on June 2nd, then we know the sundial is auctioned on June 1st, the mirror is auctioned on June 3rd, the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th (because it must be auctioned after the table), the vase is auctioned on June 5th (because it must come after the table), and the lamp is auctioned on June 6th. Therefore, C is possible. If the table is auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, we can establish the sequence of the other antiques as follows:
       * If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror and the vase must be on June 1st and June 2nd, but it's unclear which antique should be on which date, so no answer choice matches this scenario.
       * If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then harmony must be auctioned on June 5th in order to fill condition two, but that means the tables have to be on June 3rd. So we would have: June 1: mirror, June 2: vase, June 3: table, June 4: sundial, June 5: harmonica, June 6: lamp. Therefore, D is possible.
  We can rule out options E, because if the mirror is on June 5th, then the harmonica would have to be on June 6th according to the second rule. But then the lamp would have to be auctioned on June 4th to satisfy the rule that the table is sold before their lamp or vase. However, this would mean that the sundial and vase would be on the same day, which is not possible based on the third rule.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror, and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  The harmonica and the lamp have a specific relationship with the mirror's auction date.
  
Analysis:
  We know that the sundial can not be auctioned on June 1st and that it is sold before the mirror and vase. So, the sundial must be auctioned on either June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Considering the third condition about the table, the table must be auctioned on either June 1st or June 2nd.
  From the second condition, if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Since the table is being auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, the only possibility is that the table is auctioned on June 1st, and the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, and the harmonica is auctioned after June 2nd. Then, the final order would be June 1st - table; June 2nd - vase, and June 3rd - harmonica.
  From the second condition, we can see that the lamp cannot be on June 2nd. So, we can eliminate choices B and C.
  The mirror can be on June 2nd based on the scenario described above, so we cannot eliminate A.
  Also, based on the same scenario, the lamp can be auctioned on June 3rd, and if so, the mirror can be auctioned on June 5th as well. Therefore, E can be true.
  
Action: Answer("A or E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- There are six antiques to be auctioned from June 1st to June 6th: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp.
- The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase.
- The table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

Analysis: 
- The sundial is not auctioned on the first day, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
- The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, so it must be auctioned on June 1st or before. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st because the table would be auctioned before it. As a result, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd at the earliest.
- According to the second rule, if the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp, the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp. Since the sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror, the only possible order for the first three days is June 1st: Table, June 2nd: Sundial, June 3rd: Harmonica, Mirror, or June 1st: Table, June 2nd: Sundial, June 3rd: Mirror, Harmonica.
- If the vase is auctioned on June 4th or later, then it would be auctioned after the mirror, which cannot happen because the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. 
- The only remaining antiques to be auctioned after June 3rd are the lamp and the vase. According to the last rule, the table is auctioned before the lamp, so the latest date for the lamp to be auctioned is June 5th. As a result, the only possible options are:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd - This cannot be true because the mirror must be auctioned before or on June 3rd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd - This cannot be true because the latest date for the lamp to be auctioned is June 5th.
  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd - This can be true if the auction order is: June 1st: Table, June 2nd: Sundial, June 3rd: Mirror, Harmonica, June 4th: Vase, June 5th: Lamp, June 6th: Empty
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd - This cannot be true because the earliest date for the lamp to be auctioned is June 4th.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th - This cannot be true because the latest date for the mirror to be auctioned is June 3rd.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
- The following can be inferred from the given information:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
- There are six antiques and six dates, so each antique is auctioned on exactly one of the six days.

Analysis:
- Choice A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror would have to be auctioned the same day, which is not possible due to the fact that the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
- Choice B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp must be auctioned on either June 2nd or June 3rd. If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
- Choice C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd. This is possible according to the given conditions, so this choice could be true.
- Choice D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th. In either case, the vase would have to be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
- Choice E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd, the sundial on June 3rd, and the harmonica on June 4th. This would mean that the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th and the mirror on June 6th. Therefore, this choice could be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- There are six consecutive days of auction from June 1st to June 6th.
- The items to be auctioned are: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
- The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
- If harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
- The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and vase.
- The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd at the earliest, violating the condition that the harmonica must be auctioned after or on the same day as the table. Therefore, A is not possible.
B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must also be auctioned on that day, which means that the table must also be auctioned on that same day, violating the condition that the table cannot be auctioned on the same day as the harmonica. Therefore, B is not possible.
C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and lamp cannot be auctioned before June 3rd. The table must be auctioned before the vase, which means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, but the sundial cannot be auctioned on that day, according to the statement. The remaining item, the mirror, must therefore be auctioned on June 1st. Hence, C is possible.
D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must also be auctioned on June 3rd at the earliest, which means that the table must be auctioned before June 3rd. Since the table cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, it must be auctioned on June 1st, along with the mirror. Then, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later. Therefore, D is not possible.
E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and lamp must also be auctioned on June 5th or later, violating the condition that the harmonica must be auctioned before or on the same day as the table. Therefore, E is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The harmonica is auctioned later than the lamp if the mirror is auctioned later than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned earlier than both the mirror and vase.
  Either the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the table is auctioned before the vase.
  
  A: It would violate that the sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then according to the second constraint the harmonica should be auctioned on June 1st, but according to the fifth constraint the table should be auctioned before the harmonica, so that means the table, the harmonica, or the sundial would have to be auctioned on June 1st.
  C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then according to the third constraint the sundial and mirror must also be auctioned on June 2nd, which would mean the vase would be auctioned before the harmonica, but that would violate the fifth constraint.
  D: The only way for the lamp to be auctioned on June 3rd is if the table is auctioned before then, which would also mean the vase would have to be auctioned before then. If we assume the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the only option for June 2nd is either the vase or the harmonica since the table and sundial cannot be auctioned again, but either option would violate the third or fifth constraint respectively. Therefore, it is not possible for the lamp to be auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then according to the second constraint the lamp and harmonica must have been auctioned before that, which means the table and sundial would have to be auctioned before the lamp and harmonica. With the sundial already auctioned and the table not able to be auctioned on June 5th, that means either the harmonica or the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st, which would violate the second constraint.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

Analysis:
 - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Thus, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd to June 6th.
 - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Thus, if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd to June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
 - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Thus, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 1st.
 - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Thus, if the table is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, then the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd to June 6th, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd to June 6th. If the table is auctioned on June 3rd to June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the vase must be auctioned on a date after the harmonica.

Answer:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. - Possible, according to the analysis above.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. - Not possible, because if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, but this violates the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd. - Not possible, because the vase must be auctioned on a date after the harmonica, and the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the lamp must also be auctioned, which violates the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. - Possible, according to the analysis above.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. - Not possible, because if the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, which violates the condition that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The trades must be of three kinds: 
  - trading one building for one other building of the same class.
  - trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  - trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are all either class 1 or class 3. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  B: This statement is possible. RealProp trades Yates House (class 3) to Trustcorp for Meyer Building (class 2), and Southco trades Meyer Building (class 2) and Flores Tower (class 1) to RealProp for Garza Tower (class 1).
  C: The Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp do not include the Yates House. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  E: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  The trades must be one for one building, one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  A: RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp, and only one building owned by Southco, so this cannot be true.
  B: Southco owns both a class 1 and a class 2 building, so it cannot own the Meyer Building (class 2) and the Garza Tower (class 1) but not the Lynch Building (class 2). This cannot be true.
  C: Southco cannot own three class 2 buildings and Trustcorp cannot own any of the buildings owned by Southco, so this cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp cannot own the Yates House (class 3) and the Flores Tower (class 1), so this cannot be true.
  E: Trustcorp cannot own the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Flores Tower (class 1), so this cannot be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns 3 buildings (Garza Tower, Yates House, and Zimmer House)
  Southco owns 2 buildings (Flores Tower and Lynch Building)
  Trustcorp owns 3 buildings (King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building)
  Each building is categorized as either Class 1, 2, or 3, and the classifications of the buildings owned by each company are specified.
  Trades must be of one of three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one Class 1 building for two Class 2 buildings
    - Trading one Class 2 building for two Class 3 buildings
    
A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This is false, because RealProp only owns three buildings, none of which are the Lynch, Meyer, or Ortiz buildings.
B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. This is false, because Southco only owns the Flores Tower and Lynch Building, they do not own the Garza Tower or the Meyer Building.
C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This is false, because Southco only owns the Flores Tower and Lynch Building, they do not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building.
D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. This is false. Trustcorp does not own the Yates House - Realprop owns the Yates House.
E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. This could be possible as TrustCorp can trade one Class 2 building (either King Building, Meyer Building, or Ortiz Building) for the Yates House (which is a Class 3 building), and then trade the Yates House for the Garza Tower (which is a Class 1 building). Therefore, it is not impossible to have TrustCorp own the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building after the trades.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The building owned by RealProp are the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  The building owned by Southco are the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
    
A: The buildings owned by RealProp are not the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
B: The Meyers Building belongs to Trustcorp, not Southco. This trade is illegal.
C: Southco does not own the King Building. This trade is impossible.
D: The Yates House belongs to RealProp, not Trustcorp.
E: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp, and the Lynch Building is owned by Southco, not Trustcorp.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The trades available are limited to specific types between specific class categories, and the properties owned by each company are defined.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Therefore this cannot be true, and is the answer.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp. Therefore this can be true.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building (class 2), the Meyer Building (class 2), and the Ortiz Building (class 2). Therefore this can be true.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the King Building (class 2), the Meyer Building (class 2), and the Ortiz Building (class 2). Yates House is owned by RealProp. Therefore this can be true.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the King Building (class 2), the Meyer Building (class 2), and the Ortiz Building (class 2). Flores Tower is owned by Southco. Therefore this can be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns one class 1, and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns one class 1 and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  The possible trades are: 1-1, 1-2, 2-3
  A: RealProp's buildings are all either class 1 or class 3, so it's impossible for RealProp's buildings to include the Meyer Building, which is class 2 and owned by Trustcorp. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower, which is class 1, and the Meyer Building, which is class 2. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: King Building and Ortiz Building are class 2, and Meyer Building is class 2, so it's impossible for Southco to own all three of them. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp owns neither the Yates House nor the Flores Tower. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  E: Trustcorp owns the King Building, which is class 2, and the Lynch Building, which is class 2. Therefore, E could be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The trades must follow one of the given three conditions.
  
A: The buildings owned by RealProp can only be class 1 or class 3 which cannot be the same as the buildings owned by Trustcorp. Hence, this option is not possible.
B: Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building. Therefore they cannot own the Meyer Building, which is a class 2 building, at the same time. Hence, this option is not possible.
C: Southco can only own at most two buildings. Hence, they cannot own three buildings at the same time. Hence, this option is not possible.
D: This is possible, as Trustcorp can own the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Yates House (class 3) if they trade the Meyer Building (class 2) with RealProp's Yates House (class 3).
E: This is not possible as Trustcorp and RealProp cannot own the same building at the same time.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:

  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
    
A cannot be true because RealProp does not own the Lynch Building or the Meyer Building.
B cannot be true because Southco does not own the Meyer Building.
C cannot be true because Southco does not own and cannot trade the King Building.
D cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.
E can be true because Trustcorp owns the Lynch Building and Southco owns Garza Tower.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp: Garza Tower (1), Yates House (3), Zimmer House (3).
  Southco: Flores Tower (1), Lynch Building (2).
  Trustcorp: King Building (2), Meyer Building (2), Ortiz Building (2).
  Trades must be of the following types:
    1) Replace a building with another of the same class
    2) Replace a class 1 building with 2 class 2 buildings
    3) Replace a class 2 building with 2 class 3 buildings.
    
A: The buildings owned by RealProp are class 1 and class 3 only. 
B: Southco owns only class 1 and class 2 buildings.
C: Southco owns only class 1 and class 2 buildings. 
D: Trustcorp cannot own both the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Yates House (class 3) because there is no option to trade a class 1 building for a class 3 building. 
E: Trustcorp cannot own both the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2) because there is no option to trade a class 2 building for a class 1 building.

Action: Answer("A")

  Only 3 types of trade are possible:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

Analysis:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are class 1 or 3. This statement implies that Trustcorp owns all the buildings owned by RealProp, which is not possible. So, this cannot be true. 
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are class 1 and 2. The Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp. So, this statement implies that Southco owns buildings owned by both RealProp and Trustcorp, which cannot be true. So, this cannot be true.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are class 2. The King Building and the Ortiz Building are owned by Trustcorp. So, this statement implies that Southco owns a building owned by Trustcorp, which is not possible. So, this cannot be true.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are class 1 and 3. So, this cannot be true.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are class 1 and 2. The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp. So this statement implies that Trustcorp owns a building owned by RealProp, which is not possible. So, this cannot be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The manager must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies, and if Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Analysis: 
  According to the given constraints: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, and not all photographers have to be assigned. This means that there would be an incomplete assignment to at least one of the ceremonies. 
  
  Starting with the given options:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  - This is not a valid option because there are only four photographers assigned, and the requirement is to have assigned at least two photographers for each ceremony.
  
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  - This is not a valid option because there are only three photographers assigned, and the requirement is to have assigned at least two photographers for each ceremony.
  
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  - This is not a valid option because there are only two photographers assigned to one ceremony, and the requirement is to have assigned at least two photographers for each ceremony.
  
  D: Heideck, Lai
  - This is not a valid option because it does not satisfy the condition "Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies."
  
  E: Knutson, Mays
  - This is a possible option. If Knutson is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony (fulfilling the condition "If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it."). According to the condition "If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony", Lai and Gonzalez are not required to be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Therefore, the complete assignment could be Knutson and Mays to Silva University and Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck to Thorne University.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies--one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University.
  There are 6 photographers available-- Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, Mays-- but not all have to be assigned.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  We need to find a possible complete list of photographers that could be assigned to the Silva University ceremony while following the rules.

Solution:
  We can eliminate option A because Knutson is not assigned to Silva University ceremony and it violates the rule that was mentioned before: "If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it."
  Option B violates the constraint: "If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies," so it is eliminated.
  Option C does not meet the minimum requirement of two photographers, so it is not valid.
  Option D violates the constraint: "Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies."
  Option E is valid since Gonzalez does not have to be assigned, and Knutson and Mays are assigned to another ceremony, also note that Lai is not in the ceremony. Therefore, Answer("E").
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  Lai and Mays cannot be assigned to the same ceremony.
  At least 2 photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.
  There are exactly 6 photographers available.
  
Solving the problem requires trying out different configurations, but we need to start by satisfying the constraints we can before attempting to solve the problem.
Heideck must be assigned to the Silva ceremony since he must be assigned to a ceremony with Frost. This means Knutson cannot be assigned to the Silva ceremony since both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony if Knutson isn't assigned to Thorne. Also, Gonzalez and Lai cannot both be assigned to Silva, meaning that Gonzalez should be assigned to Thorne so that Lai can be assigned to Silva.
Therefore, one possible configuration is Frost and Heideck assigned to Silva, with Gonzalez and Lai assigned to Thorne - Option B
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The manager must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  - Exactly six photographers are available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  - No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  - If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Answer: Choice A (Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson) is not possible because Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, and according to the given constraints, if Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Choice B (Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck) satisfies all the given constraints and is a valid assignment. Choices C, D, and E do not satisfy the requirement that at least two photographers must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.

Knowledge:
  - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  - Exactly six photographers are available but not all have to be assigned.
  - No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  
Elimination:
  - Option C cannot be the complete assignment for the Silva University ceremony because it only has 2 photographers and neither Frost nor Lai are included.
  - Option D cannot be the complete assignment for the Silva University ceremony because it only has 2 photographers and neither Frost nor Gonzalez are included.
  - Option E cannot be the complete assignment for the Silva University ceremony because it only has 2 photographers and Gonzalez, Heideck, Mays are not included. 
  - Option A cannot be the complete assignment for the Silva University ceremony because it has 4 photographers assigned to it and Knutson is included.
  - This leaves only one choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The manager needs to assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Analysis:
  * The total number of photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony should be at least two.
  * Based on the constraint, Frost and Heideck should be assigned to the same ceremony.
  * If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  * If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Solution:
  The possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony:
  Frost, Heideck and Knutson. (This satisfies the constraints)
  
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson -> Frost and Heideck can't be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck -> It only has 3 photographers assigned to one ceremony, but it should be at least two photographers assigned to each ceremony.
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson -> It only has two photographers assigned, but it should be at least two photographers assigned to each ceremony.
  D: Heideck, Lai -> It only has two photographers assigned to one ceremony, but it should be at least two photographers assigned to each ceremony. Also, Knutson and Frost are not assigned yet.
  E: Knutson, Mays -> It only has two photographers assigned to one ceremony, but it should be at least two photographers assigned to each ceremony. Also, Frost and Heideck are not assigned yet.

Action: Answer("A") -> none of the given options satisfies the constraints, but among the given choices, this is the closest one.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  - Exactly six photographers (Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays) are available, but not all have to be assigned.
  - No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
  - Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  - If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.

Solution:
  - Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony. Therefore, Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai, and Mays must be assigned to the other ceremony.
  - If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to Silva University if Lai is not assigned to Thorne University.
  - If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  - Mays cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony because Frost and Heideck are already assigned to one ceremony, and Lai and Mays must be assigned to different ceremonies.
  - Therefore, the only option that could be a complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The manager of a photography business needs to assign 2 photographers to each of 2 graduation ceremonies.
  Six photographers are available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  Frost must be assigned with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
  We need to assign photographers for the Silva University ceremony. 
  We have 3 photographers left - Gonzalez, Knutson and Lai.
  
  A: Frost and Heideck are already assigned together in one ceremony. Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, but this option does not fully satisfy the two photographers assignment requirement of Silva University.
  B: Frost and Heideck are already assigned together in one ceremony. Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University. This leaves Lai and Mays unassigned, which satisfies the constraint that Lai and Mays cannot be assigned to the same ceremony. This option fully satisfies the two photographer assignment requirement of Silva University.
  C: Frost and Heideck are not assigned to Silva University ceremony. This option does not fully satisfy the two photographers assignment requirement of Silva University.
  D: Frost and Knutson are not assigned to Silva University. This option does not fully satisfy the two photographers assignment requirement of Silva University.
  E: Mays is not assigned to Silva University ceremony. This option does not fully satisfy the two photographers assignment requirement of Silva University.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, so they cannot be assigned to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
A: If Frost and Heideck are assigned to Silva, they need at least one more photographer to meet the requirement, but Knutson cannot be assigned to Silva, so A is not possible.
B: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, so they both have to be assigned to the same ceremony. Gonzalez satisfies the constraint that Lai must be assigned to Thorne, so he can be assigned to Silva. Thus, B is possible.
C: This choice assigns only Gonzalez and Knutson to Silva, but we need at least two photographers, so C is not possible.
D: The constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together is violated because neither is assigned to Silva, so D is not possible.
E: Knutson violates the constraint, so E is not possible.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The manager needs to assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Six photographers are available for the task: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  Frost must be assigned with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, they must be to different ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  
Analysis:
  To form an assignment that can be valid, at least two photographers should be assigned to Silva University.
  According to the constraints, Frost must be assigned with Heideck to one of the ceremonies; Heideck must be assigned to Silva or Thorne if Knutson is not assigned to Thorne; Lai must be assigned to Thorne if Gonzalez is assigned to Silva. 
  From the options above, only option A assigns three photographers to Silva University, which includes Frost and Heideck. Thus, it is possible for this selection to be a valid assignment.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited fourth.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.

Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, the order is:
  1-_____-2-Tao-3-_____4-Peters-5-_____6-_____7-_____
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order becomes:
  1-_____-2-Tao-3-_____4-Peters-5-_____-6-_____7-_____
  Villas was recruited immediately before White:
  1-_____-2-Tao-3-_____4-Peters-5-_____6-Villas-7-White
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so either Quinn or Rovero must be next to Tao:
  1-_____-2-Tao-3-Quinn/Rovero-4-Peters-5-_____6-Villas-7-White

Action: Answer("A")  
According to the above analysis, if Tao was recruited second, Quinn could have been recruited third.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  
Analysis:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so he cannot be second.
  - Tao was recruited second, so he cannot be third.
  - Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth, the possible order of Peters, Quinn, and Rovero is either 2-1-3 or 3-1-2.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so it is possible that she was fifth and White was sixth.
  - Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, and Peters was fourth, then Stanton was either recruited first, fifth, sixth, or seventh.

Action: Answer("D") 
  Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, Quinn cannot be recruited third. If Villas was fifth, then White would be sixth, so the only possible option among the remaining choices is that Villas was sixth and White was seventh. Therefore, D is the correct answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time: Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  Stanton was not immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  
Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment was: _ Tao _
  The only possible positions for Stanton are either the third or the fifth. 
  White and Villas should be in positions 6 and 7, but it is unclear which one of them should be recruited first.
  Still, Quinn must be recruited before Rovero.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: If Tao was recruited second, the possible orders of recruitment are as follows:
  1. Peters, Tao, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, and Stanton (Stanton is recruited fifth.)
  2. Peters, Tao, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, and Stanton (Stanton is recruited third.)
  
Therefore, Quinn could have been recruited third (choice A).
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Tao was recruited second.
  - Peters was recruited fourth.
  - The suspect recruited all accomplices one at a time.
  - Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  
Process of elimination:
  - Peters (recruited fourth) and Tao (recruited second) have one person in between them. Therefore, Peters cannot immediately follow Tao or immediately precede Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited before Rovero. Therefore, Quinn can be recruited first, second, or third at the earliest, and Rovero can be recruited fourth, fifth, or sixth at the earliest.
  
Analysis of choices:
  A: If Tao was recruited second and Quinn was recruited third, then the earliest Rovero could be recruited is fourth, which is inconsistent with the given statement that Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, A is not true.
  B: If Tao was recruited second, Peters was recruited fourth, and Quinn was recruited before Rovero, then it is possible that Rovero was recruited fifth. Therefore, B could be true.
  C: If Tao was recruited second and Stanton was recruited sixth, then White, who was recruited immediately after Villas, would have to be fifth. This is inconsistent with the given statement that Peters was recruited fourth, which eliminates C as a possibility.
  D: If Tao was recruited second and Villas was recruited sixth, then White would have to be seventh. Since there are only seven accomplices, this eliminates D as a possibility.
  E: If Tao was recruited second and White was recruited third, then Peters would have to be first. This is inconsistent with the given statement that Peters was recruited fourth, which eliminates E as a possibility.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The seven accomplices were recruited one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.

Analysis: 
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited third and Villas must have been recruited seventh, as per the given information. This means Rovero must have been recruited sixth and White must have been recruited fourth. Therefore, Quinn and Stanton must have been recruited first and fifth, but it is not clear which was recruited first.

Action: Answer("A") 
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. Peters was recruited fourth.
  2. There are seven accomplices in total.
  3. Tao was recruited second.
  4. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  5. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  6. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.

Process of elimination:
- Since Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited fourth, then three people were recruited between Tao and Peters.
- Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth, Quinn must have been recruited first or second.
- If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero would have to be recruited fifth or sixth, which can't be since there are only three people left. Therefore, Quinn was recruited second.
- Since Villas was recruited immediately before White and Peters was recruited fourth, then either Villas or White must be recruited seven. However, if White was recruited last, then Stanton would have to be recruited sixth, but Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Villas was recruited seventh.
- Since Tao was recruited second and Villas was recruited seventh, then Stanton must be recruited either third, fourth, or fifth.
- If White was recruited third, then there would be no option left for Stanton since he cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, E is not a possible answer.
- If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Stanton would have to be recruited sixth, but this contradicts the fact that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, B is not a possible answer.
- If Stanton was recruited sixth, then there would be no option left for Rovero since he cannot be recruited immediately before or after Stanton. Therefore, C is not a possible answer.
- If Villas was recruited sixth, then it would mean that White was recruited fifth, which would be a contradiction since Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, D is not a possible answer.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  1) The suspect recruited seven accomplices one at a time.
  2) Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  3) Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  4) Villas was recruited immediately before White
  5) Peters was recruited fourth.

If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the accomplices is Tao, ?, ?, Peters, ?, Villas, White, in which the blank spaces will be filled with the remaining accomplices. 
As Quinn was recruited before Rovero, Rovero cannot be immediately after Tao so therefore Rovero cannot be fifth. After Tao and before Peters, the only possibility is Stanton. Villas was right before White, so White must be either last or immediately before Villas. E is not therefore a possible answer as White cannot be third, otherwise Villas would be seventh, which is not possible. 
Option A is not possible as Peters was recruited fourth, and thus Quinn cannot be third.
The only options that remain are Stanton and White as fifth and sixth. If Stanton was fifth, then everything else falls into place, Peters fourth, Villas sixth, and White seventh. This means that D, "Villas was recruited sixth", is also true. If White was fifth, then Stanton would be sixth and Villas seventh, this would make D impossible and therefore the correct option is A: Quinn was recruited third. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Seven accomplices are recruited one at a time, and Peters was recruited fourth.
- Stanton wasn't recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
- Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White.

Solution:
- If Tao was recruited second, then neither Stanton nor Rovero were recruited before Tao.
- That means Stanton should have been recruited at either position 3 or 7.
- But Peters was recruited fourth, so Stanton couldn't be recruited at position 3, 
  hence Stanton should be recruited at position 7.
- That means both White and Villas should be recruited at positions 5 and 6, 
  respectively, in any order.
- Because Quinn was recruited before Rovero, the only possible order is Peters Quin Tao Rovero Villas White Stanton.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Tao was recruited second.
- Peters was recruited fourth.
- Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White. 
- Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. 

Reasoning: If Tao was recruited second, we know that Peters was recruited fourth so that means at least three people were recruited between Tao and Peters. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been 1st, 2nd, or 3rd and Rovero must have been 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th. Villas was recruited immediately before White, so if Tao is second, Villas must be first or third and White must be fifth or seventh. Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, Stanton must be either third, fourth, fifth, or sixth. 

Action: Answer("D") 
Choice D: Villas was recruited sixth is possible since we know Tao was 2nd, Villas was recruited immediately before White, and Peters was 4th. It also satisfies the condition that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
Response 9:
Knowledge: The suspect recruited the accomplices one by one. 
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White. 
  Peters was recruited fourth.

If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitments could be Peters - Tao - Villas - White - Quinn - Rovero - Stanton OR Peters - Tao - Villas - White - Rovero - Quinn - Stanton. 

A: If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn must be recruited after Rovero. Therefore, Quinn cannot be recruited third. 
B: If Tao was recruited second, then Rovero could be recruited fifth. 
C: If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton cannot be recruited sixth because Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. 
D: If Tao was recruited second, then Villas could not be recruited sixth because Villas was immediately before White. 
E: If Tao was recruited second, then White must be recruited after Quinn. Therefore, White cannot be recruited third.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The maintenance company sets service targets for response times for three clients (Image, Solide, Truvest).
  - Two service targets are set for each client, one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - The targets are set according to three conditions, listed in the context.
  
Condition 1: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
Condition 2: Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
Condition 3: Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Given that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, we can determine that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target (by Condition 3). 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which means that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. 
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis: 
  Based on the given condition that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, we know that Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days. We also know that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day if Truvest's website target is 2 days, and Solide's website target must be 2 days if Truvest's website target is 1 day. Since we do not have enough information about Image's targets, we cannot determine the exact values for Image's targets, but we do know that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Truvest has two targets: one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
  - Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  - Six targets must satisfy the following constraints:
    - None of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("E")  
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is not greater than 2. By the last constraint, Solide must have a website target shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day, which means that Image's voicemail target must also be 1 day. By the second constraint, Image's website target must be shorter than Solide's, which means that Image's website target must be 1 day and Solide's website target must be 2 days. Therefore, Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days. Thus, Solide's website target is 1 day, which is the answer (E).
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Truvest has two service targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - The service target for Truvest's website is shorter than that for its voicemail.
  - Image, Solide, and Truvest each have two service targets, one for website and one for voicemail.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("D")  
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then that means Truvest's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days. Because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days, then there are only two possible website targets for Solide: 1 day or 2 days. However, if Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's voicemail target would have to be 3 days (since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target). This contradicts the given information that Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day, which implies that Truvest's voicemail target is 1 day. Hence, either Image's voicemail target is 2 days or Image's voicemail target is 1 day. However, we know that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, which means Image's voicemail target must be 1 day and Truvest's website target must be 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days, which is answer D.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Truvest has a website target and voicemail target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Since we know that Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, we can deduce that Truvest's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days which means Solide's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Also, since None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, we know that Truvest's voicemail target must be shorter than or equal to its website target.

Option A is not guaranteed because we only know that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets and we don't know what Truvest's voicemail target is.

Option B is not guaranteed because we don't have any information about Image's website target.

Option C is not correct for the same reason as option B.

Option D is not guaranteed because we don't know whether Solide's website target is 1 day or 2 days, we only know that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Option E is guaranteed because if Truvest's website target is 2 days, Solide's website target must be 1 day according to the given conditions.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: In the service targets for the three clients, there are two targets for each client—one for website requests and one for voicemail requests. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target must be greater than or equal to its website target.

Analysis:
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's voicemail target must be greater than or equal to its website target. This tells us that either Truvest's website and voicemail targets are both 1 day or both 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target cannot be 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day. Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Solide's voicemail target must be 1 day as well. Finally, because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Solide's voicemail target is 1 day, Image's voicemail target must be less than 1 day which is not possible according to the given service targets. Therefore, we can conclude that there must be an error in setting the targets as it cannot satisfy all the given conditions.

Action: Answer ("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
- Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- The six targets are set according to the following conditions:
  1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, this means that Truvest's voicemail target must be longer than its website target.

Analyzing the options:
- None of the options relate directly to Truvest's targets, so we need to consider the conditions to infer the correct answer.
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target.
- Because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, we can infer that Solide's website target is also shorter than Truvest's voicemail target. This means that Solide's website target is set at 3 days or 2 days, because the shortest voicemail target is 1 day.
- Because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, we know that Image's voicemail target is 1 day. Therefore, Image's website target must be 1 day or 2 days, because the longest voicemail target is 3 days.
- We don't have enough information to determine whether Image's website target is 1 day or 2 days, so options A, B, and C are not necessarily true.
- According to the conditions, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This means that if Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must be set at 1 day. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - The company sets two targets for each client to set the average service response times, one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: 
  - If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then we know that Truvest's website target is 1 day or 2 days (because its voicemail target is less than or equal to its website target).
  - If Solide's website target is longer than Truvest's website target, then we know that Solide's website target must be 2 days.
  - Therefore, Solide's voicemail target must also be 2 days or less (because its website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target).
  - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so we know it is less than or equal to 2 days.
  - Since Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target, we know that Truvest's website target is 3 days or 2 days.
  - If Truvest's website target is 3 days, then its voicemail target would also have to be 3 days or longer, which would violate the condition that its website target is shorter than its voicemail target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days.
  - If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then its voicemail target would be either 2 days or less. But we already know Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so it must be 1 day. This also means that Image's website target cannot be longer than 1 day, so Image's website target is also 1 day.
  - Therefore, the correct answer is B: Image's website target is 2 days. (This choice is incorrect but cannot be "None of the Above", so we select the most likely answer).
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions: 
  1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then we can deduce that their website target <= voicemail target.

If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is set to 1 day or 2 days (not 3 days). 
If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website must be 1 day (because of condition 3). And if Solide's website target is 1 day, then Image's website target must be 1 day (because of condition 1). However, this would violate condition 2 that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, hence not possible. 

Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 1 day.

Now, we know that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. The only possible value for Solide's website target is 1 day (since the website target cannot be longer than the voicemail target, which we don't know yet). Therefore, Truvest's website target is 2 days.

Knowing Truvest's website target, we can conclude that Image's voicemail target is 3 days (because of condition 2).

Thus, we have: 
- Truvest's website target = 2 days
- Truvest's voicemail target = 3 days
- Solide's website target = 1 day
- Solide's voicemail target = 2 days
- Image's website target <= 2 days
- Image's voicemail target = 3 days

The only option consistent with this information is:
Action: Answer("B") Image's website target is 2 days.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Truvest has both a website target and a voicemail target.
- Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
- Image has both a website target and a voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide has both a website target and a voicemail target.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Analysis:
- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, we do not have information to determine which of Truvest's targets is the longest or which is the shortest.
- Since we know that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and we do not have enough information to determine the length of Truvest's voicemail target, we cannot determine which of Image's targets is 2 days.
- Similarly, since we do not know the length of Truvest's website target, we cannot determine which of Image's website and voicemail targets is shorter.
- However, we do know that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, if Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must also be shorter than its voicemail target.
- If Solide's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then it can only be 1 day, since the website target cannot be longer than the voicemail target.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The articles are categorized into three types: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Working through the options:
  - If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y and therefore cannot be fourth. So we can rule out choices C, D, and E.
  - If J is second, then G must be first, but then we cannot place R without breaking the rule that R cannot be next to G. So we can rule out choice A.
Action: Answer("B")  
The only remaining option is B: J is third. In this case, the order of articles can be:
    H, Q, J, S, Y, G, R.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  We have 7 articles, labeled G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y, and three topics: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y. 
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  The question says that Y is fourth.
  
  By the first condition, S cannot be immediately after Q, because they are from the same topic. If Q is fourth, then S cannot be earlier than Q either, since Y has to be after S. So Q must be in third.
  By the third condition, S must be earlier than Y, which means Y is last.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. If J is first, then G is second, and R is third. Meanwhile, Q has to be fourth in this case which violates the first condition. If J is second, then G must be first and R must be one of fifth/sixth/seventh, but since Q has to be third in this case, we violate the second condition. If J is third, then G must be second and R must be first. Q has to be fourth, H fifth and S sixth. This satisfies all conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The articles can be ordered as follows:
1  2  3  4  5  6  7
F  N  F  ?  N  N  W

The letters represent the articles as follows:
G, H, and J: finance
Q, R, and S: nutrition
Y: wildlife

J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R --> JGR (in this order)

Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, N cannot follow N and F cannot follow F.

If Y is fourth then Q is third and S is second. So the order for the articles is:
F N S Y Q N W

The only option that satisfies the order is (B): J is third
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  We need to find the position of each article and infer which statements are true according to the given conditions.
  The second article cannot be from finance because J must be earlier than G.
  S must be earlier than Y, so Y has to be fifth or seventh.
  Q has to be at least third to be earlier than S.
  If Q is third, then R has to be sixth and G has to be fourth.
  If Q is fourth, then G has to be third and R could be sixth or seventh.
  A, B, C, and E are not determined by the given conditions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Three articles are about finance: G, H, and J.
  2. Three articles are about nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  3. One article is about wildlife: Y.
  4. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  5. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  6. S must be earlier than Y.
  7. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Y is the fourth article, so neither Q nor S can be fourth. Therefore, Q and S must be second and third, in some order. This means that G and R are sixth and seventh in some order (they must be consecutive, and S, Q, and Y have already been placed). This leaves J, H, and G to be placed first, fourth, and fifth, in some order. Because G must be earlier than R, and R is either sixth or seventh, J must be first and G must be fourth. Therefore, the correct answer is B: J is third. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  * The article order is subject to several conditions, including prohibitions about consecutive articles on the same topic and requirements for the ordering of S, Q, Y, J, G, and R.
  * If Y is fourth, then we know that G and J must be first and second (in some order) since they can't be later than Y.
  * Additionally, we know that Q must be third because S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third.
  * Therefore, the order of the first four articles is either GJQS or JGQS.
Choices:
  A: If J is second, the order is GJ... and there is no place for QS. This choice contradicts the fact that therefore Q must be third. Incorrect.
  B: If J is third, the order is GQSJ. This choice is consistent with the orderings we've worked out, so it could be correct.
  C: If Q is first, the order is Q... and there is no place for G or J. Incorrect.
  D: If Q is third, the order is ..QSJ. This choice is consistent with the orderings we've worked out, so it could be correct.
  E: If R is seventh, the order is ..[some combination of GJQS]...R. This choice is consistent with the information we've been given, but it doesn't provide any information about what comes before R. Therefore, it doesn't have to be true even though it could be. Incorrect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The editor has to edit the articles in the following order: G, H, J, Q, R, S, Y. 
  G, H, and J are about finance; Q, R, and S are about nutrition; Y covers wildlife. 
  If two articles are consecutive, then they must not be about the same topic.
  S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third. 
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth in the order, then the order of the first three articles must be one of G-H-J, H-J-G, or J-G-H. 

Analysis: 
  - A cannot be true because J cannot be second if G comes later than J, which is the case here as Y comes after the first three articles. 
  - B can be true because if J is third, then G has to be second, and both of these articles have to come before Q. 
  - C cannot be true because Q cannot be first if S is not third. 
  - D cannot be true because if Q is third, S has to be earlier than Q in the order, which contradicts the condition that S must be earlier than Y. 
  - E cannot be true because R is about nutrition, and the article about wildlife (Y) has to come last, therefore Q, R, and S cannot be the last three articles in the order.

Action: Answer("B") the statement "J is third" must be true.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Seven editorial articles are given, covering three topics.
  2. G, H, and J cover finance.
  3. Q, R, and S cover nutrition.
  4. Y covers wildlife.
  5. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, thus cannot be edited in succession.
  6. If S is before Q, then Q can only be third.
  7. S must be before Y.
  8. J is before G, while G is before R.
  
Solution:
- Since Y is fourth, only the following orderings are possible for the articles:
        Q, R, S, Y, _, _, J or G or H.
        R, Q, S, Y, _, _, J or G or H.
        S, Q, R, Y, _, _, J or G or H.
- Given S is before Y, the only possible ordering for which S is before Q is (S, Q, R, Y, G, H, J). 
- G must be before R, so the correct ordering is (S, Q, R, Y, G, H, J).
- Thus, Q must be third and R must be fifth.
- Therefore, J can either be second or sixth, but H can only be seventh.
Action: Answer("D") Q is third.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  Three of the articles (G, H, and J) cover finance.
  Three other articles (Q, R, and S) cover nutrition.
  The remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  If Y is fourth, then Q must be third.
  The order, which satisfies the given conditions, is as follows:
  S, G, Q, Y, H, R, J
  
  A: J cannot be second because J must be earlier than G.
  B: J must be later than Q. Therefore, J cannot be third either.
  C: Q cannot be first because S always comes before Q.
  D: This is true. If Y is fourth, then Q must be third.
  E: R cannot be seventh because J must be earlier than G and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, R must be either fifth or sixth.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - 3 articles cover finance: G, H, and J.
  - 3 articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  - 1 article covers wildlife: Y.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Approach: 
  - If Y is fourth, then we can infer some things based on the different rules governing the order of the articles.
  - The only article that can be edited before Y would be S, since it cannot be Q. Therefore, the order of the first four articles must be S_ Y_ _ _
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R => J cannot be fourth.
  - Therefore, the possibilities are that J is first, J is second, or Q is first and J is third.

Action: Answer("A") => J must be second if Y is fourth.

  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  We need to determine which option cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.
  
  Option A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
    - The western must be shown before the horror film.
    - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
    - Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, one of them must be shown on screen 1.
    - This option satisfies all the given conditions.
  
  Option B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
    - The western must be shown before the horror film.
    - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
    - Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, one of them must be shown on screen 1.
    - This option satisfies all the given conditions.
  
  Option C: the western, the horror film
    - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
    - Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, one of them must be shown on screen 1.
    - The western must be shown before the horror film.
    - This option satisfies all the given conditions.
  
  Option D: the western, the mystery
    - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
    - Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, one of them must be shown on screen 1.
    - The western must be shown before the horror film.
    - This option satisfies all the given conditions.
  
  Option E: the western, the sci-fi film
    - The western must be shown before the horror film.
    - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
    - Since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, one of them must be shown on screen 1.
    - The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1.
    - However, we have two movies remaining: the horror film and the mystery, and only one screen available for the 9 P.M. movie. This means that one of them must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 3, but the given conditions prohibit either of these movies from being shown on screen 3.
  
Conclusion:
  Option E: the western, the sci-fi film CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer("E")'.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 5 movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  2 screens (1&2) show movies at 7 pm and 9 pm.
  Screen 3 shows one movie at 8 pm.
  If the western is shown before the horror movie, romance, and the sci-fi film, the guesswork of the order of the movie schedule can be eliminated.
  The (mystery and horror movies) and (romance and screen 2) will not be together.
  The sci-fi movie is not shown on screen 3.
  
Analysis:
  In one list of Screen 1, there will be a 7 pm and 9 pm movies, The Western movie should be one of the movies at 7 pm and the horror movie is shown after that on either screen 1 or 2.
  Choice A cannot be accurate if the horror movie is shown on screen 2 with the mystery at 7 pm.
  Choice B can be true because the sci-fi movie can be shown on screen 1 or 2 with the mystery at 7 pm and the horror movie on the second screen at 9 pm.
  Choice C can be true because the western movie can be shown on screen 1 at 7 PM and the horror movie on screen 2 at 9 PM.
  Choice D can be true because the western movie can be shown on screen 1 at 7 PM and the mystery movie on screen 2 at 9 PM.
  Choice E can be true because the western movie can be shown on screen 1 at 7 PM and the mystery movie on screen 2 at 9 PM.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each. Screen 3 shows exactly one movie.
  Screen 1 has two showtimes: 7pm and 9pm.
  Screen 2 has two showtimes: 7pm and 9pm.
  Screen 3 has one showtime at 8pm.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis:
  Choices A and E are valid movie lists for Screen 1, as sci-fi film can be shown on Screen 1 and does not have any restrictions regarding the horror film.
  Choice C is a valid movie list for Screen 1 since the western, which starts before the horror film, needs to be before the horror film.
  Choice D is a valid movie list for Screen 1. The western movie needs to start before the horror movie and the mystery movie need to be on separate screens. So, mystery can be shown in Screen 2 and western can be shown in Screen 1.
  Choice B cannot be a valid list because Screen 2 cannot have the romance movie (per the rules) and the mystery and horror movies cannot be shown on the same screen (per the rules).

Action: Answer("B")

- Option C is possible because the western can be shown on screen 1, and the horror film can be shown on screen 2.
- Option D is possible because the western can be shown on screen 1, and the mystery can be shown on screen 2.
- Option E is not possible because the western cannot be shown with the sci-fi film on screen 1, as the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, where only one movie is displayed at 8 P.M.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1, 2, and 3 show two movies (7 PM and 9 PM), one movie (8 PM), and one movie (8 PM), respectively.
 
1. Sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. Thus, it will be shown on either screen 1 or 2.
2. The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it will be shown either on screen 1 or 3.
3. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so Horror and Mystery movies cannot be on screen 1 together. Therefore, one of them must be shown on either screen 2 or 3.
4. There must be a pair of movies (one at 7 PM and one at 9 PM) shown on Screen 1 and 2, respectively. 
5. As the western is shown before horror, it could be shown at 7 PM on screen 1 or 2. 
 
Option A: The sci-fi movie and the horror movie are the movies shown on screen 1.
Both sci-fi and horror films cannot be shown on screen 1 simultaneously because one 7 PM movie and one 9 PM movie must be shown on screen 1. Thus, option A is not possible.
 
Option B: The sci-fi movie and the mystery movie are the movies shown on screen 1.
The sci-fi movie would then be shown on Screen 2 at 7 PM, but the romance is not shown on screen 2. So, option B is not possible.
 
Option C: The western and the horror movie are the movies shown on screen 1.
If the Western is on screen 1, it must be at 7 PM and the horror movie must be on either screen 2 or 3. This option is possible. 
 
Option D: The western and the mystery movie are the movies shown on screen 1.
If the Western is on screen 1, it must be at 7 PM and the mystery movie must be on either screen 2 or 3. This option is possible.
 
Option E: The western and the sci-fi movie are the movies shown on screen 1.
If the Western is shown on screen 1, it cannot be the sci-fi movie at 7 PM because the romance is not shown on screen 2. So, option E is not possible.
 
Answer: Option A.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly five movies are showing: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  - Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  - Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  - The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  - The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  - The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  - The horror and the mystery are shown on different screens.

We are looking for a list of movies that CANNOT be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first. 

Option A is possible. The sci-fi movie can be shown at 7 PM on screen 1 and the Horror film can be shown at 9 PM on screen 1.

Option B is possible. The sci-fi movie can be shown at 7 PM on screen 1 and the mystery can be shown at 9 PM on screen 1.

Option C is possible. The western film can be shown at 7 PM on screen 1 and horror can be shown at 9 PM on screen 1.

Option D is possible. The western film can be shown at 7 PM on screen 1 and the mystery can be shown at 9 PM on screen 1.

Option E is not possible since it has the western and the sci-fi film on screen 1, but the western and the sci-fi film cannot be both on screen 1. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are three screens at the repertory theater for showing five different movies.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Elimination: 
  The western must be shown first on either screen 1 or screen 2, but not on screen 3. 
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. 
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
  A: The horror film is not shown on screen 1 as well as the mystery (since they are shown on different screens). Hence, the sci-fi and the horror films could be shown on screen 1 in either order. This option could represent two accurate lists. So, this option is not the answer.
  
  B: the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1 since one of the movies must be shown at 7 P.M. and the other one at 9 P.M. Since the western, the romance, the horror film, and the mystery all have to be shown on screen 1, and the sci-fi cannot be shown, this option cannot be accurate.

  C: This is the most accurate list of movies to be shown on screen 1, so this option is not the answer.

  D: This is an accurate list of movies for screen 1 with the western starting at 7 P.M. and the mystery starting at 9 P.M. Hence, this option is not the answer.
  
  E: The western can only be shown first on screen 1 or 2, so it is not possible to show the western and the sci-fi film on screen 1 together. This option cannot be accurate.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Let's see what would contradict the given conditions:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (this is possible since it is not mentioned that they cannot work in the same zone)
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (this is possible)
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (this is possible)
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. (this is not possible since both Tiao and Udall cannot work in Zone 2)
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. (Parra or Tiao but not both should work in Zone 1, so this is not possible.)
 
Action: Answer("D") since we know that Mahr and Udall cannot both work in Zone 3.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are exactly three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

A: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 2, along with Udall, leaving Zone 3 with Mahr as the only employee. This contradicts the statement that there are more employees in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, A must be false.
B: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then Parra and Quinn must also work in that zone, leaving only three employees for the other two zones. This is consistent with the statement that there are more employees in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. But this does not mean that B must be true. Therefore, B may or may not be a correct answer.
C: If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least three employees in that zone, which contradicts the statement that there are more employees in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, C must be false.
D: If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least three employees in that zone, which is consistent with the statement that there are more employees in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. But this does not mean that D must be true. Therefore, D may or may not be a correct answer.
E: If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2, and one or more of the other employees must work in Zone 3. This is consistent with the statement that there are more employees in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, E must be false.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are seven employees working in the sales zones: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  There are three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

A: Kim and Stuckey can not both work in Zone 1 because only one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
B: Kim and Stuckey can not both work in Zone 3 because one the other sales representatives (Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Tiao, or Udall) has to work in Zone 1. Moreover, Zone 2 is less populated than Zone 3, so Kim and Stuckey must not be in the same less populated Zone 2.
C: Mahr and Stuckey can both work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in that zone.
D: Mahr and Udall can both work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in that zone.
E: Parra and Stuckey can not both work in Zone 1 because only one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and there is no way Stuckey can work in both Zone 1 and Zone 3.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
A: Kim and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
B: Kim and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 3 because there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and since Kim and Stuckey work in the same zone, they cannot occupy two of the three sales zones. 
C: It is possible for Mahr and Stuckey to both work in Zone 3 because it is only stated that there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 but it does not specify how many representatives work in Zone 3.
D: It is possible for Mahr and Udall to both work in Zone 3 since it is not given where Udall works.
E: Parra and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Solution:
  From conditions (1) and (3), Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  From condition (2), either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  From condition (4), Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other in either Zone 1, Zone 2, or Zone 3.
  From condition (5), Zone 3 has more sales representatives than Zone 2. 

  A: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there would be no sales representatives to work in Zone 3, which contradicts condition (5). Therefore, (A) is not possible.
  B: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there would be no sales representatives to work in Zone 1, which contradicts condition (1). Therefore, (B) is not possible.
  C: If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there would be no sales representatives to work in Zone 1, which contradicts condition (1). Therefore, (C) is not possible.
  D: If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then Mahr, Udall, and one of Parra or Tiao would all have to work in Zone 3, which contradicts condition (5). Therefore, (D) is not possible.
  E: If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there would be no sales representatives to work in Zone 3, which contradicts condition (5). Therefore, (E) is not possible.

Answer: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The question is about assigning sales representatives to three sales zones while satisfying a set of conditions involving specific sales representatives working in specific zones and restrictions on combinations of sales representatives working in the same zone.

  A: Kim and Stuckey both working in Zone 1 would violate the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  B: There are two sales representatives in Zone 2 at most, and since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it is impossible for both Kim and Stuckey to work in Zone 3.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both working in Zone 3 is possible as it does not violate any condition.
  D: Mahr and Udall both working in Zone 3 is possible as it does not violate any condition.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both working in Zone 1 is a valid possibility, and it does not violate any condition.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  The company has three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis: 
  A: Kim and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 1 since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and neither of them is Kim or Stuckey. Therefore, A is false.
  B: Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Kim and Stuckey cannot work in the same zone, it must be the case that Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. Therefore, B is true, and it cannot be the answer.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey could both work in Zone 3 since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, C is not necessarily false.
  D: Mahr and Udall could both work in Zone 3 since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, D is not necessarily false.
  E: Parra cannot work in Zone 1 since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Stuckey cannot work in Zone 1 since he works with Udall in the same zone, who is not Parra or Tiao. Therefore, E is false.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

The answer to the question must be an option that cannot be true based on the conditions given.

Option A: There is no information given to determine whether Kim and Stuckey work in Zone 1. So, it could be true or false.
Option B: There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, it is possible that Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. So, it is not false. So, this is not the answer.
Option C: There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, it is possible that Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. So, this is not the answer.
Option D: There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, it is possible that Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. So, this is not the answer.
Option E: The information given does not require Parra and Stuckey to work in the same sales zone. So, it is possible that they work in different sales zones. So, this is not the answer.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are three zones (Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3) where seven sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall) work.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
Let's apply each statement to the given conditions:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. --> False. Only one person (either Parra or Tiao) can work in Zone 1.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. --> True. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Stuckey works in Zone 3.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. --> False. It is not stated which zone Mahr works in.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. --> False. Stuckey is the only person who's confirmed to work in the same zone as Udall.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. --> False. Parra works either in Zone 1 or in another zone.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The company has 7 sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall) and 3 sales zones (Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3).
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Analysis:
  If each of the sales representatives is assigned to a specific sales zone, we can check each option's likelihood of being true or false.
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1 - This must be False since neither Kim nor Stuckey has been assigned to work in Zone 1.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3 - This might be true since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3 - This might be true since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3 - This might be true since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I - This is not possible since only one of Parra or Tiao can work in Zone 1.

Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese.
- The pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days - There are six breeds in total, and Himalayans are the only breed featured in exactly three days. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are - We only know that Himalayans appear on exactly three days but we don’t know which specific days. Therefore, we cannot confirm if B is true or not.
C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are - Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so this cannot be true.
D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not - This cannot be true since we know that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore D is not correct.
E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not - This can be true since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly three breeds of kitten and three breeds of puppy are featured over exactly seven days.
  - The breeds that are featured on each day are unique.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
Checking each choice:
  A: It can't be true, because only three breeds of each animal are featured in total.
  B: If Greyhounds are featured on day 2 or day 3 (when Himalayans are also featured), then this would not be true. But if Greyhounds are only featured on day 1 and Himalayans are only featured on days 4, 5, and 6, then this statement would be true. Therefore, it could be true.
  C: This can't be true because Greyhounds and Himalayans are featured on different days.
  D: This can't be true because Rottweilers are featured on day 7 but Himalayans are not.
  E: This could be true if Rottweilers are featured on days 2 and 3 and Himalayans are not featured on those days. Therefore, it could be true.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  * 7 consecutive days each feature exactly one of three breeds of kitten: Himalayan, Manx, Siamese
  * 7 consecutive days each feature exactly one of three breeds of puppy: Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler
  * The following conditions must apply:
    * Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
    * No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
    * Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
    * Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
    * Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: It is stated that Himalayans are the only breed featured on exactly three days.
B: There is no mention of a relationship between Greyhounds and Himalayans.
C: There is no mention of a relationship between Greyhounds and Himalayans.
D: It is stated that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
E: While there is no explicit statement of this sort, this could be true because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies.
  The schedule of the breeds follows the following Rule:
   - Day 1: Greyhounds
   - No two consecutive days can feature the same breed.
   - Day 1's breed cannot appear on Day 7.
   - Himalayans are featured on exactly 3 days.
   - Rottweilers cannot appear with Himalayans and cannot be on Day 7.
 
A: Since there are only three breeds of puppies and three breeds of kittens, if four breeds were each featured for three days, then one breed would have to be repeated, breaking the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, A is not possible.
B: According to the rules, Greyhounds appear on Day 1. If Himalayans appear on every day that Greyhounds appear, that means Himalayans appear on Day 1, which is against the given condition. Therefore, B is not possible.
C: According to the rules, Himalayans cannot be on Day 1, so this option is not possible.
D: If Himalayans appear on every day that Rottweilers are not, then on the three days the Himalayans are featured, the Rottweilers must not appear. According to the rules, Rottweilers are not featured on Day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, D is possible.
E: If Rottweilers appear on each day that Himalayans are not, then there would have to be some breeds that are featured on consecutive days, which is in contravention of the given condition. Therefore, E is not possible. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), and each of the days has exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler.
  - Greyhounds are featured every day.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
  - Since Greyhounds are featured every day and no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, we can assume that the breed featured on day 1 cannot be featured on day 3, 5, and 7. Moreover, the breed featured on day 7 cannot be featured on day 5, 3, and 1.
  - Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, there must be only one breed that is featured on three days along with Himalayans. Also, the breed that is featured on three days along with Himalayans cannot be Rottweilers, as Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- On each of exactly seven consecutive days, one of three breeds of kitten and one of three breeds of puppy are featured.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Choice A contradicts the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days.
- Choice B contradicts the condition that Greyhounds are featured on day 1, but not on day 7.
- Choice C contradicts the condition that Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
- Choice D is consistent with the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
- Choice E is consistent with the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on day 7.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Exactly 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies are featured over 7 days with each breed being featured once per day.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - The breed that is featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A cannot be true since there are only 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies. Each breed can be featured at most three times.

Analysis:
  - Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, the other two breeds of cats must be featured on two days each. Therefore, there must be two breeds of puppies that are also featured on two days each. 
  - According to the rules, Rottweilers cannot be featured on the same day as Himalayans.
  - Greyhounds and one of the two breeds of puppies that are featured on two days each must be featured on the same set of days when Himalayans are featured, since Himalayans are not featured on day 1. This means that the other breed of puppies featured on two days each cannot be featured on those days.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- There are three breeds of kitten (Himalayan, Manx, Siamese).
- There are three breeds of puppy (Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler).
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- If we have "exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days," then we would need at least 12 days (4 breeds x 3 days/breed) but there are only 7 days available.
- If "Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are," then since Himalayans are not featured on day 1, the Greyhounds can only be featured on day 3. But this would violate the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, since the Greyhounds were featured on day 1.
- If "Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are," then since the Himalayans are not featured on day 1, they cannot be featured on any day that the Greyhounds are featured. This means that Himalayans can only be featured on days 2, 4, and 6. However, this violates the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Specifically, Rottweilers cannot be featured on any of those three days (2, 4, or 6), so this cannot be true.
- If "Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not," then Himalayans cannot be featured on Day 7 (since Rottweilers are not featured on Day 7). Therefore, Himalayans must be featured on Days 2-4-6. In this case, Rottweilers can only be featured on Days 2 and 4. Therefore, on Day 3, two breeds, neither of which is a Rottweiler, must be featured. Moreover, on Day 5, one of the breeds featured must be a Rottweiler (since there are no more days for a Rottweiler feature). Therefore, it is possible for Rottweilers to be featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
- If "Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not," then we run into a problem on Days 2, 4, and 6: on those days, Himalayans need to be one of the featured breeds, but they cannot be if we are featuring Rottweilers. Therefore, this option cannot be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Over the course of 7 days, two breeds of kitten and two breeds of puppy are featured.
- Each breed of kitten and puppy is featured exactly once on each of the seven days.
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on two consecutive days.
- A breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, none of which are day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 and not on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Each breed can appear in at most three groups across the seven days, so it is impossible for four breeds to be featured on exactly three days each.
- Himalayans can only be featured on a maximum of three days, therefore they cannot be featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
- Himalayans are not featured on day 1, therefore it is not possible for them to be featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.

Action: Answer("E") 
Therefore, the only possible option is that Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are 3 breeds of kittens (Himalayan, Manx, Siamese) and 3 breeds of puppies (Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler).
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
Analysis:
  One mathematical way to solve this problem is by using a matrix (or table) to assign each breed to a day.
  The following matrix shows one possible solution for this problem:
  
           | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 | Day 6 | Day 7 |
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Kittens   |    -  |  H   |   M   |  S    |   -   |  H    |   S   |
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Puppies   |  G    |   -   |   R   |   N   |  G    |  N    |   -   |
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

Action: Answer("B")  
  'Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.' is true for the table above (Himalayans are featured on day 2, 6, and 7 while Greyhounds are featured on day 1, 5, and 7).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 3 clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - There are 2 service targets (one for website requests and one for voicemail requests) for each client.
  - The targets are: 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  - Two conditions: (1) None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. (2) Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Another condition: Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

For this question:
  - If none of the clients have a voicemail target of 3 days, that means that all clients have a voicemail target of 2 days or less.
  - According to the third condition, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days.
  - Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days. That means Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - From the second and third condition together, we can conclude that the targets for Solide and Truvest are: Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target, and Truvest's voicemail target is longer than Solide's voicemail target.
  - Therefore, Solide's targets are either (2d, 1d) or (2d, 2d); Truvest's targets are either (2d, 1d) or (1d, 1d).

  - Answer choice A, Image's website target is 1 day, is a possible scenario. Image's targets can be (2d, 1d).
  - Answer choice B, Solide's website target is 2 days, is a possible scenario. Solide's targets can be (2d, 1d) or (2d, 2d).
  - Answer choice C, Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, is a possible scenario. Solide's targets can be (2d, 1d) or (2d, 2d).
  - Answer choice D, Truvest's website target is 2 days, is not a possible scenario because either Solide's website target is 1 day (and Truvest's target is 2 days) or Solide's website target is 2 days (and Truvest's target is 1 day).
  - Answer choice E, Truvest's voicemail target is  2 days, is a possible scenario. Truvest's targets can be (2d, 1d) or (1d, 1d).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest. 
- Service targets were set for each client, with two targets for each— one for requests through the maintenance company's website, and another for requests received by voicemail.
- The targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day, and conditions govern their setting.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- We are asked to identify an option that is not true given that none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days.

Elimination Approach:
- Option A implies that Image’s voicemail target is at most 2 days since the website target is not allowed to be longer than the voicemail target. Therefore, Image's voicemail target is either 1 or 2 days.
- Option B is true since Solide’s website target must be shorter than that of Truvest, which Means Solide’s website target must be 2 days or shorter.
- Option C indicates that Solide's voicemail target is 2 days. However, if Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients’ voicemail targets, it is possible for Solide's voicemail target to be 1 day. So, Option C is not always true.
- Option D states that Truvest's website target is 2 days, which is true by definition. Since it must be longer than Solide's website target, which can be at most 2 days.
- Option E contradicts option C since only one of Solide and Truvest can have a voicemail target of 2 days. So, Option E is not always true.

Therefore, Answer: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The question refers to a scenario involving a maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voice mail target. Image's voice mail target must be shorter than the other clients' voice mail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
A: We don't have enough information to determine if this statement is true.
B: Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. If Truvest has a website target of 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day. This statement is true.
C: Solide's voicemail target must be shorter than Truvest's voicemail target. If none of the clients have a voicemail target of 3 days, then both Solide and Truvest must have a voicemail target of 2 days. This statement is true.
D: Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. If Truvest has a website target of 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day. This statement is false because Truvest's website target may be 3 days.
E: Truvest's voicemail target must be shorter than its website target. If Truvest has a website target of 2 days, then its voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days. This statement is true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- There are three clients - Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- Two service targets are set for each client - one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, the following must be true:
- Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- Solide's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- Truvest's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
- None of the clients has a website target of 3 days.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Now, let's check each option:
A: If Image's website target is 1 day, that means its voicemail target can only be 1 day or 2 days, which satisfies the given conditions. So, this option is possible.
B: Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. It means Solide's website target can only be 1 day as Truvest's website target can only be 2 days or 1 day. Therefore, this option is also possible.
C: If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, that means its website target can only be 1 day. It satisfies the given conditions. So, this option is also possible.
D: Truvest's website target can only be 2 days or 1 day. So, this option is possible.
E: Truvest's voicemail target can only be 1 day or 2 days. Therefore, this option is also possible.

As we have checked all the given options and all of them appear to be possible, the answer is None of the Above.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The maintenance company has 3 clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  - Two service targets are set for each client (website and voicemail).
  - Service targets are either 3, 2, or 1 day(s).
  - Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target.
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Action: 
  - If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be either 2 or 1 day. So, Image's website target must be either 1 or 2 days (because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target). 
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. So, if Truvest's website target is 2 days, Solide's website target must be 1 or 2 days. In either case, Solide's voicemail target can be 1 or 2 days, but it is not guaranteed to be 2 days. 
  - Therefore, the answer is C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, which is not necessarily true.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The maintenance company sets 6 service targets, 2 for each of the 3 clients, according to the following conditions: None of the clients have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  If the client has no voicemail target of 3 days, this means that the longest voicemail target is 2 days since the maintenance company sets three service targets - 3 days, 2 days, and 1 day.
  
  If a client's voicemail target is x days, then its website target must be less than or equal to x days. 

Analysis:
  A: If Image's website target is 1 day, it means its voicemail target is also 1 day (because the voicemail target is shorter than the website target). This is possible because the maximum number of days for a voicemail target is 2 days, which is longer than 1 day. Therefore, A can be true.
  B: Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. If Truvest's website target is 2 days, Solide's website target cannot be 2 days or longer. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day. This means Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, which is possible because the maximum number of days for a voicemail target is 2. Therefore, B can be true.
  C: If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, then its website target must be less than or equal to 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day, which cannot be longer than Truvest's website target. Therefore, C can be true.
  D: If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then its voicemail target must be less than or equal to 2 days. Therefore, Truvest's voicemail target can be either 1 day or 2 days. Therefore, D can be true.
  E: Since Truvest's website target is longer than or equal to Solide's website target, and Solide's website target is 1 day, Truvest's website target can be either 2 days or 1 day. If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then its voicemail target must also be 1 day (because the voicemail target is shorter than the website target). Therefore, E can be true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - Six service targets are set (2 per client) for the maintenance company's service request response times.
  - Targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, and 1 day.
  - Conditions for setting targets are:
      1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
      2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
      3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  We are given that none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days.
  
  A: We don't have any information regarding Image's website target.
  B: We don't have any information regarding Solide's website target.
  C: It is possible for Solide to have a voicemail target of 2 days, which means Solide's website target has to be either 1 day or 2 days. This statement may be true.
  D: If Solide's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days. This statement is likely to be true.
  E: Truvest's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days. It is possible for Truvest to have a voicemail target of 2 days. This statement may be true.

Action: Answer("C") as it is possible for Solide to have a voicemail target of 2 days.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The three clients are Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  Each target is either 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.
  
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, that means the voicemail targets for each client are either 1 day or 2 days.
  Also, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's website target must be either 2 days or 3 days.
  Since none of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target, and Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, we can say that Image's website target must be 1 day, Solide's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's website target must be 2 days.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Truvest's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days, which means Truvest's website target must be 2 days. Additionally, Solide's voicemail target must be less than 3 days, which means that Solide's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days. Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, then Solide's website target must be 2 days and we can eliminate choice B. Moreover, since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, the other two clients must have voicemail targets of 2 days, which means Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. As a result, Image's website target must also be 1 day, because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, the only exception to the statements made is that Image's website target must be 1 day. Hence, the answer is A) Image's website target is 1 day.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The six targets are set according to conditions such that:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then:
  - Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  - Solide's and Truvest's voicemail targets are either 1 day or 2 days.
- For the website targets:
  - Image's website target is either 1 day or 2 days. It cannot be 3 days because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must be 1 day and Truvest's website target must be 2 days, or Solide's website target must be 2 days and Truvest's website target must be 3 days.

A: Image's website target can be either 1 day or 2 days, so it can be true. 
B: Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must be 1 day and so it is true.
C: Solide's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days because none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, so it can be true. 
D: Truvest's website target must be either 2 days or 3 days; it cannot be 1 day because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, it is not true that Truvest's website target is 2 days.
E: Truvest's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days because none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, so it can be true. 

Therefore, the answer is D) Truvest's website target is 2 days as it contradicts the conditions that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- A total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, it means there are no photographs by Gagnon in the Lifestyle section.

Let's check each option:

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.  
- If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, and one photograph in the Lifestyle section needs to be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, then the only option is that the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes is in the same section as one of Fuentes' Metro photographs, which does not leave any more Metro spots available for Fuentes. Therefore, this option is not possible.

B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.  
- If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, and one photograph in the Lifestyle section needs to be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, then the remaining photographers who could have a photo in the Metro section are Gagnon and Hue. Therefore, this option is possible.

C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
- If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, both Fuentes and Hue need to have photographs in the other sections, respectively. However, this option would mean that Fuentes has a photograph in the Sports section, which contradicts the fact that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, this option is not possible.

D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
- If Hue has two photographs in the Sports section, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must also be by Hue. However, we know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. Therefore, this option is not possible.

E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
- If the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then both of Fuentes' photographs would also need to be in the Sports section. Therefore, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs are to appear, 2 per section, in Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections. 
  - Only three photographers (Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue) are available.
  - Each photographer needs to have a minimum of one photo, and maximum of three.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be from a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. 
  - Number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle = Number of Fuentes photographs in Sports.
  - Gagnon's photos cannot be in the Sports section.

Since one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, we can make the following conclusions:
- Fuentes has at least one photograph. 
- Hue has at least one photograph.
- Neither photographer has all three photographs in any section.
- One photograph in metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
- Since Fuentes has a photo in Lifestyle section, at least one photograph in the Metro Section, must be by Fuentes for the condition "at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be from a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section" to be met.

A: If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then Fuentes will have at least 3 photographs, which is not possible.
B: If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then Fuentes who has one photograph must have a photograph in the Sports section to meet the requirement that number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle = Number of Fuentes photos in Sports, which is not possible. Hence, this option is also not possible.
C: If exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, then the other photograph must be by Fuentes, to have one photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section and since both have only one photo in Metro section, this option is possible.
D: Since Hue already has a photo in the Lifestyle section and number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle = Number of Fuentes photographs in Sports, Hue can have only one photo in the Sports section and therefore this option is not possible.
E: Since Hue already has a photo in the Lifestyle section and number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle = Number of Fuentes photographs in Sports, Fuentes can have only one photo in the Sports section. So, this option is possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs will appear, two in each of the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  - Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photos appearing.
  - At least one Lifestyle photograph must be by a photographer with at least one photo in Metro.
  - Number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle must match number of Fuentes's photos in Sports.
  - Gagnon cannot have photographs in Sports.
  
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue:
    - Fuentes has one photo in Lifestyle
    - Hue has one photo in Lifestyle
    - Therefore, neither Fuentes nor Hue can have more than two photos total (one in Lifestyle, one in either Metro or Sports)
    - There must be a photographer who has at least one photograph in both Lifestyle and Metro sections. This leaves two possibilities: Fuentes and Gagnon, or Hue and Gagnon. 
  
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. (Not possible, if Fuentes has a photo in Lifestyle)
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. (Possible, since Fuentes and Hue have one photo each in Lifestyle, no more than 2 photos for either photographer.)
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. (Not possible, if Hue has a photo in Lifestyle, they must have one in either Metro or Sports)
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. (Not possible, since Hue only has one photo in Lifestyle)
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. (Possible, since Fuentes has one photo in Lifestyle, Hue has one photo in Lifestyle, and the number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle must match the number of Fuentes's photos in Sports.) 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- There are 6 different photographs: 2 in each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
- 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
- The remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be taken by either Gagnon or Fuentes.
- The photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section corresponds to a photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section.
- One photograph in the Metro section must be taken by Fuentes (to fulfill the condition that there is at least one photographer who has a photograph in both Lifestyle and Metro sections).
- The other photograph in the Metro section must be taken by either Gagnon or Hue.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Considering these constraints:
A: This is not possible because we need at least one photograph in the Metro section to be taken by Hue.
B: This is not possible because we need at least one photograph in the Metro section to be taken by Fuentes.
C: This is possible. In this case, the other photograph in the Metro section must be taken by Gagnon.
D: This is not possible because the photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section corresponds to a photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section.
E: This is possible. In this case, both photographs in the Sports section must be taken by Fuentes.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - A total of six different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section in the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper.
  - Photographs are taken by three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - At least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then that means no photographs in the Lifestyle section can be taken by Gagnon since each photographer's photographs are limited to between 1-3 photographs in total. Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section is either taken by Fuentes or Hue. 
The other photographer whose photos appear in this particular issue must be between Gagnon and Fuentes since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. That means one of Fuentes/Hue is in the Metro section while the other is in Sports section.
From the given options, only C satisfies this constraint since it states exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue which could be true if the photograph of Fuentes is in the Sports section. The other options violate one or more of the given constraints.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  2. Each of the 3 photographers has 1 to 3 photographs that could be selected.
  3. There are 6 photographs in total, with 2 per section.
  4. There are 3 sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  5. At least one Lifestyle photograph and one Metro photograph must be taken by a photographer who has at least one photograph in both sections.
  6. Fuentes must have the same number of photographs in Sports as Hue has in Lifestyle.
  7. Gagnon cannot have photographs in Sports.
  
Action: Answer("C")  

Reasoning: 
  If one photograph in Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, we know that Gagnon must have both photographs in Sports or have no photographs in Sports. We also know that in the Metro section, there needs to be at least one photograph by a photographer who has photographs in both sections. If both photographs in Metro section are by Fuentes, then the remaining photograph in Lifestyle section should be by Gagnon (if not, there is no photographer to appear in both Lifestyle and Metro). Therefore, it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. This satisfies all the given conditions.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
- Six different photographs need to be selected, with exactly two photographs per section.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, there are a few possibilities to consider. To satisfy the conditions, one photograph in the Lifestyle and one photograph in the Sports must be by Fuentes and Hue respectively. The photograph left for Fuentes should be in the Metro section, so there is one photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes and one photograph in the Sports section by Fuentes. This means that neither photograph in the Metro section can be taken by Fuentes. Also, none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, the remaining two photographs in the Metro section must be taken by Hue and Gagnon, which includes the possibility of having exactly one photograph in the Metro section taken by Hue. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports) needs exactly two photographs.
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - Each photographer must have at least one photograph but no more than three in each section.
  - Lifestyle must have one photograph from a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro.
  - Hue's photographs in Lifestyle must be same as Fuentes' in Sports.
  - No Gagnon's photos in Sports.
  
  Since one photograph in Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that at least one photo in Metro section is by Fuentes or Hue.

A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. - Not possible as there must be at least one photo from a photographer other than Fuentes who has a photo in Metro, as per the rule that Lifestyle must have a photo from a photographer who has at least one photo in Metro.
B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - Not possible as we already know that at least one photo in Metro section is by Fuentes or Hue.
C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. - Possible. One photo in Lifestyle is by Fuentes, so we can have one photo by Hue in Lifestyle and one photo by Fuentes in Sports. Then one photo in Metro by Hue and one by Gagnon. That satisfies all the rules.
D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - Not possible as it would mean that there are no Fuentes' photos in Sports, which contradicts the rule that Hue's photos in Lifestyle must be same as Fuentes' in Sports.
E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - Not possible as per the rule that Hue's photos in Lifestyle must be same as Fuentes' in Sports. 

Action: Answer("C") - Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Total 6 photos: 2 per section in each of the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections.
  2. Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  3. At least one but no more than three photos per photographer.
  4. At least one photographer has to appear in both Lifestyle and Metro sections.
  5. The number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section equals the number of Fuentes's photos in the Sports section.
  6. No Gagnon's photos in the Sports section.

Since we know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, we can derive some information.
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, that means one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, but there are the total of 2 photographs in the Metro section, so the other photograph in the Metro section cannot be by Hue. Thus, Gagnon must have a photograph in the Metro section. Since there are only two photos in the Lifestyle section and one is by Fuentes, the other photo must be by Gagnon, as we cannot have more than one photo by any photographer here. So, Fuentes's photographs must be in only one of the Metro or Lifestyle sections, but not both. Also, since one photo in the Lifestyle section is by Hue and there cannot be more than three photos per photographer, Hue must have one photo in each the Metro and Sports sections. Finally, since there can be at least one but no more than three photos per photographer and we know that Hue has a photo in each section, only Gagnon can have two photos in the last section and none in the first section, which satisfies all given conditions.

Actions: 
As we have derived the given conditions, we can now answer the question by selecting the option that follows the determined conditions.
Answer("E") Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each section, Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports, will have exactly two different photographs.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three photographs of that photographer will appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section will be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can appear in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("C")
Explanation: 
  Since exactly one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section and one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one of those photographers must also have a photographic in the Metro section. Therefore, any option in which the photographers of the photographs in Metro are both Fuentes (option A) or both Gagnon (option B) is not possible. Hue's photograph in Lifestyle means Hue has at least one photograph in Lifestyle. Then the number of photos of Hue in Lifestyle should be equal to the number of photos of Fuentes in Sports. Let's say it is x. If Hue has x photos in Lifestyle and one of these photos is in the Metro section then a maximum of two photos of Fuentes will be available for Sports including the possibility none of them in the Sports section. If both photos in Sports were Hue's, then Fuentes would need to have all the other photos available to choose from for Lifestyle and Metro sections, leaving no other photos available for the other sections.
  Therefore, just one photograph of Hue in Lifestyle section, and corresponding to this, Hue will have at most one photo in the Metro section. Thus, Hue can have one photo in Lifestyle and one in Metro, possibly being the same photograph. Hence, C is true, which says “Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.”.
  Note: None of the options D and E is possible since we know from the given information that "The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section."

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 
  Mollie ≠ 1921, 1923, 1924
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Tiffany → Ryan
  Ryan → Onyx - 1
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  
Analysis: 
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, that means that either Louis or Yoshio must be assigned to 1922. 
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then it is not possible for Louis, Tiffany, Ryan or Yoshio to be assigned to 1922. However, it is still possible to assign any one of those students to 1921, 1923 or 1924. 
  Not enough information is given about Onyx's assignment.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: Answer("D") 

If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's which is 1922. Since Mollie must be assigned to the project, and she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, the answer is D) Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are 4 years in the project: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  6 students are available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must also be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
  A: Louis is assigned to year 1924. This assignment is independent of all the other conditions, so it does not affect the assignment of Mollie. Eliminate A.
  B: Onyx is assigned to year 1921. This creates a conflict because Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921. Eliminate B.
  C: Onyx is assigned to year 1924. This doesn't affect the assignment of Mollie. However, based on the condition "If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's", Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and in turn, Tiffany must also be assigned to 1923. This conflicts with the condition "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923". Eliminate C.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to year 1923. This means Ryan has to be assigned to any of the years in 1921, 1922, or 1924, but none of those years is the year immediately prior to Onyx. Eliminate D.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to year 1921. This means Mollie must be assigned to year 1922 by the condition "If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922". Yoshio and Onyx must then fill the remaining years: 1923 and 1924 (order doesn't matter). This satisfies all the conditions. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The project has 4 years: 1921, 1922, 1923 and 1924.
- Six students are available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Solution:
We need to determine what scenario will force Mollie to be in 1922. 
- If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Mollie can be assigned to 1921, Tiffany can be assigned to 1923 and Onyx can be assigned to 1922 (since Ryan is not assigned).
- If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 according to the condition, so this option is eliminated.
- If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Ryan will be assigned to 1923 according to Tiffany's condition. Thus, Onyx will be assigned to 1922 and Mollie will be assigned to 1921.
- If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan's condition states that he must be assigned to the project. But if Ryan is assigned to 1923, then he would have been assigned to the year immediately prior to Onyx, which contradicts with Ryan's condition. Hence, this option is eliminated.
- If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie will be assigned to 1922 according to her condition. Tiffany will be assigned to 1923, Ryan to 1924 and Onyx to 1921.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- There are six students available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio
- The project has four years: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924
- Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's

Analysis:
- If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Louis would have to be assigned to 1924, but we know only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 and Louis cannot be assigned to 1924.
- If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis can only be assigned to 1921 and Tiffany can only be assigned to 1923. This satisfies all the conditions, so Mollie must be assigned to 1922.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Mollie is assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.

Analyzing each choice: 
  A: Louis can be assigned to 1924, and it doesn't contradict any of the given conditions. Therefore, Mollie does not have to be assigned to 1922.
  B: Onyx can be assigned to 1921, but there is no information regarding Mollie's assignment.
  C: Onyx can be assigned to 1924, but there is no information regarding Mollie's assignment.
  D: Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, but this means that Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, so Mollie must be assigned to 1922. This choice satisfies the given conditions.
  E: Yoshio can be assigned to 1921, but again there is no information regarding Mollie's assignment.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. This choice does not impose any restrictions for Mollie's assignment.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. This choice does not impose any restrictions for Mollie's assignment.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. This choice does not impose any restrictions for Mollie's assignment.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. This choice means that Louis cannot be assigned to 1923. Since Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922, and Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921 (otherwise, Ryan could not be assigned to the year immediately prior to Onyx's), then Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. This choice does not impose any restrictions for Mollie's assignment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- There are four years (1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924) and four students assigned to them, each year being assigned exactly one student.
- If Mollie is assigned, it must be to either 1921 or 1922.
- Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: Answer("D")

If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then the other two years must be assigned to Louis and Mollie. The only year left for Mollie to be assigned to in this case is 1922. 

Thus, if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, Mollie must be assigned to 1922. The correct answer is D.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Mollie has to be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924. Nothing is indicated about Mollie's or the other students' assignments based on this.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. This does not affect Mollie's assignment or the others.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. This does not affect Mollie's assignment or the others.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned, and this will affect the assignments of others, but this does not tell us whether Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. This does not affect Mollie's assignment or the others.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The students Louis and Tiffany cannot be assigned together to the year 1923.
- The student Mollie cannot be assigned to the year 1924.
- The student Ryan is assigned to a year, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. 
- The student Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- The question states that Mollie must be assigned to the year 1922.

A: Louis is assigned to 1924: This choice does not provide any information regarding Mollie's assignment.
B: Onyx is assigned to 1921: If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922. This is the same year stated in the question, so this would be the correct answer.
C: Onyx is assigned to 1924: This choice does not provide any information regarding Mollie's assignment.
D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923: This cannot be the case because Louis and Tiffany cannot be assigned together to the year 1923.
E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921: This choice does not provide any information regarding Mollie's assignment.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We know that there is a total of six bays and six types of cargo. 
  Bay 4 is holding produce, and textiles is next to produce. So, The bays holding textiles and produce are Bay 3 and Bay 4 not necessarily in this order. And the bays holding produce, fuel and textiles are all together.
  Based on the hierarchy of the bays on the dock, using a process of elimination, we can arrange them and find out the corresponding types of cargo being held in each bay:
  Bay 6 ->  Livestock
  Bay 5 ->  Machinery
  Bay 4 -> Produce
  Bay 3 ->  Textiles
  Bay 2 ->  Fuel
  Bay 1 ->  Grain
  
Action: Answer("D")  five. We can determine the types of cargos on the bays 1, 2, 5, 6.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 6 bays numbered 1 to 6 holding 6 types of cargo - fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - Bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Working through the clues:
 - Bay 4 is holding produce. That means, bay 5 must hold textiles, and bay 3 would hold fuel.
 - Bay holding livestock must have a lower number than the bay holding textiles. But we don't know which bay is holding livestock. Assuming Sun - Sat numbering convention, livestock can be in bay 1, 2 or 3. 
 - We also know that the bay holding grain will be higher than the bay holding livestock, which also narrows down the possibilities. Let's check them one by one:
    * If livestock is in bay 3, then grain must be in bay 1 and machinery must be in bay 2.
    * If livestock is in bay 2, then grain must be in bay 1 and machinery must be in bay 3.
    * If livestock is in bay 1, then grain must be in bay 2 and machinery must be in bay 3.

In all three cases, only three bays (4, 5, and 6) have a determined type of cargo.
So the answer is: 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 to 6 is numbered consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
  Each bay is holding one of exactly six types of cargo (fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles).
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
If bay 4 is holding produce, then we can get some deductions from the rules:
- From the rule "The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce", we can deduce that Bay 3 is holding textiles.
- From the rule "The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel", we can deduce that from Bays 1,2, and 3, none is holding produce since they have a lower number than Bay 4, and Bay 5 is holding fuel since it has a lower number than Bay 6.
- From the rule "The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles" and Bay 3 is holding textiles, we can deduce that Bay 2 is holding livestock and Bay 1 is holding grain.
Therefore, only for 3 bays, the type of cargo is completely determined, produce in Bay 4, livestock in Bay 2, and grain in Bay 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  We do not have information about the cargo type in each bay, but certain bays can be eliminated for holding certain cargo due to the given criteria. 

Process:
  1. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, fuel cannot be in bay 5 or 6, so it must be in bay 1, 2, or 3.
  2. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. As bay 4 holds produce, bay 3 must hold textiles.
  3. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, livestock cannot be in bay 3, so it must be in bay 1 or 2.
  4. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, grain cannot be in bay 1, so it must be in bay 2.
  5. Now only one bay is left for machinery, which is bay 6.

Conclusion:
  Therefore, if bay 4 is holding produce, then the type of cargo for the four bay numbers (1, 2, 3, and 6) that are not bay 4 are completely determined.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
- Bay 1 holds either fuel or textiles.
- Bay 2 holds either fuel or textiles.
- Bay 3 holds either livestock or textiles.
- Bay 4 holds produce.
- Bay 5 holds either grain or livestock.
- Bay 6 holds either grain or machinery.

- If bay 4 holds produce, and the bay textiles is to its left, then bay 3 holds textiles, which means bay 2 and 1 hold fuel and textile in some order.
- Livestock is between textiles and grain.
- Bay 5 holds grain or livestock.
- Bay 6 holds grain or machinery.

Action: Answer("B") 
- If we start from right to left and use the above information, we can determine three bays' cargos with certainty: Bay 6 is not holding livestock, the bay 5 cannot hold produce, and bay 4 holds produce.
- We cannot rule out whether bay 3 holds livestock or textiles by using this information, so we cannot determine whether bays 1 and 2 hold fuel or textile. Therefore, there are three bays where the cargo is not completely determined, so the answer is (B) three.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If bay 4 is holding the produce, then textiles must be in bay 3 or bay 5, and fuel must be in bay 1 or bay 2, but we don't know anything about machinery and grain.
  From the given rules we know that the number of the bays with cargoes follow this order: fuel < produce < textiles < livestock < grain
  Therefore the bay numbers that have machineries, fuel and grain are 1 and 2.
  Textiles can be in bay 3 or bay 5 with produce being in bay 4.
  Livestock is in one of the bays 2 or 3 and grain should be higher than that.
  Hence, grain is in bay 6 and livestock is in bay 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
If bay 4 is holding produce, then:
- Bay 5 is holding textiles
- Bay 3 is holding fuel or machinery
- Bay 6 cannot be holding livestock or grain
We do not know the contents of bay 1 and 2.

Action: Answer("C") 
If bay 4 is holding produce, then the contents of bays 5 and 3 are also determined. The contents of bays 1, 2, and 6 are still undetermined. Thus, the type of cargo for four bays is completely determined.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 4 is holding produce.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  There are exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
Action: Answer("C") 
Bay 4 is holding produce, and from this, we can determine that the bays holding fuel and textiles must be bay 1 and bay 3 (in some order). Additionally, we know the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 6, so it must be bay 5. Finally, we know the bay holding grain is the highest-numbered remaining bay, which is bay 6. Thus, for four of the bays (1, 3, 4, and 5), the type of cargo is completely determined.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We know there are six bays numbered 1 through 6, each with different cargo (fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles).
  We also know the following conditions in the loading dock:
  1. Grain > Livestock
  2. Livestock > Textiles
  3. Produce > Fuel
  4. Textiles is adjacent to Produce.

  If Bay 4 is holding Produce, then we know
  1. Bay 4 holds Produce.
  2. Bay 5 holds Textiles (given that Textiles is adjacent to Produce).
  3. Bay 6 holds Livestock (because Livestock > Textiles)
  4. Bay 3 holds Fuel (because Produce > Fuel)
  Therefore, Bay 1 holds Machinery and Bay 2 holds Grain.

We can see that the type of cargo in bays 1 and 2 are completely determined based on the given information. However, for bays 3, 4, 5, and 6, more than one type of cargo is still possible. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  If bay 4 is holding produce:
    -The bay holding textiles is either 3 or 5.
    -The bay holding livestock is 2 or 1.
    -The bay holding grain must be 1 or 2, depending on the bay holding livestock.
    -The bay holding fuel must be 5 or 6, depending on the bay holding produce.

Going through the possibilities:
- If textiles is at bay 3 (and livestock is at bay 2), then grain must be at bay 1 and fuel must be at bay 6. Thus, bay 5 must hold livestock and bay 4 holds produce. So, in this case, cargo of 4 bays would completely be determined.
- If textiles is at bay 5 (and livestock is at bay 1), then grain must be at bay 2 and fuel must be at bay 5. Thus, bay 4 would be holding produce. So, in this case also cargo of 4 bays would be completely determined.

  B: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. But Ortega and Zayre are selected. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  C: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. But neither Ortega nor Paine are selected. This option is also consistent with the other two conditions, so this option is possible.
  D: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Wong is not selected on this option but is part of the condition that if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  E: This option includes Wong on the team, and it is consistent with Wong's condition. Therefore, this option is possible. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - At least four employees will be selected for the team.
  - If Myers is selected, neither Ortega nor Paine can be selected.
  - If Schmidt is selected, both Paine and Thomson must be selected.
  - If Wong is selected, both Myers and Yoder must be selected.
 
A: Myers and Schmidt are both selected, which means that two of Paine, Thomson and Wong have to be selected. However, selecting Wong would mean that both Myers and Yoder have to be selected, which would make it a team of six members, which is not allowed. Therefore, this option is not possible.
B: This option includes Ortega, which means that Myers should not be on the team, and this option violates the given conditions. Therefore, this option is not possible.
C: This option includes Paine and Yoder, which means that Myers cannot be on the team and this option follows the given conditions. Additionally, Zayre can also be on the team. Therefore, this option is possible.
D: This option includes Schmidt, and as per the given conditions, both Paine and Thomson must be included if Schmidt is selected. Additionally, Yoder and Zayre can also be included. Therefore, this option is possible.
E: This option includes Wong, which means that both Myers and Yoder must be selected, and including Thomson and Zayre would result in a team with more than four members. Therefore, this option is not possible.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 (but not both)
  2. Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2 (but not both)
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  5. More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  6. Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall are 7 sales representatives.
  
Analysis: 
  If more sales reps work in Zone 1 than Zone 3, then at most there could be two sales reps working in Zone 3. 
  If only one sales rep worked in Zone 3 and more sales reps worked in Zone 1, then at least three sales reps would be working in Zone 1, which would violate the condition that there are more sales reps in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, at least two sales reps work in Zone 3 if more sales reps work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  From condition 2, neither Tiao nor Udall can work in both Zone2 and another zone (only one zone). 
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then by condition 2, Udall cannot work in Zone 2. By condition 4, Udall and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, and thus both would have to work in Zone 3 which would mean three sales reps work in Zone 3, not two. This contradicts the information provided in the question.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1 because Tiao cannot work there per condition 1. 
  From condition 3, Quinn must work in Zone 1 with Parra.
  From condition 4, Udall and Stuckey must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  By condition 2, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. 
  Therefore, there must be only one sales rep in Zone 1.
  By condition 5, there must be at least two sales reps in Zone 3.
  
Analysis of the choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2 - Nothing in the information implies that Kim has to work in Zone 2. Out. 
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2 - Nothing in the information implies that Mahr has to work in Zone 2. Out.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3 - From the information provided, both Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone per condition 3. Since Quinn works in Zone 1, and there is at most one sales rep in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3. In. 
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1 - From condition 1, either Parra or Tiao can work in Zone 1 (but not both). Per our analysis, Parra works in Zone 1, so Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Out. 
  E: Udall works in Zone 3 - Udall and Stuckey must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. From the analysis, Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 3. In. 

Action: Answer("CE")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The software company has seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - The sales representatives have to work in 3 different zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
- Option A conflicts with the information given in the question that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, Option A is not possible.
- Option B does not provide information about the sales representatives working in Zone 1 and Zone 3, so we cannot determine whether it is true or not. Therefore, Option B is not the answer.
- Option C conflicts with the information that Parra works in Zone 1. Therefore, Option C is not the answer.
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than Zone 3, then Udall cannot work in Zone 1 because either Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2, while Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall. Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than Zone 3, Udall must work in Zone 3, which makes Option E a valid possibility.
- However, we cannot determine whether Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 based on the information provided, which means we cannot determine whether Option D is true or not.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
To maximize the number of sales representatives in Zone 1 (according to the given information), we can assume that Parra works in Zone 1 (since the only other choice is Tiao, and Tiao can work in Zone 2). This means Tiao works in Zone 2. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, but since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it is safe to assume that they work in Zone 3. Hence, this leaves 3 sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, and Quinn) to work in Zone 1. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Parra works in Zone 1, this means Quinn also works in Zone 1. Therefore, Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 3.

A: Kim works in Zone 2. This cannot be true, because Kim works in Zone 3.
B: Mahr works in Zone 2. This cannot be true, because Mahr works in Zone 3.
C: Parra works in Zone 3. This cannot be true, because it was established earlier that Parra works in Zone 1.
D: Tiao works in Zone 1. This is true based on the given information.
E: Udall works in Zone 3. This is true based on the given information.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs exactly 7 sales representatives to work in its three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Analysis: 
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there can be at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Additionally,
  - If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 1. This would leave Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Quinn to be split between Zones 1 and 3. There would be at least three sales representatives in Zone 1, which would be more than the available slots if there are only two sales representatives in Zone 3. Thus, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  - If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3. This would leave Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Quinn to be split between Zones 1 and 3. There would be at least three sales representatives in Zone 3, which would be more than the available slots if there are only two sales representatives in Zone 1. Thus, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  - If Udall works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Parra must work in Zone 3. This would leave Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Quinn to be split between Zones 1 and 3. The only way for there to be only two sales representatives in Zone 3 is if Kim, Mahr, and Quinn work in Zone 1 and Stuckey works in Zone 3. Thus, Udall could work in Zone 1.
  - If Kim, Mahr, or Quinn works in Zone 2, then both Tiao and Udall would have to work in Zone 3. This would mean that there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts the given information that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Thus, A and B cannot be true.
   
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - They work in 3 different sales zones.
  - Zone 1 either has Parra or Tiao, but not both.
  - Zone 2 either has Tiao or Udall, but not both.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  - There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 can have at most 3 representatives (while Zone 3 can have at most 2 representatives).
  
  A: We do not know whether Kim works in Zone 2 or not.
  B: We do not know whether Mahr works in Zone 2 or not.
  C: If Parra works in Zone 3, then Zone 1 can have at most 2 representatives, which contradicts the given condition that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  D: If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3 (because Parra and Tiao must work in different zones). However, this means Zone 1 can have at most 2 representatives, which contradicts the given condition that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  E: If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well. This means that Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 2, and Tiao must work in Zone 1. In this case, Zone 1 has 3 representatives, Zone 2 has 2 representatives, and Zone 3 has 2 representatives, which satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is E.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Exactly one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales reps work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then we can only have 1 person in Zone 3, 2 people in Zone 2, and 4 people in Zone 1.
  
Elimination:
  - A and B are impossible because Zone 2 can only have 2 people at most and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - C is impossible because we can only have 1 person in Zone 3.
  
Validation:
  - D is possible because exactly one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and we need 4 people in Zone 1 if more reps work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. This means that the other four reps must work in the other two sales zones (i.e., one rep in Zone 3 and two reps in Zone 2).
  - E is also possible because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and we can only have 1 person in Zone 3. Therefore, three reps must work in Zone 1 (which includes Parra or Tiao), and two reps must work in Zone 2 (which includes either Tiao or Udall).
  
Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The company has three sales zones - Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3.
- Exactly 7 sales representatives work in these three sales zones.
- Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 1.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra doesn't work in Zone 1. Similarly, if Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao doesn't work in Zone 1. 

A: Kim's zone is not mentioned in any of the conditions.
B: Mahr's zone is not mentioned in any of the conditions.
C: If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 1. But if Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra doesn't work in Zone 1. This means that Parra cannot work in Zone 3, and hence this option is not possible.
D: If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra doesn't work in Zone 1. But we also know that either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1. This means that Parra must work in Zone 1 if Tiao works in Zone 2. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn also works in Zone 1. Since there are 2 or 3 people in Zone 1, and we already have 2 people in Zone 1 (Parra and Quinn), we can have at most one more person from Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall in Zone 1. If Stuckey works in Zone 1, then Udall works in Zone 3. Otherwise, if Udall works in Zone 1, then Stuckey works in Zone 3. In either case, there are more people in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so this option is not possible.
E: If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey works in Zone 3 as well. This means that either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1, and the other person must work in Zone 2 (since there can be at most one person in Zone 1 from Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall). If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2, and there are 3 people in Zone 3. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 2, and there are 3 people in Zone 3. In both cases, there are more people in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Hence, this option is possible.

Action: Answer('E')
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 cannot be the zone with the smallest number of sales representatives.

Analysis:
- If more representatives work in Zone 1 than Zone 3, then Zone 2 should have the smallest number of representatives.
- We know that either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2 and there are at least two sales representatives in that zone.
- Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because that would leave only one sales representative in Zone 2, which is impossible because Zone 2 has the smallest number of sales representatives.
- Since Udall does not work in Zone 2, based on the rule "Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other", Udall cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra must work in Zone 1.
- Also, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so Quinn must work in Zone 1 with Parra.
- Therefore, the number of sales representatives in Zone 1 (Parra, Quinn, and Tiao/Udall) is greater than the number in Zone 3, which means that we cannot have both Kim and Mahr in Zone 3.
- Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey are in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  - There are exactly 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then:
    * Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 (but not both).
    * Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2 (but not both).
    * Parra and Quinn, and Stuckey and Udall are in the same sales zone.
    * There are more sales representatives in either Zone 1 or Zone 2 than in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("C") - If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra could work in Zone 3.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  * Four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J, on two different days.
  * Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  * Reynaldo cannot test F.
  * Yuki cannot test J.
  * Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  * The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

Since Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus, Reynaldo, and Yuki must test F, H, and G respectively.
On the second day, persons who test F, G, and H on the first day must test H, J, and F respectively. Yuki has H on the first day, so Seamus will have to test H on the first day, which means Theresa can't have H on the second day.
Option A is not possible because Reynaldo has G on the first day. According to the rule on the second day, he must have H which makes this option impossible.
Option B is not possible because Seamus has to test H on day two, as highlighted in the rule.
Option C is not possible because Yuki has H on the first day.
Option D is true because Yuki has to test J on the first day, which implies that Seamus must test J on the second day.
Option E is not possible because Theresa tests J on the first day, which implies that G is not available for her on the second day.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  On the first day of testing, each of the four riders will test one of the four bicycles, F, G, H, and J. 
  On the second day, each of the riders will test a different bicycle from the one they tested on the first day. 
  Reynaldo cannot test F and Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must test H on one of the days. 
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  
Analysis: 
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day (because Yuki cannot test J) and Seamus must test J on the first day (because the bicycle Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day). This means Seamus will not test H on the first day. Theresa must test H on one of the days, but if she tests J on the first day, then she cannot test H on the first day. Reynaldo cannot test F, so he cannot test J on the second day if Theresa tested J on the first day. Therefore, the only option that is possible is that Yuki tests H on the second day.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders will test four bicycles on two different days.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then there are only two possible bicycles that Seamus can test on the first day: F or H.
  
Solutions:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day or second day and Seamus has to test J on the second day. Thus, Seamus has to test F or H on the first day. This leaves us with two possibilities:
    1. If Seamus tests F on the first day, then Reynaldo will have to test G, Yuki will have to test H on the first day, and Theresa will have to test G on the second day. This means that the only bicycle left for Yuki to test on the second day is J, which Seamus will test.
    2. If Seamus tests H on the first day, then Reynaldo will have to test G, Yuki will have to test F on the first day, and Theresa will have to test G on the second day. This means that the only bicycle left for Yuki to test on the second day is J, which Seamus will test.
    
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: Each rider tests only one bicycle per day and all four bicycles are tested each day. Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. If Theresa tests J on day one, then that means that Yuki cannot test J on day one (because all four bicycles are tested each day). Therefore, Yuki must test F or H on day one. If Yuki tests F on day one, then Seamus must test F on day two, which means Reynaldo cannot test F, and he would have to test G instead. If Yuki tests H on day one, then Seamus must test J on day two, which means Reynaldo would have to test G. 
A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. (Could be true if Yuki tests F on the first day.)
B: Seamus tests H on the first day. (Cannot be true because Theresa tests J on day one.)
C: Yuki tests H on the second day. (Cannot be true because Yuki tests H on day one.)
D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. (Could be true. If Yuki tests H on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day.)
E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. (Cannot be true because Reynaldo must test G on the second day if Yuki tests F on the first day.)
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are four riders: Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki
  - There are four bicycles: F, G, H, and J
  - Each rider tests one bicycle on the first day and a different one on the second day
  - All four bicycles are tested each day
  - Reynaldo can't test F, Yuki can't test J, Theresa must test H
  - Yuki's first day bicycle must be tested by Seamus on the second day
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test G. That means Seamus will test J on the first day, and Yuki will test either F or H.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are four riders Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki who will test one of four bicycles F, G, H, J over a two-day period.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must test H.
  Yuki and Seamus test the bicycle tested by each other on the next day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then she won't be able to test H on the second day because both Theresa and Yuki must test H.
  A: Reynaldo cannot test F, so he won't test G.
  B: If Theresa tests J, then Yuki must test H on the first day and Seamus must test H on the second day. So Seamus cannot test H on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests J on the first day and Yuki must test H. So this option could be true.
  D: Yuki tests J on the first day and Seamus tests J on the second day. So Seamus is not testing J on the first day.
  E: Theresa cannot test G on the second day because she must test H.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 4 riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) and 4 bicycles (F, G, H, and J).
  - Each rider tests a different bicycle on Day 1 and a different bicycle on Day 2. Each bicycle is tested both days.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F. 
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - Yuki tests a bicycle on Day 1 that Seamus tests on Day 2. So, if Yuki tests a bicycle on day 1, then Seamus will not test that same bicycle on day 1. 

Action: Answer("D")
If Theresa tests J on the first day, then:
- Reynaldo cannot test F (given)
- Yuki cannot test J (given)
- Theresa tests J (given)
- So Seamus must test H on day 1. (Theresa cannot test H since she is testing J)
- On day 2, Reynaldo cannot test G because he cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test F. Then, Yuki must test G and Seamus must test J.
So, it is possible that Seamus is one of the testers for J. Therefore, the correct choice is D.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Four riders, Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa and Yuki, and four bicycles, F, G, H, and J.
  Each rider will test only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then H must be tested by either Reynaldo or Seamus on the first day.
  
A: It cannot be true for Reynaldo to test G on the second day because each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles have to be tested each day. Reynaldo's first assignment is one of the remaining two bicycles (G or H) after Theresa has chosen J. Therefore, Reynaldo must test H on the second day.
B: Seamus needs to test the bike that Yuki tests on the first day, and Yuki cannot test J, so Seamus cannot test H on the first day if Theresa tests J on the first day. Therefore, B is not true.
C: Yuki cannot test H on the second day because Theresa must test H either on the first day or the second day. Therefore, C is not true.
D: Seamus needs to test the bike that Yuki tests on the first day. If Theresa tests J on the first day, and Theresa must test H either on the first day or the second day. Therefore, Seamus can only test H on the second day. So D is not true.
E: Since Theresa must test H either on the first day or the second day, she cannot test G. Therefore E is not true.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  4. Yuki tests on day 1, then Seamus tests that bicycle on day 2.
  5. Each bicycle is tested by two different riders.
  6. Theresa tests J on the first day.

Analysis:
  Based on 5. and 6., we know that Theresa cannot test J on the second day, and since each bicycle is tested twice, J must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  Based on 3., we know that Theresa must test H on either the first or the second day.
  Based on 2., we know that Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
  Based on 4., we know that Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day, which means that Seamus tests either F, G, or H on the second day.

A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
   We don't know with certainty which bicycle Reynaldo will test, but he cannot test F, which is the only bicycle left for him to test on the second day if he tests G on the first day. Therefore, this option is not possible.
   
B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
   Seamus must test the bicycle Yuki tested on day 1, which means Seamus will test either F, G, or H. We know Theresa will test J on the first day, so she cannot also test H on the first day. If Seamus tests H on the first day, then Yuki must test either F or G on the first day. This is possible because Yuki is not restricted from testing F or G on the first day. Therefore, this option is possible.

C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
   We don't know which bicycle Yuki tested on the first day. This option is possible but not necessarily true.

D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
   This statement is true based on the analysis and the conditions given in the problem. Therefore, this option is possible.
   
E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
   Theresa cannot test G on the first day because Theresa tests J on the first day. On the second day, Theresa must test H, which is the only bicycle left for her to test. Therefore, this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will test four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) over two days. Each rider will test one bike per day and all bikes will be tested each day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - On day one, Yuki's bike must be tested by Seamus on day two.
  
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then:
  - Yuki must test a bike other than J on the first day
  - Seamus must test the J bike on the first day
  - Reynaldo must test one of the bikes other than F on the first day
  
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. - We don't know which bike Reynaldo will test on day two but it cannot be F. So, this choice could be true. 
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day. - Seamus has to test J on the first day. So, this choice cannot be true.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day. - We don't know which bike Yuki will test on day two. So, this choice could be true.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. - Seamus must test J on the first day. So, this choice is true.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. - Theresa cannot test G because she must test H. So, this choice cannot be true.

Logic: 
  - If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the reports must be given by the remaining 6 students: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  - We know that George cannot give a morning report since he will give a report on Tuesday. The reports on Monday morning must therefore be given by George's remaining colleagues: Helen, Irving, Kyle, Nina, Olivia, or Robert.
  - Similarly, we know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so the afternoon reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday must be given by any of the remaining 6 students.
  - Given that George has to give a report on Tuesday, there is only one possible pair of students that can give reports on Tuesday: Helen and Irving. 
  - If Nina gives her report on Monday or Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports the next day; if not then they can choose not to present.
  - The remaining students (Kyle, Lenore, and the two students who will not present reports) can give reports in any remaining slots.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- The reports will be given by exactly 6 people over 3 days, with exactly 2 reports given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- George can only give his report on Tuesday.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
- If Nina gives a report, then the next day (after Nina's report) Helen and Irving must both give reports unless it's Wednesday.
- If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only 6 students left: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
- If Nina's report is on Monday, then neither Helen nor Irving will give their reports on Tuesday (by condition above).
- If Nina's report is on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving will have to give their reports on Wednesday. 
- If Nina's report is on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give their reports on either Monday or Tuesday. 

Analysis: 
- If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only 6 people left who can give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
- Since George can only give his report on Tuesday, then he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
- Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, then they must both give morning reports, and this means that George must give an afternoon report so that there are still two reports left to give on Tuesday.
- If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday or Wednesday. This means that either George, Helen, or Irving can give a morning report on Monday, and the remaining two will give morning reports on Tuesday or Wednesday (depending on when Nina's report is given). 
- If Nina's report is given on Monday, then neither Helen nor Irving can give their reports on Tuesday, which means that they must both give reports on Wednesday, and George must give his morning report on Tuesday.
- If Nina's report is on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving will have to give their reports on Wednesday, and George can give his morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
- If Nina's report is on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give their morning reports on either Monday or Tuesday, and George can give his morning report on the remaining day. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The reports will be given over three consecutive days-Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
  Exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports - unless Nina’s report is given on Wednesday.
  Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  
We need to determine which students can give oral reports on Monday morning, Tuesday morning, and Wednesday morning.

On Monday morning, two students must give oral reports.
We can eliminate choices C and D because both of them contain Olivia or Robert as possible choices. 
From the remaining choices, A and E, the only student whose schedule is fixed is George, who must give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, it is helpful to start with choice E to determine if there is a valid schedule:
- Monday morning: Robert, George
- Monday afternoon: Nina, Helen
- Tuesday morning: Irving, Olivia
- Tuesday afternoon: George, (either Helen and Irving or Nina)
- Wednesday morning: Kyle, Lenore, (either Helen and Irving or Nina)

This schedule does not work because Kyle and Lenore cannot give reports. Thus, we can eliminate choice E.

Now, we must check if choice A is valid:
- Monday morning: George, Helen
- Monday afternoon: Irving, Olivia
- Tuesday morning: Nina, Robert
- Tuesday afternoon: George, (either Helen and Irving or Nina)
- Wednesday morning: Olivia, Irving

This schedule satisfies all of the given conditions and meets the constraints of the problem. Thus, the answer is A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The seminar has eight students who will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days – Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Two reports will be given each day – one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
 
Solution:
  From the conditions given, we know that George must give a report on Tuesday, and both Olivia and Robert can't give afternoon reports. Therefore, we can deduce that:
  - Monday morning report must be given by either Nina, Kyle or Lenore.
  - Tuesday morning report must be given by either Helen, Kyle or Lenore.
  - Wednesday morning report must be given by either Kyle or Lenore.
  Again from the conditions given, if Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, we can make the following scenarios:

  Scenario 1: Nina gives a report on Monday morning. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be given by:
   - Monday: Nina & Kyle/Lenore
   - Tuesday: George & Helen/Kyle/Lenore
   - Wednesday: Kyle/Lenore & Irving/Helen
   
  Scenario 2: Nina gives a report on Wednesday morning. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be given by:
   - Monday: Kyle/Lenore & Nina
   - Tuesday: George & Helen/Kyle/Lenore
   - Wednesday: Nina & Irving/Helen
   
  Since Kyle and Lenore don't give reports, the only possible scenario is Scenario 2. Hence, Answer("C"): Nina, Helen, and Olivia could give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Total of 6 individual oral reports.
  2. George reports on Tuesday only.
  3. Olivia & Robert can't give afternoon report.
  4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday
  5. Kyle and Lenore don't give reports.
  
Process:
  - Since Kyle and Lenore didn't give reports, then the two reports on Monday must be given by George and Nina.
  - Thus, the reports on Tuesday must be given by Helen and Irving (based on condition 4).
  - And the reports on Wednesday must be given by Olivia and Robert.
Action: Answer("B")  Irving, Robert, and Helen would give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- From the rule "(E) If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday", if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day.
- From the rule "Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report" and the fact that six students give reports during three days and each day has only two reports, we know that George must give a report on Tuesday morning.
- From the rule "Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report", on each day, either Olivia or Robert can give a morning report, but not both.
- Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.

We can start by eliminating choices that are impossible:
- Option A: Helen, George, and Nina cannot give all three morning reports because there are only two reports each morning.
- Option D: Olivia cannot give a morning report on Monday or Tuesday since she cannot give an afternoon report. So, she can only give a morning report on Wednesday. Robert cannot give a morning report on Wednesday because only one morning report remains and Helen must give it with Irving. Therefore, this option is not possible.

We could also apply the condition "If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday" and see which option(s) satisfy it:
- Option B:
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. The only possible combination is Helen on Tuesday morning and Irving on Tuesday afternoon.
  - On Wednesday, Robert and Olivia cannot give morning reports. George cannot give a morning report on Wednesday because he must give it on Tuesday. Therefore, the remaining students are Helen, Irving, and Nina. Since Nina gave a report on Monday, she cannot give another report on Wednesday. Therefore, Helen and Irving must give the two morning reports on Wednesday.
- Option C:
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. The only possible combination is Helen on Tuesday morning and Irving on Tuesday afternoon.
  - On Wednesday, Robert and Olivia cannot give a morning report. George cannot give a morning report on Wednesday because he must give it on Tuesday. The only remaining choice is for Nina to give the Wednesday morning report. Therefore, this option is not possible.
- Option E:
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. The only possible combination is Helen on Tuesday morning and Irving on Tuesday afternoon.
  - On Wednesday, Robert and Olivia cannot give a morning report. Nina cannot give a morning report on Wednesday because she must give it on Monday if she gives a report. Therefore, the remaining students are George, Helen, and Robert. So, George and Helen must give the two morning reports on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 students, exactly 6 give reports over 3 consecutive days (2 reports/day)
  - Tuesday: George gives a report
  - Olivia & Robert cannot give afternoon reports
  - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  - If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only 6 students remaining.
  
Working through the choices with the given constraints:
  A: If Helen, George, and Nina give Monday's morning reports, then Irving and Kyle must give Monday's afternoon reports and Olivia must give Tuesday's morning report. Since George is giving a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Wednesday. This leaves only Lenore and Robert available for the Wednesday morning report. However, we know that Lenore is not giving a report, leaving Robert as the only possible choice, which violates the constraint that neither Olivia nor Robert can give afternoon presentations. Therefore, A is not possible.
  B: If Irving, Robert, and Helen give the morning reports on Monday, then Kyle and Nina must give Monday afternoon reports and Olivia must give Tuesday's morning report. Since George is giving a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Wednesday. If neither Helen nor Irving gives a report on Wednesday morning, then the remaining person must give it, which is either Olivia or Robert, violating the constraint that neither may give afternoon reports. Therefore, either Helen or Irving must give the Wednesday morning report. This satisfies all of the given conditions, thus B is possible.
  C: If Nina, Helen, and Olivia give the morning reports on Monday, then George and Irving must give Monday afternoon reports and Kyle must give Tuesday's morning report. Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon presentations, then Lenore must give Tuesday's afternoon presentation. On Wednesday morning, only Robert is left, but that would violate the constraint that neither Olivia nor Robert can give afternoon presentations. Therefore, C is not possible.
  D: If Olivia, Robert, and Irving give the morning reports on Monday, then Kyle and George must give Monday afternoon reports and Nina must give Tuesday's morning report. Since George is giving a report on Tuesday morning, neither Helen nor Irving can give the Wednesday morning report. That leaves only Helen or Robert, but that violates the constraint that neither Olivia nor Robert can give afternoon reports. Therefore, D is not possible.
  E: If Robert, George, and Helen give the morning reports on Monday, then Irving and Kyle must give Monday afternoon reports. Since George is giving a report on Tuesday morning, neither Helen nor Irving can give the Wednesday morning report. That leaves only Robert or Olivia, but that violates the constraint that neither Olivia nor Robert can give afternoon presentations. Therefore, E is not possible.

Final Answer: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The seminar consists of 8 students who give reports for 3 days, 2 reports per day.
- George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- Olivia and Robert cannot report in the afternoon.
- If Nina reports, on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, except if Nina's report is on Wednesday.

Action: Answer("C")  
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are 6 students remaining, meaning that we need to assign 3 students to the morning slot for each of the three days. From the conditions given, it follows that George can report only on Tuesday. If Nina does not report, there is no conflict, so Nina does not have to report. If Nina does report, then on the next day (Wednesday), Helen and Irving are required to report (both in the morning). Therefore, if Nina does report, then only Olivia, Robert, and Lenore are left for Monday's morning slot. Thus, the students who could give the morning reports are Nina, Helen, and Olivia, corresponding to choice (C).
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find out the sequence of students who give morning presentations on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Tuesday is the only day that George can give a report.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  We also know that exactly two presentations are given each day- one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Kyle and Lenore do not give any reports.
  
Processing:
We can make the following charts to help us visualize the solution. We can mark morning(M) and afternoon(A) against the names of the students to fill the table. Since we are given that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we can mark "X" against their names. The other conditions can be recorded as empty spaces.

<table>
<tr><th>Monday</th><th>Tuesday</th><th>Wednesday</th></tr>
<tr><td>M - x</td><td>A - G  </td><td>A - O, R</td></tr>
<tr><td>A - x</td><td>M - G  </td><td>M - O, R</td></tr>
<tr><td></td>   <td>A - x  </td><td>A - N, (H, I)</td></tr>
<tr><td></td>   <td></td><td>M/N - (H, I) </td></tr>
</table>


Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are eight students in the seminar.
  There are six individual oral presentations, two on each day(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday).
  George is only available to give the report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then on the next day both Helen and Irving must give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports "on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively" could be given by:
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  From the given information, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday. 
  If Kyle and Lenore don't give reports, then that leaves eight students with 4 reports to give for Monday and Wednesday
  From the options, Helen, Irving and Robert are the only students that do not conflict with this requirement and that haven't been assigned a specific day or time.
  Therefore, the order in which the reports could be given would be:
  Monday: Helen and Irving (morning), Nina and George(afternoon)
  Tuesday: Robert and Olivia (morning), Nina and George(afternoon)
  Wednesday: Helen and Irving(morning), Olivia (afternoon)
  Which satisfies the given conditions.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
- There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
- At least two books are on each shelf.
- More books are on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
- I is on the middle shelf.
- K is on a higher shelf than F.
- O is on a higher shelf than L.
- F is on the same shelf as M.

Reasoning:
- If we know that I is on the middle shelf, we know that F and M are not on the middle shelf.
- If F is on the same shelf as M, and neither of them are on the middle shelf (since I is on the middle shelf), then they must be on the top or bottom shelves together.
- If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K and F cannot be on the same shelf. That means F and M must be on the same shelf together on either top or bottom shelf.
- More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so F and M are on the bottom shelf together. That means L and O are on the top shelf together, since O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- G, H, and K are on the middle shelf. So we know that G and K are on the same shelf as each other.

Action: Answer(B)
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The puzzle involves eight books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and three shelves.
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  
  A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, we know that F must be placed on a lower (i.e., different) shelf than I and M. However, we do not know where any of the other books go, so this statement does not fully determine the placement of all the books.
  B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we do not know where any of the other books go, so this statement does not fully determine the placement of all the books.
  C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be placed on a different shelf than L and F. However, we do not know where any of the other books go, so this statement does not fully determine the placement of all the books.
  D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must be placed on the lower shelf than M and H. We also know that I must be placed on the middle shelf. From there, we know that K must be placed on the top shelf, and that O and L must be placed on the bottom shelf (since O is higher than L). Therefore, the placement of all the books is fully determined by this statement.
  E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we know that L must be placed on a lower (i.e., different) shelf than H and O. However, we do not know where any of the other books go, so this statement does not fully determine the placement of all the books.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We know there are 3 shelves and 8 books on them.
  We know that at least two books are placed on each shelf, so we have 2-3-3 distribution of books on each shelf, or 2-2-4 distribution.
  With "More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf." we know that the distribution is 2-3-3.
  With "I is placed on the middle shelf." we know where I is placed, middle shelf.
  With "K is placed on a higher shelf than F." we know K is either on the top shelf, or middle shelf.
  With "O is placed on a higher shelf than L." we know O is either on the top shelf, or middle shelf.
  With "F is placed on the same shelf as M." we know F is on the same shelf as M, and from previous observation, we know that K or O must be on another shelf than F and M.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: If I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, then we know that F, K, and O must either be placed on different shelves separate from I and M or be placed on the same shelf as each other. From option A, F and M are placed on the same shelf, so we can determine where each of the remaining 6 books go: K is placed on the top shelf, O is placed on the middle shelf, G is placed on the top shelf, and H and L are placed on the bottom shelf.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  There are eight books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  There are three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  More books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  If I is placed on the middle shelf, then F and M must also be placed on the shelf because of F's placement with M.
  If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K must be placed on the top shelf and F must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the bottom or middle shelf.

Solution:
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then F must also be placed on that shelf. This would determine the placement of all three books.
  Therefore, the answer is (D) M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 4:
Knowledge: The question provides a set of conditions that determine the placement of the eight books in the bookcase. The answer should be the condition that allows the placement of the books on the shelves to be fully determined.

A: The placement of book I and book M alone does not provide enough information to fully determine the placement of all 8 books.

B: The placement of book K and book G alone does not provide enough information to fully determine the placement of all 8 books.

C: F and L both need to be on the same shelf according to the condition stated in the problem. However, this is not enough information to fully determine the placement of all 8 books.

D: The placement of book M and book H does not provide enough information to fully determine the placement of all 8 books.

E: Book O is placed higher than book L. Books on the bottom shelf are more than the books on the top shelf. This means book O must be on the bottom shelf while book L must be on the middle shelf. This also means book F must be on the same shelf as book M on the top shelf. This leaves book G to be on the same shelf as book K, which must be the bottom shelf because book O must be on the bottom shelf. The last book is book H which can be placed either on the middle or the top shelf since we just have two or fewer books on these two shelves. Therefore, the placement of all 8 books can be fully determined by the placement of book H and book O which is given in this condition.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are eight books to be placed on three shelves.
  - The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  - I is placed in the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
A: If I and M are in the same shelf, then we know that F is in the remaining shelf with L and O. Also, K and G have to be in the remaining shelf. However, we can't determine which of the remaining shelves will be used for which group, so the answer can't be A.

B: If K and G are in the same shelf, then we know that I and F/M/L/O will be divided into the remaining two shelves. But we can't determine which group will be on which shelf, so the answer can't be B.

C: If F and L are in the same shelf, then we know that O and M/I will be in the remaining shelf. In that case, K would be with F/L and G would be with O/M/I, thus we get a unique solution. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- At least two books are placed on each shelf.
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- Conditions: 
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
A: If I and M were on the same shelf, that would still leave options for where the other books should go, as none of the conditions are related to either I or M being placed together.
B: If K and G were on the same shelf, that would still leave options for where the other books should go, as none of the conditions are related to either K or G being placed together.
C: If L and F were on the same shelf, that would still leave options for where the other books should go, as none of the conditions are related to either L or F being placed together.
D: If M and H were on the same shelf, this would force F to be on the top shelf, K on the middle shelf, I on the bottom shelf, and O and G on the middle or bottom shelves. The condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L is not met, so this option cannot be correct.
E: If H and O were on the same shelf, this would force F to be on the top shelf, K on the middle shelf, I on the bottom shelf, and L and G on the middle or bottom shelves. The condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L is not met, so this option cannot be correct.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The bookcase has exactly three shelves and eight books - F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O - with at least two books placed on each shelf.
  More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is on the middle shelf.
  K is on a higher shelf than F.
  O is on a higher shelf than L.
  F and M are on the same shelf.

Solution:
  If I is on the middle shelf, that leaves four books - F, G, H, and L - for the top and bottom shelves, but F cannot be on the top shelf since K is higher.
  If F and M are on the same shelf, that means the four remaining books will go to the other two shelves. But since there are more books on the bottom shelf, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. That leaves K and O on the top shelf, leaving H and G for the middle shelf.
  Thus, knowing that F and M are on the same shelf fully determines which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The bookcase has 3 shelves and 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  At least 2 books are on each shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Solution:
  If I is placed on the middle shelf, the top shelf is already determined since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Also, F is on the same shelf as M, so F and M are already determined. We just have to determine which shelf K, L, G, and H belong to.
  
  A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, that does not determine which shelves F, G, H, K, and L belong to.
  B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, that does not determine which shelves F, H, I, L, and O belong to.
  C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, that does not determine which shelves G, H, I, K, and O belong to.
  D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we still do not know which shelf F, G, I, K, L, and O is placed on.
  E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we can determine that O and L are on the bottom shelf, and that H, F, and M are placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, K and G must be placed on the top shelf.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - There are exactly three shelves.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

A: If I and M are on the same shelf, then F must be on the remaining shelf. However, we do not know which shelf that is, and we do not know where to place the other books. Thus, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if this statement is true.

B: If K and G are on the same shelf, then we know that shelf must be the top or middle one, since K is not on the bottom shelf. However, we do not know where to place the other books. Thus, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if this statement is true.

C: If L and F are on the same shelf, then we know that shelf must be the bottom one, since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top one. If F is on the bottom with L, then M must be on the middle shelf with I. That means K and O must be on the top shelf. Since there is only one possible configuration that satisfies all the given conditions, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if this statement is true.

D: If M and H are on the same shelf, then we know that shelf must be the middle one with I. That means F must be on the bottom shelf, and there is no way to determine where O, K, L, and G should go. Thus, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if this statement is true.

E: If H and O are on the same shelf, then we know that shelf must be the top or middle one, since O is not on the bottom shelf. However, there is no way to determine where the other books should go. Thus, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if this statement is true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.
  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The hearing takes exactly three days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
- There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
- Each witness testifies on one day.
- Franco testifies on a day different from Garcia.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong testifies on a day that is not Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.

A: Franco could testify on a day other than Monday, but at least one witness needs to go on Monday.
B: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco cannot go on Wednesday because each witness should testify one day only.
C: Hong should not testify on Monday, so if Garcia and Hong are both scheduled on Tuesday, this could be valid.
D: If Franco and Hong testify on Wednesday, then this is not possible. One of them must be scheduled on Tuesday, so this choice CANNOT be true.
E: This is valid because two witnesses must testify on Tuesday, which could be Jackson and another witness, and at least one witness should testify on Monday, which could be anyone except Iturbe.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses who will testify on three days only—in total.
  Iturbe has to testify on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  Hong cannot testify on Monday.

A: If Franco were the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, and two witnesses have to testify on Tuesday, then there would be two witnesses left to testify on Wednesday; but Iturbe has to testify on Wednesday, so this cannot be true.

B: Iturbe has to testify on Wednesday, and Iturbe and Franco cannot testify on the same day; therefore, this cannot be true.

C: Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco; Hong cannot testify on Monday; and only two witnesses can testify on Tuesday: therefore, this cannot be true.

D: If Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday, then one witness has to testify on Monday, two witnesses have to testify on Tuesday, and only one witness will be left for Wednesday–which would violate the condition that Iturbe must testify on Wednesday.

E: One witness has to testify on Monday, two witnesses have to testify on Tuesday, and only two witnesses will be left for Wednesday—so Jackson could be one of them.  This can be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing takes exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on one day only.
  Franco ≠ Garcia.
  Iturbe 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑒𝑠 on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  Hong ≠ Monday.
  At least one witness 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑒𝑠 on Monday.

A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
- This can be true since at least one witness testifies on Monday.

B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.
- This cannot be true as Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, which is a different day from the day Franco testifies.

C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
- This can be true since exactly two witnesses should testify on Tuesday.

D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
- This can be true since at least one witness should testify on Monday and Hong should testify on Wednesday.

E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
- This cannot be true since exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. So, if Garcia testifies on Monday, Franco will testify on either Tuesday or Wednesday. If Garcia testifies on Tuesday, Franco must testify on Wednesday.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. So, if Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, the other two witnesses who testify on Tuesday are either Garcia and Hong, or Garcia and Jackson, or Hong and Jackson.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday. So, there are either one, two, or three witnesses that testify on Monday.
Analysis:
  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. - This can happen.
  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe. - This cannot happen since Franco does not testify on Wednesday.
  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday. - This can happen.
  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday. - This can happen.
  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday. - This can happen since there are either one, two, or three witnesses that testify on Monday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing takes exactly three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing.
  Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.

A: Franco testifies on a day other than Monday or Tuesday. Thus, Franco cannot be the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. A cannot be true.
B: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and Franco does not testify on Wednesday. Thus, Franco cannot be scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe. B cannot be true.
C: Only two witnesses will testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Garcia and Hong cannot both testify on Tuesday. Therefore, C cannot be true.
D: There are only three days, so both Franco and Hong must testify on the same day. If Garcia testifies on Monday alone, that leaves only Tuesday and Wednesday for the others. This precludes Hong from testifying on Wednesday (because Franco will testify then) and forces Hong to testify on Monday with Garcia, thus making D true.
E: If Jackson testifies on Tuesday, then exactly two of the others also testify on Tuesday, leaving exactly two to testify on Monday. E can be true if Jackson is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Monday.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: There are 5 witnesses to be scheduled in a three-day hearing that takes place on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Franco doesn't testify on the same day as Garcia. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong doesn't testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday. Using a process of elimination, we can determine which answer choice cannot be true based on the given conditions.

Elimination:
A: This could be true, as long as at least one more witness testifies on Monday.
B: This cannot be true, as Iturbe is scheduled to testify on Wednesday and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Iturbe.
C: This can be true, since Garcia and Hong don't have any scheduling restrictions between themselves.
D: This can be true, as long as at least two other witnesses testify on Tuesday, and Jackson testifies on Wednesday.
E: This can be true, since the minimum requirement is for one witness to testify on Monday, and at least two witnesses testify on Tuesday.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are five witnesses--Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  The hearing is exactly three days--Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday--and each witness testifies on exactly one day.
  Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Monday, so this statement can be true.
B: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco and Iturbe will not testify on the same day. Statement B cannot be true. 
C: The two witnesses who testify on Tuesday are not identified, so Garcia and Hong could potentially both be scheduled to testify on Tuesday. This statement can be true.
D: Garcia cannot testify on Monday because Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. Hong does not testify on Monday, so Garcia is not the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. Franco, Hong, Iturbe, or Jackson will also testify on Monday. Statement D cannot be true.
E: Two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday, so this statement can be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  - The hearing is three days long: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
  - Each witness testifies on exactly one day.
  - Franco doesn't testify on the same day as Garcia.
  - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  - Hong doesn't testify on Monday.
  - At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  
A: Franco only testifies once during the hearing, so if he does so on Monday, there will be at least one day without his testimony. Thus, A cannot be true. 
B: Iturbe testifies only on Wednesday. Therefore Franco cannot testify on the same day as Iturbe. Thus, B cannot be true.
C: As Hong does not testify on Monday she must testify either on Tuesday or Wednesday but not on both days so both Garcia and Hong cannot testify on Tuesday together. Thus, C cannot be true.
D: Since at least one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday, Garcia cannot be the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. Thus, D cannot be true. 
E: We know that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, but we don't know which witnesses testify on that day. Thus, it is possible that one of the two witnesses could be Jackson. Therefore, E could be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are five witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson.
  They testify on three different days of one week: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.

Elimination:
  (A) Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday: This can be true, so this is not the answer. 
  (B) Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe: This contradicts the given information, so this could not be true. 
  (C) Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday: This contradicts the given information, so this could not be true.
  (D) Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday: This is possible based on the given information, so this is not the answer.
  (E) Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday, and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday: Jackson testifies on Tuesday with one other witness, so this could not be true. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.

A) It is possible for Franco to testify on Monday as long as there is at least one other witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
B) Iturbe must testify on Wednesday.
C) Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
D) If Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, then Hong cannot be one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday as stated.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must test H.
  - Seamus tests the bicycle that Yuki tested on day 1.
  - Each rider tests a different bicycle on day 2.
  - Theresa tests G on the second day.
  
Working through the answer choices:
  - If Reynaldo tests H on the first day, that would mean he tests J on the second day, which would break the condition that Yuki cannot test J. So, A is not possible.
  - If Reynaldo tests J on the first day, that would mean he tests H on the second day, which could work, but it's not required. So, B is not a necessary conclusion.
  - If Theresa tests H on the second day, that could work, but it's not a necessary conclusion. So, C is not a required conclusion.
  - If Theresa tests J on the first day, that would mean she tests H on the second day, which could work, but it's not required. So, D is not a necessary conclusion.
  - If Yuki tests H on the second day, that would mean Seamus would have to test H on the first day, which would break the condition that Theresa must test H, and it would also mean that Yuki tests a different bicycle on day 2 than on day 1, which is not allowed. So, E is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The riders Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki will test bicycles F, G, H, and J over two days.
  Each rider will test a different bike on each day and each bike will be tested by a different rider on each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F and Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must test H either on the first or second day.
  If Yuki tests a bike on day 1, Seamus must test that same bike on day 2.
  
Analysis:
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, it means that she must have tested H on the first day because she is the only one who must test H. The only riders left to test F and J are Reynaldo and Yuki, but Yuki cannot test J so he must test F. Finally, Seamus must test the bike that Yuki tested on the first day which is F.
  
Actions: 
  From the analysis, Reynaldo will test J on the first day. Therefore, Answer("B") Reynaldo tests J on the first day must be true.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) are each assigned to test one of four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) on each day.
  Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F. 
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H. 
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  
Analysis: 
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then we know that she must test H on the first day. This is because Theresa must be one of the testers for H, and Reynaldo cannot test F. We also know that Seamus must test the bike that Yuki tests on the first day, so if Yuki tests J on the first day, then Seamus will test J on the second day. This means that Reynaldo will test F on the first day.  
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Reynaldo cannot test F.
  2. Yuki cannot test J.
  3. Theresa must test H.
  4. Yuki's Day 1 = Seamus's Day 2.
  5. There are only four bicycles, and each rider can only test one bicycle per day. 

To satisfy all conditions:
  Day 1: Reynaldo (not F), Seamus, Theresa (must be H), Yuki (not J)
  Day 2: Reynaldo, Seamus (Yuki's day 1), Theresa (not G), Yuki

If Theresa tests G on the second day, that means she tested H on the first day, and the possible Day 1 assignments for Reynaldo, Seamus, and Yuki are limited:
  Reynaldo (not F), Seamus(Yuki's Day 1), Theresa (H), Yuki (not J)
  The only choice that satisfies this is B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) will each test one of four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) on the first day, and each will test a different one of the bicycles on the second day.
  - All four bicycles are tested on each day, and each rider only tests one bicycle per day.
  - Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she must not test G on the first day.
  
Process of elimination:
- (A) Reynaldo cannot test F, and H is assigned to Theresa. Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test H on the first day.
- (B) Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki cannot test J. Therefore, there is only one bicycle (G or H) available for Reynaldo on the first day. If Reynaldo tests J, then there is no bicycle available for Yuki on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test G on the first day if Yuki tests J on the first day. If Reynaldo tests G on the first day, and Theresa tests G on the second day, then Seamus must test H on the second day, violating the conditions. Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test J on the first day.
- (C) Theresa already tested H on the first day. Therefore, she cannot test H again on the second day.
- (D) Reynaldo cannot test F, and Theresa tests G on the second day. Therefore, there is only one bicycle (J or H) available for Reynaldo on the first day. If Reynaldo tests J on the first day, then there is no bicycle available for Yuki on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test H on the first day if Yuki tests J on the first day. Then Reynaldo can't test J on the first day. Therefore, Theresa can't test J on the first day.
- (E) Yuki cannot test J, and Theresa tests G on the second day. Therefore, Yuki must test J on the second day, and Seamus must test G on the first day. Therefore, Yuki cannot test H on the second day.
 
The only remaining possible option is (B).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Reynaldo cannot test F.
  - Yuki cannot test J.
  - Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  - Each rider will test a different bicycle on the second day.
  - If Theresa tests G on the second day, then H will not be tested by Theresa on the second day.
  
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day - This could be possible, but there is no connection between Theresa's choice on the second day and Reynaldo's choice on the first day. So, this doesn't have to be true.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day - This doesn't seem possible as Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day - Theresa must test H, and since H is not tested by Theresa on the first day according to the earlier deduction, it must be tested by someone else on the first day and be available for Theresa to test on the second day. So, this could be true.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day. - This doesn't seem possible as Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day - This doesn't seem possible because the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day needs to be tested by Seamus on the second day according to the rule.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
To allocate the riders to the bicycles, the information indicates these conditions:
- Reynaldo ≠ F.
- Yuki ≠ J.
- Theresa needs to test H on any of the two days.
- The bicycle tested by Yuki on the first day will be tested by Seamus on the second day.
- Each person tests a different bicycle each day, and all four bicycles are tested each day.
The goal is to use this information and logic to determine which choice must be true in the given scenario.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then on the first day, one of Reynaldo or Seamus must test H. This is because Theresa cannot test H on the first day, and there needs to be a tester for H on each day.

Furthermore, if Reynaldo is the one testing H on the first day, this means that Yuki would be testing J. However, Seamus needs to test the bike tested by Yuki on the first day, which is J. This would lead to a conflict since Yuki cannot test J. Thus, Reynaldo cannot be testing H on the first day, and it follows that Reynaldo must be testing J on the first day.

Knowledge summarized:
- Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
- Theresa tests G on the second day.
- Seamus must be the one testing H on the first day since nobody else is left.
- Yuki cannot test H on the second day, and she already tested F, so she tests J on the second day.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The first day will have testers Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki on bicycles F, G, H, and J. These same four cyclists will then test bicycles F, G, H, and J on the second day. Reynaldo cannot test bike F and Yuki cannot test bike J, therefore, Seamus must test bicycle J on the second day. Also, Theresa must test bicycle H.
  
Analysis:
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then that means G was not tested by Theresa on the first day. So, if Theresa tests bicycle H on the second day, then H must be the bicycle she tested on the first day, meaning that Reynaldo could not have tested bicycle H on the first day. Thus, Reynaldo tests bicycle J on the first day, and Yuki tests bicycle F on the first day.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Four riders, Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki, will each test one of four bicycles, F, G, H, and J.
- Each rider will test a different bicycle on day 2 than he or she did on day 1. Each bike will be tested each day.
- Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must test H on one of the days. Yuki and Seamus will test the same bicycle on two different days.
- If Theresa tests G on day 2, she didn't test G the first day.
- If Yuki tests G on the first day, then Seamus will test G on the second day.

Action: Answer("B")  
If Theresa tests G on the second day, then she must test H on the first day. The only rider not yet assigned a bicycle to try is Reynaldo. Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test J. Therefore, "Reynaldo tests J on the first day" must be true. So, the answer is B.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The four riders (Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki) each ride one of four bicycles (F, G, H, and J) on each day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine. 
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki test on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

If Theresa tests G on the second day, then the following order of riders testing bikes on each day would satisfy the given conditions:
First Day:
  * Yuki rides F (since they cannot ride J, the only remaining bike)
  * Theresa rides H (since she cannot ride G)
  * Reynaldo rides J (since he cannot ride F)
  * Seamus rides G (since he is the only remaining rider)

Second Day:
  * Reynaldo rides H (since H is the remaining bike he is allowed to ride)
  * Seamus rides F (since he rode G on the first day and Yuki rode F)
  * Yuki rides J (since she rode F on the first day and Theresa rode H)
  * Theresa rides G (since it is the remaining bike)

Then, if Theresa tests G on the second day, it must be true that Reynaldo tests J on the first day.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The articles can be divided into three groups of two (G and J; Q and R; H and S) and one single article (Y).
- S must be before Y. 
- G, J, Q, R, and S must not appear consecutively.
- G must appear before R, and J must appear before G.
- Therefore, the order must be one of the following: "JGQRHSY", "JGSRQHY", "QJGRHSY", or "QJSGRHY".
- The order can be determined from knowing which articles come in the middle.

Action: Answer("D") 
Determining R's location fully determines the order, since if R is the seventh article, then we know that S must appear earlier than Q (as S can't be last and Q can't be third), and this limits the remaining possibilities to either "JGSRQHY" or "QJSGRHY".
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - 3 articles (G, H, and J) cover finance.
  - 3 articles (Q, R, and S) cover nutrition.
  - 1 article (Y) covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
Let's try to eliminate options:

Option A: Doesn't help. We need to know where Q and S are in the sequence in relation to Y.

Option B: Still not enough information. We don't know where Q and S are. 

Option C: We only know that R is fourth. We still don't know where Q, S, or Y are.

Option D: No. We only know where R is, but not the position of the other articles.

Option E: This option gives us more information about the position of Y. If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be S, Q, G, and J in that order. Because S must be earlier than Q and J must be earlier than G. Finally, we know that R and H are the two articles left. Because we can't have consecutive articles cover the same topic, H must be sixth and R must be seventh.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are seven articles to edit: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y. 
  Three articles are about finance: G, H, and J.
  Three articles are about nutrition: Q, R, and S.
  One article is about wildlife: Y.
  In order to be valid, the order of the articles must comply with the following rules:
  1. Consecutive articles cannot have the same topic.
  2. S can be before Q only if Q is third.
  3. S must be before Y.
  4. J must be before G, and G must be before R.

A is incorrect because knowing the position of H does not provide any information on the other articles' positions. 
B is incorrect because Y can't be fifth since S must be before Y. 
C is incorrect because even if R is fourth, it is impossible to know if the other articles will fill the previous slots and if they will be valid in respect to the rules. 
D is also incorrect. Suppose R is seventh, then G must be in the fourth position. However, S must be before G, and since S cannot be in the seventh position, there is no valid order of the articles. 

Knowledge: 
The only option that has a chance of providing a full order is E since it constrains the position of Y, which in turn constrains the position of S, leaving only one position for Q. If Q is third, it is possible to determine the full order.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 7 articles to be edited one at a time: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y. 
  - Three articles cover finance: G, H, and J. 
  - Three articles cover nutrition: Q, R, and S. 
  - One article covers wildlife: Y. 
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. 
  - The order in which the articles are edited is subject to certain conditions:
    - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is the third article (Q cannot be first or second if S is earlier than Q).
    - S must be earlier than Y.
    - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
    
A: If H is fourth, there are two possible sequences for the first four articles: either the first three are all on nutrition and the fourth on finance, or the first three are all on finance and the fourth on nutrition. In either case, it is still possible to arrange the remaining articles such that consecutive articles have different topics. Therefore, knowing that H is fourth does not fully determine the order in which the articles are edited. 

B: If H is sixth, then G must be either the fourth or fifth article (since J must be earlier than G), and it must be on finance (since the third nutrition article, S, must be earlier than Y). However, this still allows for several different sequences of the first five articles, so knowing that H is sixth does not fully determine the order in which the articles are edited.

C: If R is fourth, then S must be the third article (since S can be earlier than Q only if Q is the third article), and Q must be the first article among the nutrition articles (since R must be later than both G and F). This leaves only two possibilities for the first two articles: either both are on finance and one of them is G and the other is H, or one is on finance (either G or H) and the other is on nutrition (not Q). This fully determines the order in which the articles are edited. 

D: If R is seventh, then Y must be the sixth article (since S must be earlier than Y), and R must be the fifth article (since G must be earlier than R). This leaves only one possibility for the order of the first four articles: Q (nutrition), S (nutrition), G (finance), H (finance). This, however, leaves two possibilities for the order of the fifth and sixth articles: R (nutrition) then Y (wildlife), or Y (wildlife) then R (nutrition). Therefore, knowing that R is seventh does not fully determine the order in which the articles are edited.

E: If Y is fifth, then S must be the first article (since S must be earlier than Y), and Q must be the third article (since S can be earlier than Q only if Q is the third article). This means that R must be the last article (since G must be earlier than R). This leaves only two possibilities for the order of the second, third, and fourth articles: either G followed by Q followed by H (all finance), or H followed by Q followed by G (all finance). Therefore, knowing that Y is fifth does fully determine the order in which the articles are edited.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
  - G, H, and J are about finance.
  - Q, R, and S are about nutrition.
  - Y is about wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, G must be earlier than R.
  
Analysis:
  - If H is fourth, then the first three articles cannot cover nutrition. Therefore, since S must be earlier than Y, S cannot be the first article, which means that Q must be first, followed by R. This leaves only one order for the finance articles, and only one order for the remaining articles. Therefore, the order is fully determined. 
  - If H is sixth, or R is fourth, then the first three articles must cover nutrition, which means that Q is the first article, and S is either second or third. However, the order of the remaining articles is not fully determined. Therefore, neither of these statements is sufficient to fully determine the order.
  - If R is seventh, then the first three articles must cover nutrition, and Q must be first, with S second and R third. But this leaves open the possibility of two different orders for the finance articles, and two different orders for the remaining articles. Therefore, the order is not fully determined. 
  - If Y is fifth, then S must be the first article, followed by Q, R, G, J, H, and Y. But the order of the finance articles is not fully determined, since either G or J could come first. Therefore, this statement is not sufficient to fully determine the order.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Seven articles will be edited one at a time:
    1. G
    2. H
    3. J
    4. Q or R or S
    5. one of Q, R
    6. the other of Q, R
    7. Y
  - G, H, and J are finance articles, Q, R, and S are nutrition articles, and Y is a wildlife article.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G and G must be earlier than R.

Analysis:
  - If H is fourth or sixth, this tells us nothing about the ordering of the articles that has not already been determined by the conditions given.
  - If R is fourth, then G and J must be first and second. In that case, the only allowable ordering of the articles that follow is S, Q, Y, R. This satisfies all of the conditions.
  - If Y is fifth, then S must be first or second to avoid violating the condition that S must be earlier than Y. If S is first, then Q and R must be third and fourth, but this violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. If S is second, then Q or R must be first which also violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - If R is seventh, then G and J must be first and second. In that case, the only allowable ordering of the articles that follow is S, Q, R, Y. However, this violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Order of topics for the articles: F,F,N,N,W,N,N
  S should be before Q if Q is not third.
  Given the conditions, the sequence of edited articles can only be three different possibilities: 
    1) F-N-F-N-W-N-Q-J-R-S
    2) N-F-N-F-W-Q-N-J-R-S
    3) N-F-N-F-W-Q-N-R-J-S
Action: Answer("D")   
If R is seventh, then it must be followed by S. If S is sixth or earlier, then Q must be third, which violates the rules that consecutive articles can't cover the same topic and that S must be earlier than Y. Thus, the only possible sequence with R as the last article would be F-N-F-N-W-H-Q-J-S-R. However, this violates the rule that J must be earlier than G, so R can't be the last article. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is NOT fully determined if R is the seventh article.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The order of the articles must alternate between finance, nutrition, and wildlife.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  - Based on these conditions, the possible orders of the articles are:
    1. G -> Q -> S -> R -> H -> J -> Y
    2. J -> G -> Q -> S -> R -> H -> Y
    3. H -> R -> S -> Q -> G -> J -> Y
    4. J -> G -> S -> Q -> R -> H -> Y
    5. H -> R -> Q -> S -> G -> J -> Y
    6. J -> G -> R -> Q -> S -> H -> Y
    7. H -> R -> Q -> S -> J -> G -> Y
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- There are seven articles: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.
- Three articles are on finance: G, H, and J.
- Three articles are on nutrition: Q, R, and S.
- The remaining article is on wildlife: Y.
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same subject.
- The order of articles is subject to certain conditions:
  - S cannot be earlier than Q unless Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

A: H is fourth: This does not determine the order because it only identifies one article's position and does not give information on the other articles' positions.

B: H is sixth: This does not determine the order because it only identifies one article's position and does not give information on the other articles' positions.

C: R is fourth: This does not determine the order because it only identifies one article's position and does not give information on the other articles' positions.

D: R is seventh: This does not determine the order because it only identifies one article's position and does not give information on the other articles' positions.

E: Y is fifth: The order of Q, R, S, and Y can be determined by the following conditions: 
- S must be earlier than Y, so S must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Q must be in position 3, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- R must be after G, so G must be in position 1, and R must be in position 6 or 7.
- Since H is one of the finance articles, it cannot be second or third, so it must be in position 4, 5, 6 or 7.
- J must be before G, so it must be in position 1 or 2.

Since Y is in position 5, we know article S must be in position 1, Q must be in position 3, and R must be in position 7. We can then place G and H in positions 2 and 4 (in any order) and place J in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the order of articles is fully determined.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
To satisfy the given conditions, we can list minimum feasible positions of articles as follows:

4 3 6 7 2 1 5  
G H Q R S J Y  

Where each number indicates the order of the article to be edited, and the capital letters correspond to the articles themselves.
   
Analyzing the options:
A: H is fourth. The consecutive articles (3rd and 4th) would cover Nutrition, which is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot place H in the fourth position.
B: H is sixth. H could be either before or after S (condition 2). The article in the fifth position can only be Q, since the previous three positions are occupied (condition 1), therefore, the sixth position would be the first available for H, and it can be either before or after S, giving us two possibilities of orderings. Thus, this choice cannot determine the fully determined order in which the articles would be edited.
C: R is fourth. The fourth position can only be occupied by Q or S (condition 1), therefore R cannot be in the fourth position, thus this choice cannot determine the full order as well.
D: R is seventh. Y should be in position five (condition 3), and X positions should be occupied by the articles on Nutrition, which is not possible since both Q and S should be placed before R (condition 5), therefore, it's not possible to put R in the seventh position.
E: Y is fifth. Since Y must be the fifth article, the first four positions should be occupied by the articles on nutrition - Q and S (condition 1), the article order will be:  

3 4 5 _ _ _ _  
Q S Y _ _ _ G/J  

Where the remaining three articles - G, J, and either R or H - should be placed in the last three positions. R cannot be placed in the last position (condition 5), therefore the only proper ordering satisfying all conditions would be:

3 4 5 7 6 1 2  
Q S Y R G H J

Therefore, the fully determined order in which the articles are edited if Y is fifth is Answer("E").

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  This problem presents a scenario with 8 books placed on 3 shelves, where each shelf has at least 2 books. 
  We know that:
  1. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  2. I is placed on the middle shelf.
  3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then we can conclude that:
  - There are at least two other books on the top shelf with G. 
  - We have 5 books left to place on the middle and bottom shelves.
  - There are at least 3 books on the bottom shelf, due to condition 1.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf, due to condition 2.
Action: Answer("A") 
  We cannot place K on the top shelf because it would violate condition 3.
  We cannot place O on the top shelf because it would violate condition 4.
  We cannot place F and M on the top shelf because F is placed on the same shelf as M, due to condition 5.
  Therefore, all the remaining books must be placed on the bottom two shelves.
  This leaves the middle shelf with only I.
  Thus, the only answer choice that includes I by itself is A: H, I.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The total number of books is eight, so exactly three books must be on the top shelf and bottom shelf. Thus, there must be at least two books placed on the middle shelf. 
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is on the top shelf, then H and L must be on the bottom shelf since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. 
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so it must be on the middle or top shelf. 
Action: Answer("D") 
If G is placed on the top shelf, then three books must be on the bottom shelf, including H and L. We know that I is in the middle, so K and O must be on the middle or top shelf. F and M must be on the remaining shelf, which must be the middle. Thus, a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf could be I, K, and L. Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find a complete and accurate list of the books on the middle shelf.
  There are exactly three shelves, and more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, and F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the books left for the middle and the bottom shelf will be H, I, K, L, M, and O.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Since we need a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf, we can safely eliminate A, B, and C as they do not include K.
  D cannot be the answer, because K cannot be placed on the middle shelf.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The bookcase has three shelves only.
- I is on the middle shelf, and F is with M.
- K is on a higher shelf than F, and O is on a higher shelf than L.
- More books placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.

If G is on the top shelf, then:
- Two books must be on the same shelf as G.
- Three books (F, M, and K) are below G.
- Three books (H, I, and L) are either with G or above G.
- O is not on the top shelf since L isn't.

That leaves us with two possibilities:
1. G with two books are on the top shelf. L, O, and one of H and I are on the middle shelf.
2. G with three books are on the top shelf. Only H or I is on the middle shelf.

So, (A,B), (C,D), and (E) are not possible.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  We are given a set of 8 books, and are required to place them onto 3 shelves - top, middle, and bottom - such that no shelf is empty, at least two books are placed on each shelf, and certain conditions are met.
  We are told that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, I is placed on the middle shelf, K is placed higher than F, O is placed higher than L, F is on the same shelf as M.
  We know that if G is on the top shelf, then at most one other book can be placed on the top shelf.
  Since F is on the same shelf as M, both must be on either the middle or bottom shelves.
  Since I is placed on the middle shelf, one of H or L must be on the same shelf as it.
  K is placed higher than F, so if F and M are on the bottom shelf, then K, O, and either H or L must be on the top two shelves in some order. If F and M are on the middle shelf, then K, O, and either H or L must be on the top shelf in some order.
  We can eliminate choices A, B, and E since they do not contain either L or K, both of which must be on the top two shelves if G is on the top shelf, F and M are on the bottom shelf, and I is on the middle shelf.
  We can eliminate choice D since it contains K and L, but not H, and if K and L are on the same shelf, then one of them must be on the middle shelf, so H must be there as well.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The middle shelf contains exactly three books.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, and therefore it's not on the middle shelf.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then O must be placed on the bottom shelf since more books are on the bottom than the top.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and since F is not on the middle shelf, K is also not on the middle shelf.
  The remaining books that could be on the middle shelf are H and L.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) placed on a bookcase with 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, there are 2 books on the top shelf (G and at least one more), and at least 2 books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, there are exactly 3 books on the middle shelf.
  
Analysis:
  If G is on the top shelf, we know that it's not on the middle or bottom shelves, so neither is L or O. That means these two books must be on the top shelf. Since O is on a higher shelf than L, L is on the top shelf.  We know I is on the middle shelf, and F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, the books on the middle shelf are H, I, and K.
    
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, H, I, K, L, and M are on the other two shelves. Additionally, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, the only option from the list that includes I is D: I, K, L. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - A total of eight books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) are placed on a bookcase.
  - There are exactly three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - At least two books are placed on each shelf.
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Approach: 
  - If G is placed on the top shelf then there are three books on the top shelf.
  - The rest of the conditions already give a hint about the placement of some books on the bookcase.
  - We can use the statements to create a partial placement diagram to determine which one of the choices for the middle shelf is correct.

Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: 
  - We can assume that G is placed on the top shelf.
  - Three books are on the top shelf, so F and M must be placed on the bottom and middle shelves in some order.
  - According to the given conditions, I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can put I on the middle shelf and H and L on the bottom shelf.
  - K and O must go on the top and the middle shelves in some order. However, we do not have enough information to decide which book goes where.
  - The only choice that can be accurate and complete for the middle shelf is A: H and I. If K and O are not placed on the middle shelf, then there are only two books left to place, K and O, and they must go on the top and the bottom shelves in some order. That would mean that the middle shelf would be empty or contain only I, which violates the condition that at least two books are placed on each shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is A: H, I.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then M and F cannot be placed on the top shelf because F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  I is placed on the shelf different from G because the two articles must not be placed on the same shelf. 
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  H can be placed on any shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.

Elimination: 
  H must be placed on a shelf other than the middle one, otherwise, there will be no sufficient space for the remaining books in the remaining shelves. 
  Choice B is eliminated as it does not include I on the middle shelf as it is required by the given conditions.
  Choice C is also eliminated because L is placed on the bottom shelf according to constraint (4), hence it cannot be placed on the middle shelf too.
  Choice D cannot be correct because both K and L would be required to be on a higher shelf than I under such condition. 
  E is impossible because F and M cannot be placed on the top shelf according to the constraints given, but G is already placed there.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are six antiques to be auctioned on six consecutive days.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. 
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  We need to find the possible true statement(s) given that the table is auctioned on a later date than both the mirror and the vase. 

Analysis: 
  If the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and vase, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st because it has to be auctioned before the mirror and vase, which means that the mirror and vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Since the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on a date earlier than the table, because that would mean that the table had to be auctioned earlier then the mirror and vase, which would break the conditions. Thus, the table must be auctioned on June 6th. 

A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table. - Not possible as shown above.
B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. - Not enough information to determine this.
C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial. - Not possible as the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st.
D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. - This could be a true statement, because the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase.
E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. - This is not possible, because the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp can only be auctioned on June 1st if the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  1. There are six antiques: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, vase.
  2. Antiques are auctioned one per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th.
  3. Conditions:
    a. Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
    b. Harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp means the mirror is also auctioned earlier than the lamp.
    c. Sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror, and the vase.
    d. The table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica, or it is auctioned earlier than the vase.
  4. Table is auctioned later than both mirror and the vase.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation:  
  1. Table is not auctioned on June 1st, so only June 2nd to 6th is possible.
  2. Since the table is auctioned later than both the mirror and the vase, the harmonica, the lamp, and the sundial could only appear before the mirror and the vase. So, the harmonica, the lamp, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st to 3rd. Hence, the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or 3rd.
  3. The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, and the mirror must be auctioned on the other date.
  4. According to item "d", the table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  5. If the table is auctioned on June 6th (the last day), then the vase would be auctioned on June 5th or earlier, and the mirror would be auctioned on June 3rd or earlier. Then, the only possibility is that the harmonica, the lamp, and the sundial would be auctioned on June 1st to 3rd in some configuration. So, the only possible answer is D, in which mirror is auctioned earlier than the vase.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and before the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  - The table is auctioned after both the mirror and the vase.
  
Analysis:
  - Since the table is auctioned after both the mirror and the vase, the earliest date the table could be auctioned is June 4th (after the mirror and vase which can only be on June 2nd/3rd).
  - This means:
    - The harmonica and the table cannot be auctioned on the same date as the table should not be auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica.
    - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp as the lamp is the last antique to be auctioned, and the table is not auctioned on the last day.
    - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial as the table is not auctioned on the first day, and the sundial is not auctioned on the first day.
  - Therefore, the only remaining option is that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  We need to find a possible order for the auctioned antiques that satisfies the given conditions.
  The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  If harmonica < lamp, then mirror < lamp.
  sundial < mirror < vase.
  table < harmonica XOR table < vase.
  
Analysis:
  We are given that table > mirror and table > vase. If table < harmonica, then the only valid order for these three antiques would be: table > mirror > vase > harmonica. However, this order would not satisfy the condition that the table is auctioned after both mirror and vase. Therefore, we can conclude that table > harmonica or table > vase.
  From the condition that sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and sundial < mirror, we know that the earliest date for the mirror auction is June 2nd (and by transitivity, the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd). Since sundial < vase, the earliest date for vase could be June 3rd at the earliest, and June 4th at the earliest for lamp and harmonica.
  Now, we need to find a valid scenario where table is later than both mirror and vase.
  
Solution:
  June 1st: sun dial, June 2nd: mirror, June 3rd: vase, June 4th: harmonica, June 5th: lamp, June 6th: table
  In this scenario, table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned. 
  - Harmonica is auctioned earlier than the table, so A is not true.
  - Lamp is auctioned on June 5th, which is later than the date on which the table is auctioned (June 6th). So B is not true.
  - Sundial is auctioned on June 1st, which is earlier than the date on which the table is auctioned (June 6th). Hence, C is not true.
  - We have already determined that mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, which is earlier than the date on which vase is auctioned (June 3rd). Therefore, D could be true.
  - We have already determined that sundial is auctioned on June 1st, which is earlier than the date on which the lamp is auctioned (June 5th). Therefore, E is not true.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. The schedule for the auction of the antiques is: June 1st - ?, June ? - ?, June ? - ?, June ? - ?, June ? - ?, June ? - ?
  2. Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  3. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  4. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  5. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  1. Since the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the auction date of the mirror and the vase, the sundial and harmonica have to be auctioned before the table.
  2. Therefore, the schedule for the auction of the antiques should be: June 1st - sundial, June 2nd - harmonica, June 3rd - mirror, June 4th - vase, June 5th - ?, June 6th - table
  
Knowledge:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table. This cannot be true, since the table is auctioned on June 6th, and the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This could be true, since we do not know the June 5th auction item relative to the table and the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial. This cannot be true, since the sundial is auctioned on June 1st, and the table is auctioned on June 6th.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. This must be true. From the schedule above, the mirror is auctioned on June 3rd and the vase on June 4th.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This cannot be true, since the lamp is auctioned after the harmonica, which is auctioned on June 2nd, after the sundial is auctioned on June 1st.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  
  We know from the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.

Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  - Possible order of auction for June 1st to June 6th based on given conditions:  
    June 1st: (not)sundial
    June 2nd: Harmonica or Lamp*
    June 3rd: Harmonica or Lamp*
    June 4th: Sundial or Vase**
    June 5th: Mirror
    June 6th: Table

  * if Harmonica is before Lamp
  ** if Sundial is before Vase

  From the possible order, we can see that options A, B, and C cannot be true. Option D is possible. Option E cannot be true because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Table auctioned before Harmonica or Vase or both.
- Vase is auctioned on a date that is later than the date on which the sundial is auctioned.
- If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
- The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also the vase if not auctioned before it.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. The six antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  2. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  3. If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  4. The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and before the vase.
  5. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both.
  6. The question asks what could be true if the table is auctioned later than the dates of the mirror and the vase.

Analysis:
  Since the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is always auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase. 
  A: The harmonica cannot be auctioned before the table, so A is not possible.
  B: The table could be auctioned after the lamp, so B is not necessarily true.
  C: The table must be auctioned after the sundial because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned before the harmonica which cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table. Therefore, C is not possible.
  D: According to condition 4, the mirror is always auctioned before the vase, so D is not possible. 
  E: The sundial is never auctioned before the lamp, so E is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. 
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  
  The question asks what could be true when the table is auctioned on a date later than the date the mirror and vase are auctioned. This means the sundial will either be on June 1st or June 2nd because the sundial must be auctioned before the vase and mirror. Because the table can't be after both the harmonica and vase, and the harmonica has to be after the lamp if it is auctioned first, we know that the table comes before the vase. 

Analysis:
  A: The harmonica can't be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because we know that the table must come before the harmonica or the vase.
  B: The table can't be auctioned earlier than the lamp because the lamp must come before the mirror if the harmonica is auctioned after it, and the mirror must come before the table if the table is auctioned after the mirror.
  C: The table can't be auctioned earlier than the sundial because the sundial must come on June 1st or 2nd, and the table must come earlier than the harmonica or the vase.
  D: This could be true. If the table is auctioned after the vase and mirror, then the mirror must come before the vase, meaning the vase cannot be auctioned before the table. Also, the table has to come before the harmonica or the vase, so this leaves the vase to be auctioned on day 6.
  E: The sundial cannot be auctioned after June 2nd because it has to be auctioned before the vase and the mirror.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, implies:
    * If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, then the mirror is also auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. 
    * If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th, then the mirror is also auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th. 
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, implies: 
    * If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, then the vase is auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, and the mirror is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
    * If the sundial is auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, then the vase is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, and the mirror is auctioned on June 6th.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or before the vase, implies: 
    * If the table is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, then the auction date of the harmonica and the vase must be June 3rd or June 4th, but there is no condition on the order of these two items.
    * If the table is auctioned after June 2nd, then it is not possible for the harmonica or the vase to be auctioned before the table.
  
Action: 
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, it is possible that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table. Option A is the best answer. Answer("A")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The veterinarian is in space 5.
- If the pharmacy is not next to the veterinarian, then the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist.
- The optometrist and pharmacy must be at the ends of the row.
- One of the restaurants must also be at the end of the row, and the other restaurant must be separated by at least two businesses.
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Analysis:
- Using the rules above, the optometrist and pharmacy must occupy spaces 1 and 7, but we do not know which one is in which space.
- One restaurant must be at space 1 or space 7, but not space 2 or space 6, because it must be separated from the other restaurant by at least two businesses.
- Another restaurant can only be placed at space 3 or space 4.
- The toy store cannot be in space 4, because that would mean it is next to the veterinarian. It also cannot be in space 2 or space 6, because those spaces are next to the optometrist and pharmacy, respectively. Therefore, it must be in space 3.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  We have seven spaces and seven businesses that have to be placed in those spaces with the following constraints:
  1. Pharmacy must be at one end of the row, which means pharmacy should be in either space 1 or space 7.
  2. One restaurant must be at the other end of the row, which means a restaurant should be in either space 1 or space 7.
  3. Two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means the restaurant that is not at either end of the row should be in either space 3, 4, or 5.
  4. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy should be either in space 6 or space 4. 
  5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. This means that the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6 as these are the spaces adjacent to space 5 where the veterinarian is.
  
Analysis: 
  We know the veterinarian is in space 5, which means that there are only two possible places for the pharmacy, either space 4 or space 6. Using the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the possible arrangement of the seven businesses will be the following:
  _ _ _ _ _ _ _
  The arrangement can start with either a restaurant or a pharmacy, but let's start with a restaurant in space 1:
  R _ _ _ _ _ P
  The only possible place for the second restaurant is either space 3 or space 7, but if we put it in space 3, the shoe store and toy store would not have any space between them, which violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the second restaurant must be in space 7:
  R _ _ _ _ R P
  Since we know the veterinary is in space 5, there are only two possible places for the pharmacy, either space 4 or space 6. If the pharmacy is in space 4, then the optometrist must be in space 6 as the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. However, this violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 6 and the optometrist in space 4:
  R _ _ O _ R P
  The last remaining business is the shoe store which must be in space 2 as it cannot be next to the toy store:
  R S _ O _ R P
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The veterinarian is in space 5.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Reasoning:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7, and one of the restaurants must be in the other end, either space 1 or space 7.
  Therefore, restaurant has to be in space 7 or space 1
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. 
  For restaurant in space 7, one of the restaurant's neighboring businesses could only be the toy store, which is impossible since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the restaurant must be in space 1.
  Then, the optometrist or the veterinarian will be next to the pharmacy. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 7 with the optometrist in space 6 or 1 with the optometrist in space 2. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian; therefore, the toy store must be in space 3 and the shoe store in space 4.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  We know that there are seven businesses: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  There are seven spaces: space 1 through space 7 arranged in a straight row.
  The pharmacy is at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, it cannot be adjacent to the toy store.
Analysis:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then we know that the pharmacy is either in space 4 or space 6 by rule. 
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian; therefore, if we place the pharmacy in space 6, there are no spaces for the optometrist. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 4 and the optometrist must be in space 6. 
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant that is not at the end of the row must be either in space 2 or space 3.
  The toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6, so it must be in space 3. 
  That leaves only space 7 for the shoe store.
  Therefore, C must be true: a restaurant is in space 4.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The veterinarian is in space 5.
  The pharmacy is at one of the ends of the row and next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  One of the restaurants is at the other end of the row.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Analysis:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, the optometrist must be in space 4 or 6, and the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or 7.
  In order to satisfy the constraint that the restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, either the optometrist or the pharmacy must be in space 2, 3, or 4.
  If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist must be in space 4, the veterinarian in space 5, and the two restaurants in spaces 1 and 2, or vice versa.
  Therefore, neither A nor B is true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The veterinarian is in space 5.

Process of elimination:
  - A cannot be true because there are no constraints on the optometrist's location.
  - B cannot be true because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  - C could be true because one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row.
  - D cannot be true because the shoe store's location is not constrained.
  - E cannot be true because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, who is in space 5.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then we know that spaces 4 and 6 are not occupied by the toy store.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  There are seven spaces for seven businesses: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.

Solving the problem:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, then we know that spaces 4 and 6 are not occupied by the toy store. This narrows down the options to A, B, and C.
  Using the other constraints, we can deduce the likely position of the other businesses in relation to the veterinarian.

  Let's consider the constraint that pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants must be at the other: 

  If the pharmacy is in space 1, the other restaurant must be in space 4, since the two restaurants need to be separated by two businesses. Then, the optometrist or veterinarian occupies space 2, and the shoe store is in space 3. This means the toy store must be in space 6. Therefore, A cannot be true.

  If the pharmacy is in space 7, other constraints dictate that one restaurant must be in space 3, and the other in space 4 or 2. In both cases, the optometrist must be in space 1, and the shoe store must be in space 2 or 5, depending on the position of the second restaurant. Then, the toy store must be in space 4 or 6.

  We know that the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7 based on the first constraint. And the constraints dictate that one of the restaurants must occupy space 7 if the pharmacy is in space 1, or space 3 if the pharmacy is in space 7. Therefore, we can conclude that C must be true, which is "A restaurant is in space 4."
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in a straight row, numbered 1 through 7.
  - There are seven businesses: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row while one of the restaurants must be at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  -The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  - If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the pharmacy must be in space 4 or 6 because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - Also, because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, spaces 1, 2, and 3 cannot be restaurants. Therefore, if Space 1 is not the pharmacy, then a restaurant must be in Space 1 to satisfy the constraint that a restaurant must be at one end of the row. This means that Space 4 is not a restaurant.
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it cannot be in Space 4 or 6.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, if the veterinarian is in space 5, then a restaurant is in space 4.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If the veterinarian is in space 5, he is located in the middle of the row.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Analysis:
  Based on the constraints, the pharmacy can only be located in either space 1 or space 7, but not next to the restaurant.
  Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, the optometrist must be located next to the pharmacy, which means the optometrist must be in space 6.
  The restaurant cannot be located right next to the pharmacy, so it can only be in space 2 or space 6. 
  If the restaurant is in space 2, then the toy store must be in space 4, which violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Hence, a restaurant must be in space 6 and a toy store in space 3.
  The only vacant places left are space 4 and space 7. Space 4 must be occupied by the shoe store.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - In a shopping center arranged in a straight row with 7 spaces, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the space numbers are: [ ][ ][ ][ ][V][ ][ ]
Analysis:
If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the only places where the pharmacy can be located are in spaces 1 or 7. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, then one of the restaurants must be in space 7. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 since it must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian.
The optometrist cannot be in space 2 since it must be next to the pharmacy, which is in space 1. Therefore, option A is not true.
The pharmacy is in space 1, therefore option B is true.
The first two spaces are occupied by the pharmacy and the optometrist, which means that there are at most two spaces between them. Therefore, a restaurant cannot be in space 4. Therefore, option C is not true.
Since the pharmacy is in space 1 and the veterinarian is in space 5, then the shoe store is in space 6. Therefore, option D is true.
The toy store cannot be in space 3 since it is next to the veterinarian, which is in space 5. Therefore, option E is not true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are six colors of thread that will be used to weave three rugs; exactly five colors will be used, one color will not be used.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs can be solid - woven in a single color- or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. 
  If olive is used, then peach is also used in the same rug.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Analysis:
  A: It is possible that forest is used in a multicolored rug, which contradicts choice A.
  B: Turquoise is never used with forest while peach is never used with turquoise. Since there are only two multicolored rugs, turquoise is not present in one of them for sure, which makes choice B a possible answer.
  C: If yellow is never used with peach, then peach must be used. However, there is no guarantee that yellow will be used, so choice C is not true.
  D: Peach is never used with turquoise, so there is no guarantee that turquoise will be used. Therefore, choice D is not true.
  E: There are only five colors of thread, and peach cannot be used with yellow. Therefore, yellow cannot be excluded, so choice E is possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The rugs will be woven out of exactly five of six available colors, and each color will be used in only one rug. 
  In a rug with white, two other colors are used.
  In a rug with olive, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Eliminate choices one by one:
  A: There could be a multicolored rug with forest color that uses four other distinct colors with it, so this is not necessarily true.
  B: This is true because turquoise cannot be used with forest, peach or turquoise, so it cannot be used in a multicolored rug as at least two colors are required.
  C: This must be true, because peach is used in a rug with olive and olive cannot be used in another rug. 
  D: This could be false because of the rule that turquoise and forest cannot be used together. If both colors are not used in a single-color rug, then there could be no rugs with turquoise.
  E: This could be false because of the rule that peach and yellow cannot be used in the same rug. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread.
- Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs.
- Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
- The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored.
- White + 2 colors in a rug, Olive + Peach in a rug, Forest and Turquoise not used together, Peach and Turquoise not used together in a rug, Peach and Yellow not used together in a rug.

Analysis:
- Choice A: We don't know this yet. Forest could be used in a multicolored rug.
- Choice B: This could be true. Forest could be used in a multicolored rug, and Peach could be used in a solid-color rug. There would be no multicolor rug using Turquoise.
- Choice C: This could be true. According to the rules, Peach cannot be used with Turquoise or Yellow. So Peach could be used in a rug.
- Choice D: This could be true. According to the rules, Turquoise cannot be used with Forest or Peach. However, we cannot be sure that Turquoise will be used.
- Choice E: This could be true. There are only five colors available and one color will not be used. Thus, we can conclude that Yellow is used in one of the rugs since it's the only one left.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Six colors of thread are available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave three rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in exactly one of the rugs.
  White can be used in a rug only if two other colors are also used in that rug.
  Olive can only be used with peach.
  Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.

Analysis:
  From the given information, we know that there are three rugs, and each rug can either be multicolored or solid. Furthermore, we know that six colors of thread are available, exactly five of which will be used, and each color must be used in exactly one of the three rugs. Using the rules given, we can determine that some of the colors cannot be used together in a rug. Answer choices A, B, D, and E deal with usage of specific colors and can be ignored for now. 

Action: To determine which choice must be true, we need to analyze the given rules. We know that the color Peach appears in the rule stating that olive can only be used with peach. Since each color that is used will be used in exactly one of the three rugs, we can conclude that Peach must be used in one of the rugs. Therefore, the answer is C.

Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are six colors available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five colors will be used to weave the three rugs.
  Each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis:
  If A were true, then one of the rugs would be woven with only one color, which is not possible according to the rules.
  If B were true, then one of the multicolored rugs would have to be woven with four colors, which is not possible according to the rules.
  If C were true, then there must be a rug in which olive is used, which means there must be a rug in which peach is used as well.
  If D were true, then forest and turquoise cannot be used together, so there must be a rug in which forest is used.
  If E were true, then there must be a rug in which peach is used as well.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Six colors of thread are available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Three rugs are to be woven exactly five of the above six colors of thread.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid (i.e., woven in a single color) or multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Analysis: 
  Choice A cannot be true because forest can be used in a solid rug.
  Choice B cannot be true because turquoise can be used in a solid rug.
  Choice C must be true because olive must be paired with peach, and white must have two other colors, so there will be at least three colors in one rug, and therefore, peach must be used in one of the rugs.
  Choice D cannot be true because peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Choice E cannot be true because peach cannot be paired with yellow.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The rugs will be woven out of colored threads.
  Six colors of the thread are available, and exactly five of them will be used in each rug: 
    forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one rug.
  The rugs can be either solid (woven in a single color) or multicolored.
  In a rug in which white is used, two other colors (in addition to white) must be used.
  In a rug in which olive is used, peach must be used as well.
  Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.

Analysis:
  Choices A, B, and E cannot be determined from the rules.
  Choice C: Since peach is a required color when olive is used, and olive must be used if peach is used. Then it must be true that Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  Choice D: It is not specified in the rules that turquoise must be used in a rug. So, we cannot say for sure if it will be used or not. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The question provides information about the weaving of three rugs out of colored thread. 
  A total of six colors are available - forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow, exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. 
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rules that must be followed when weaving the rugs are:
  Rule 1: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. 
  Rule 2: In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. 
  Rule 3: Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. 
  Rule 4: Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. 
  Rule 5: Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Answer: "D"
Explanation: 
  One of the rules states that "Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug", which means that if there is a multicolored rug, it cannot have both peach and turquoise in it. 
  However, the other four colors can be used in the same multicolored rug. 
  Rule 3 states that "Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug", but it does not mean that either of forest or turquoise will not be used altogether. 
  The other rules do not give any information that determines the use of other colors in the rugs. 
  Therefore, it would be safe to say that turquoise must be used in one of the rugs. The correct choice is D.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There will be three rugs woven.
  The rugs will be either solid or multicolored.
  Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
Analysis:
  A: It's possible that there is a multicolored rug that contains forest, since there are five colors in total, and exactly five colors will be used collectively to weave the rugs. So it is not a must-have statement.
  B: If turquoise is used in a multicolored rug, none of the other colors that cannot be used with turquoise (peach and forest) can be used in that rug. Also, there are only five colors to choose from, so there will be no other additional colors to be used in that rug since each color will be used only once. Therefore, Turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug, which makes this statement a must-have.
  C: Based on the rule that says "In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used", Peach is used in at least 1 rug. Therefore, this statement is a must-have.
  D: Turquoise and forest are not used together in a rug, and neither are peach and turquoise. Therefore, it's possible that turquoise is not used in any of the rugs, and it's also possible that it is used in one of the solid color rugs. Thus, this statement is not a must-have.
  E: There are only five colors available to make the rugs. Each color is used only once in one rug, which means one color will not be used. Therefore, it is possible that yellow is not used in any of the rugs, so this statement is not a must-have.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are six colors of thread available for the rugs: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of these colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in exactly one of the rugs.
  The rules for weaving the rugs are:
    - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
    - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
    - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
    - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
    - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

A: This need not be true. There could be a multicolored rug in which forest is one of the colors that is used.
B: This could be true. Turquoise and forest cannot be used together in a rug. Since there are only five colors available, it is possible that no multicolored rugs will be woven using turquoise.
C: This must be true because olive cannot be used in a rug without peach, and no color can be used in more than one rug. If peach were not used in any rug, then olive could not be used in any rug either.
D: This need not be true. Turquoise is not used in a rug with peach, but it could be used in a rug with other colors.
E: This need not be true. Yellow could be one of the colors used in a multicolored rug that does not include peach.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians (Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang) will give four lectures on lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors, one lecture per person per topic.
  - The lectures will be given consecutively, and each art historian will talk about a different topic.
  - There are three constraints:
      1- The oil paintings and watercolors lectures must be given before the lithographs lecture.
      2- Farley's lecture is before the oil paintings lecture.
      3- Holden's lecture is before Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.
  
A: If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings and watercolors lectures should be given earlier than the lithographs lecture, which violates constraint 1. So A cannot be true.
B: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then there is no issue with the constraints. So B can be true.
C: If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then it must be earlier than the lithographs lecture (constraint 1). Therefore, Jiang should give the lithographs lecture, but Holden's lecture must be before Jiang, and Holden's lecture must be before Garcia's lecture. So this scenario violates constraint 3. Therefore, C cannot be true.
D: If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture should be before Holden (constraint 2), and there is no issue with the other constraints. So D can be true.
E: If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then it must be earlier than the lithographs lecture (constraint 1). Therefore, Farley should give the lithographs lecture, but Farley's lecture should be before the oil paintings lecture (constraint 2), and Holden's lecture should be before Jiang's lecture (constraint 3). So this scenario violates constraint 1. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Four art historians 
  - Each will give one of four public lectures, each on a different topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors 
  - The lectures will be scheduled one at a time with each historian giving a lecture of a different type 
  - There are constraints that affect the order of the lectures: 
    1. oil paintings and watercolors must both be before lithographs 
    2. Farley’s lecture must be prior to the oil paintings lecture 
    3. Holden’s lecture must be before Garcia’s and Jiang’s lectures 
  - We must determine which option CANNOT be true 

A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture - There are three lectures prior to the lithographs lecture: oil paintings, watercolors, and sculptures. But Farley’s lecture must occur before the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the lecture on lithographs.
B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture - We have no constraints that apply to the sculptures lecture, so it is possible that Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture - Holden’s lecture must be given before Garcia’s, and we know watercolors must be given before lithographs. Therefore, if Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, Holden must give the sculpture lecture, and Garcia’s lecture would be the third overall. This scenario meets all the constraints, so CANNOT be true.
D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture - If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then the only lecture that can be given after that is lithographs. Watercolors must be given before lithographs, and Holden's lecture is prior to Garcia’s and Jiang’s. But we cannot fit sculptures between oil paintings and lithographs. Therefore, this scenario CANNOT be true.
E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture - Holden’s lecture must be given before both Garcia’s and Jiang’s lectures. If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, Holden must give the sculpture lecture, and Jiang’s talk would be given fourth. This scenario meets all the constraints, so CANNOT be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The four historians will give lectures on four topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each historian will give a single lecture on one topic.
  - The lectures will be given one at a time.
  - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. (Possible - there is no rule against Farley giving the lithographs lecture.)
B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. (Possible - there is no rule against Garcia giving the sculptures lecture.)
C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture. (Possible - as long as the watercolors lecture is earlier than the lithographs lecture, and Holden's lecture is earlier than Garcia's lecture, this is possible.)
D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. (Not possible - the rule states that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Holden cannot give the oil paintings lecture.)
E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture. (Possible - as long as the watercolors lecture is earlier than the lithographs lecture, and Holden's lecture is earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, this is possible.)

Action: Answer("D") - Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden and Jiang.
  - Four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures and watercolors.
  - Each lecture is given by a different art historian.
  - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.

We can infer that:
- Farley cannot give the lithographs lecture because the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
- Garcia can give the sculptures or the watercolors lecture.
- Holden cannot give the oil paintings lecture because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
- Jiang can give the oil paintings lecture or the lithographs lecture if Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.

A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. Possible.
B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. Possible.
C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture. Possible.
D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. Impossible.
E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture. Possible, if Garcia gives the sculptures lecture

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, the order cannot be Oil paintings --> Lithographs --> Watercolors, because Watercolors comes earlier than Lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the Oil painting lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. In the order of Holden, Garcia, Jiang, Holden should come first. 
  Either Garcia or Jiang gives the lecture after Holden, but the other person gives the last lecture.
  Four people give four different lectures; therefore, each person can give only one lecture.
  
Process of elimination:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. (Possible. Does not violate any constraint.)
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. (Possible. Does not violate any constraint.)
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture. (Possible. Garcia can give the Watercolors lecture, as Holden must give his lecture before Garcia's, but it does not specify that someone else cannot give their lecture in between.)
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. (Not possible. Farley's lecture must come before the Oil paintings lecture. This violates the constraints.)
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture. (Not possible. Either Garcia or Jiang gives the lecture after Holden, but the other person gives the last lecture. If Garcia gives his lecture after Holden, then Jiang cannot give the last lecture, and vice versa.)
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Four art historians will give one public lecture each, on lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
- Each art historian must give a lecture on a different topic.
- The lectures will be given one at a time.
- There are several constraints governing the schedule of the lectures:
    - The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
    - Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
    - Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

A: If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, he would have to give his lecture after the oil painting lecture, which contradicts the constraints. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, it would mean that he has to give the fourth lecture, meaning that the watercolors lecture would be given before the lithographs lecture. This violates the constraint that the watercolors lecture must be given before the lithographs lecture. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: This is a possible schedule, as long as Garcia's lecture is given before Jiang's lecture, and both their lectures are after Holden's lecture.
D: This is also a possible schedule, as long as Holden's lecture is before both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, which would place the oil paintings lecture within the constraints.
E: This is possible, as long as Jiang's lecture is the last one, after the sculptures lecture (given by Garcia), and the lithographs lecture (most likely given by Farley).

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The schedule has four lectures, with each one on a different topic: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must be given before the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture comes before the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture comes before both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.

Analyzing the choices:
  A: If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lectures must be given before the lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint that Farley's lecture must come before the oil paintings lecture - Possible.
  B: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden would have to give the watercolors lecture and Jiang would have to give the oil paintings lecture, and that violates the constraint that Holden must give his lecture before both Garcia and Jiang - Possible.
  C: If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden must give the oil paintings lecture, and that violates the constraint that Holden must give his lecture before both Garcia and Jiang - Possible.
  D: If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley must give the watercolors lecture, and that violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture - Not possible.
  E: If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden must give the oil paintings lecture, and that violates the constraint that Holden must give his lecture before both Garcia and Jiang - Possible.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  There are four topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each historian gives a lecture on a different topic.
  Farley must go before oil paintings.
  Oil paintings and watercolors must go before lithographs.
  Holden must go before Garcia and Jiang.
  We are asked for a statement that CANNOT be true.
  
Analysis: 
  We can start by drawing a timeline of which lectures must come before or after others based on the given constraints: 
  Farley --> Oil Paintings --> Watercolors --> Lithographs
  
  Now we can evaluate each answer choice:
  A: If Farley gave the lithographs lecture, it would violate the constraint that Farley must speak before the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, this CANNOT be true. 
  B: Garcia giving the sculptures lecture would not violate any constraints. This COULD be true. 
  C: Garcia giving the watercolors lecture is allowed by the constraints. This COULD be true. 
  D: If Holden gave the oil paintings lecture, then Farley would have to give the watercolors lecture and Jiang would have to give the lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint that watercolors must come before lithographs. Therefore, this CANNOT be true.
  E: Jiang giving the watercolors lecture is allowed by the constraints. This COULD be true. 
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are four topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each of the four historians will give one lecture on one of these topics.
  - Neither oil paintings nor watercolors can be last because the lithographs lecture must be last.
  - Farley’s lecture must be before the oil paint lecture, meaning his lecture must be either first or second.
  - Holden’s lecture must be before both Garcia’s and Jiang’s lectures, indicating that his lecture must be first.
  
Analysis: 
  - According to the given information, Option A, Farley giving the lithographs lecture, cannot be true because Farley must give a lecture before oil paintings, which should be earlier than lithographs. 
  - Option B, Garcia giving the sculptures lecture, is possible since there is no constraint that Garcia’s lecture cannot be on sculptures.
  - Option C, Garcia giving the watercolors lecture, is also possible since Garcia can give a lecture on watercolors. 
  - Option D, Holden giving the oil paintings lecture, is not possible because Holden must give the first lecture and Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  - Option E, Jiang giving the watercolors lecture, is possible since there are no constraints against Jiang's lecture being on watercolors.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Four art historians are Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
  - Four topics are lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  - Each lecturer will give one lecture and each lecture will be on a different topic.
  - Oil paintings and watercolors lectures are both before the lithographs lecture.
  - Farley's lecture is before the oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden's lecture is before Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  
  A: Farley must be before oil paintings lecture which is before lithographs lecture. So, this cannot be true.
  B: This can be true. No constraints are violated.
  C: This violates the constraint that watercolors lecture must be before lithographs which is not possible.
  D: This can be true as long as Farley is before the Oil paintings lecture and Oil painting lecture is before Lithographs.
  E: This can be true as long as Holden gives the first lecture, then Garcia has sculptures while Jiang has watercolors, and Farley has Lithographs.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue must be mentioned exactly once and in a different chapter.
  - T can't be mentioned in chapter 1, and must be mentioned before W with two chapters separating them.
  - S and Z can't be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X can't be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  A: No information regarding the clue R is given, so it could be true.
  B: No information regarding the clue S is given, so it could be true.
  C: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and T must be mentioned before W with two chapters separating them. Since Z is the last chapter, W must be mentioned in chapter 5. Therefore, T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or 3. So, it could be true.
  D: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and the previous reasoning rules out T being mentioned in chapter 2 since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and X can't be in chapter 1 due to T being available for chapter 2 and R being unmentioned so far. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  E: W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and X must be in an adjacent chapter with U. T cannot be in chapter 1, so it can only be in chapter 2 or 3. Therefore, U and X must be in chapters 4 and 5 in some order so that Z can be in chapter 7. This means X cannot be in chapter 5, so it cannot be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Seven clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, Z) should be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  2. T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  3. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  4. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  5. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  6. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Applying constraint #3, T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, or 4. T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. So, T cannot be in chapter 1.

Applying constraint #6, U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, if X appears in chapter 5, then U must appear in chapter 4 or 6.

If Z is mentioned last, in chapter 7, then applying constraint #4, S cannot be in chapters 6 or 8, but can be in any other chapter. However, introducing S in chapter 3 violates constraint #4. 

Applying constraint #3 further, if T is in chapter 2, then W must be in chapter 5 or 6. If W is in chapter 6, then U is in chapter 5 and X is in chapter 7. This violates constraint #5. So, W must be in chapter 5 if T is in chapter 2. But, this violates constraint #4 as S cannot be in chapter 4 or 6.

Applying constraint #3 further, if T is in chapter 3, then W must be in chapter 6. If W is in chapter 6, then U is in chapter 5 and X is in chapter 7. This satisfies all the given constraints.

Applying constraint #3 further, if T is in chapter 4, then W must be in chapter 7. If W is in chapter 7, then X must be in chapter 5 and U must be in chapter 6. This also satisfies all the given constraints.

So, T can be in chapter 3 or 4. If T is in chapter 3, then S cannot be in chapter 2. So, S can only be in chapter 1. Similarly, R cannot be in chapter 2. So, R must be in chapter 3. So, A is not a valid option.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven different clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each of them is mentioned exactly once in one chapter from chapter 1 to chapter 7.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W, with two chapters separating T and W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Analysis: 
  - Chapter 7 must have Z.
  - T must be before W, and both cannot be in Chapter 1.
  - S cannot be in Chapter 6 because Z is in Chapter 7 and S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters. 
  - Therefore, S must be in Chapter 2, 3, or 4 to avoid being adjacent to Z in Chapter 7.
  - Because T cannot be in Chapter 1, it must be either in Chapter 2 or 4.
  - To satisfy the condition that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T and W, T must be in Chapter 4 and W must be in Chapter 7.
  - X and U must be in adjoining chapters. Since they need to be added after T and W, they can only be added in Chapters 5 and 6, and in that order.
  - This leaves only Chapter 1 for R.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The mystery novel consists of seven chapters, mentioning each of these clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z— exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. 
  - T must be mentioned before W
  - There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. 
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: 
If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, we know already that it is not adjacent to S. Therefore, we can try to create scenarios for each option that satisfy all other conditions mentioned in the context:
  A. R is mentioned in chapter 3. If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T cannot be mentioned before W due to constraint "T must be mentioned before W". So, this scenario is not possible.
  B. S is mentioned in chapter 3. If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 due to the constraint "S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters". Also, U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and we have only two possible positions left (chapter 5 and chapter 6). Therefore, we can place U in chapter 5, followed by X in chapter 6. This means T must be in chapter 2, W must be in chapter 4, and R must be in chapter 1 or 7. So, this scenario is possible.  
  C. T is mentioned in chapter 4. If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be in chapter 6, and so X must be in chapter 5 due to the constraint "W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters." Thus, the only remaining spots for U and S are chapters 1 and 2 respectively, which are optimal options for both. Therefore, this scenario is possible.
  D. U is mentioned in chapter 1. If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be in chapter 2, which violates the constraint "U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters." So, this scenario is not possible.
  E. X is mentioned in chapter 5. If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be in chapter 7 and U must be in chapter 6. Then, according to the constraint "U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters", we can place S, T, R, and Z in the remaining spots. So, this scenario is possible.

Thus, we have two possible scenarios - B and C, making the answer "B or C". Answer("B or C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven different clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, Z
  - Each chapter can only mention one clue, and each clue must appear in exactly one chapter
  - T cannot be in chapter 1, and T must be before W by exactly two chapters
  - S and Z cannot appear in adjacent chapters
  - W and X cannot appear in adjacent chapters
  - U and X must appear in adjacent chapters
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Because T cannot be mentioned in Chapter 1, and it must be before W by exactly two chapters, the order of T and W is determined. We know that Z appears in Chapter 7, so if U and X appear in adjacent chapters, then they must appear in Chapters 5 and 6, in some order. That leaves Chapters 2, 3, and 4 for S, R, and T. However, S and Z cannot appear in adjacent chapters, so Z must appear in Chapter 7, and therefore S must appear earlier. Since R cannot appear in Chapter 1, and S must appear earlier, that leaves Chapter 3 for R and Chapter 4 for T. Therefore, it is possible for T to appear in Chapter 4.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- There are 7 chapters in total.
- Each chapter must contain a unique clue exactly once.
- T cannot appear in the first chapter.
- T must be mentioned before W, and with exactly 2 chapters separating them.
- S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
- U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: Answer("E")
Explanation:
If Z is mentioned in chapter 7:
- S cannot be in chapter 6, so S must be in chapters {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Z cannot be in chapter 6, so W must be in chapter 6 and T must be in chapter {4, 5}.
- T cannot be in the first chapter, so T must be in the chapters {2, 3, 5}.
- W is in chapter 6, which means X cannot be in chapters {5, 7}. X must be in chapter 6.
- U must be in chapter 7 to be adjacent to X.
- R is the only letter left, which means R must be in chapter 3.
Therefore, choice E, X is mentioned in chapter 5, is not true.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z.
  - Each clue is used exactly once, one per chapter.
  - T cannot be in chapter 1, must be before W with two chapters in between the mentions of T and W.
  - S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  - Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
  
  A: There are two chapters between chapter 3 and chapter 7 where clues W and X must be mentioned.  They cannot be in consecutive chapters. Because there are only two chapters between 3 and 7, chapter 5 must be one of those chapters. Then chapter 6 must be the other.  Then chapter 4 must have clue T. So, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: It is not possible for S to be mentioned with Z in chapter 7 because they cannot come in adjacent chapters.
  C: If T is in chapter 4, clue W must be in chapter 6 and X must be in chapter 5. Then S must be in chapter 2 and U must be in chapter 1. Clue Z then must be in chapter 7. So, T being in chapter 4 is a possibility.
  D: U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 because T cannot be in chapter 1. 
  E: If X is mentioned in chapter 5, U must be mentioned in chapter 6 and W must be in chapter 7. Then T must be in chapter 4, and S must be in chapter 3. Therefore, X cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 because S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Clues: R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z
  - Seven chapters: chapter 1 through chapter 7
  - Each clue appears one time in one chapter.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
Solution: 
- If Z is mentioned in chapter 7 and there should not be an S in an adjacent chapter, then S could be mentioned in chapter 5 at the earliest.
- Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and there must be two chapters between T and W, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, and W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7. 
- Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, if X is in chapter 5 then U must be in chapter 4, which leaves T to be in chapter 3, and W to be in chapter 7. 
- R must be mentioned in chapter 1 or 2, if T is mentioned in chapter 3, and since U cannot be mentioned earlier than X, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. 
- Therefore, the only option that could be true is option E, X is mentioned in chapter 5.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The seven clues are: R, S, T, U, W, X, Z.
  Clues T and W must be separated by exactly 2 chapters, with T preceding W.
  Clues S and Z must not be in adjacent chapters.
  Clues W and X must not be in adjacent chapters.
  Clues U and X must be in adjacent chapters.
  Chapter 7 is the last and final chapter in the novel.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: Since Z is mentioned exactly once in chapter 7, clue T cannot appear in chapter 7. The only choice that does not conflict with Z being in chapter 7 is C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Seven clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, Z) are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter.
  2. T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  3. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  4. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  5. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  6. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  
  Plan: 
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then the possible clues that could be mentioned in chapter 6 and 5 are U and X, but we know U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. 
  So, X must be mentioned in chapter 5 and U must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Now, we need to use the constraints to find possible placement of remaining clues. 
  
  A: No information about R is given. So, R can be mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: No information about S is given.
  C: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 as it must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  D: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: We already know X is mentioned in chapter 5.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  For the year 1923, only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned. 
  If Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned to the project. 
  If Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Yoshio is not assigned, then the four students assigned to the project are among Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
Analysis:
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, Ryan is not assigned too (based on the condition between Tiffany and Ryan).
  If Ryan is not assigned, Onyx is not assigned too (based on the condition between Ryan and Onyx).
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Thus, the year 1923 must be assigned to Louis (based on the condition between 1921, 1922, and 1923).
  Therefore, Louis and Mollie are assigned, and the remaining two students are selected from Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  Based on the given options, only option D is possible; Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The project requires exactly one student for each of the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned (so they can be responsible for the two consecutive years).
  If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned the year before him (1921 or 1922).
  If Yoshio is not assigned, then there are five students left for four spots, so one and only one of the students will not be assigned.

Analysis:
  Option A is possible because there is no condition that would prevent Louis from being unassigned if there are not enough spots for him, and he is not involved in any other restriction.
  Option B is not possible because Ryan must be assigned when Tiffany is assigned to the project, and Ryan's assignment restricts the possible year for Onyx, so both Ryan and Onyx must be assigned.
  Option C is not possible because if Tiffany is not assigned, then Louis must be assigned to 1923, and there are only four available spots. Thus, at least one person must not be assigned, and that cannot be Tiffany.
  Option D is possible because if Mollie is not assigned to the project, there is no restriction that would prevent Onyx being assigned to 1922.
  Option E is not possible because Louis can only be assigned to either 1921 or 1924, and if Yoshio is unassigned, there are only four available spots. Thus, at least one person must not be assigned, and that cannot be Louis if he is assigned to 1924.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  There are four years in the project: 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  There are six available students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  To assign students, the following conditions must be followed:
    * Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
    * If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
    * If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
    * If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Action: Answer("E")
  
Explanation:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then only five students can be assigned to the project. This means that one of the students will not be assigned to any year. 
  To satisfy the conditions of the problem, the possible assignments are:
  - If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then there is no restriction on the assignments, but only five students can be assigned. Therefore, Louis, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany can be assigned to the years from 1921 to 1924.
  - If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to it. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the conditions of the problem is to assign: Louis to 1923, Mollie to 1921, Onyx to 1922, Ryan to 1924, and Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  - If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned if Tiffany is assigned. In this case, the only way to satisfy the condition of the problem is to assign: Louis to 1924, Mollie to 1922, Onyx to 1921, Ryan to 1923, and Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  - If Mollie is assigned to 1923 or 1924, then there is no way to assign Louis or Tiffany to the year 1923. Therefore, Louis and Tiffany cannot be assigned to any year, and the only way to satisfy the condition of the problem is to assign: Mollie to 1922 or 1921, Onyx to 1921 or 1922, Ryan to 1922 or 1923, and Tiffany is not assigned to the project. 
  In any case, Louis cannot be assigned to any year and the only way to satisfy the conditions is to assign Louis to 1924. Therefore, Louis is assigned to 1924, which means that Louis is not assigned to the project. Answer choice "E" is correct.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  We are looking for a possible scenario given that Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  If Louis or Tiffany is assigned to the project, there is a restriction about their years.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, there is a restriction about her year.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, there is a restriction about Ryan.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, there is a restriction about Onyx.

Reasoning:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be five students available for the project.
  We need to find one scenario that fits all the given conditions.
  If we assign Ryan to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, meaning Onyx must be assigned to 1923.
  We can assign Mollie to 1921, and Louis to 1924.
  Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project as Louis or Tiffany should be assigned to 1923, and both of them are assigned to other years.

Action: Answer("B")  
According to the given conditions, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, Ryan will be in the project, but Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project, so Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, which means he is not assigned to the project. So, B: Ryan is not assigned to the project. is a possible scenario.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  2. Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  3. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  4. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  5. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there are two possible cases:
  Case 1: Mollie is assigned to the project, then she should be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project, therefore Ryan cannot be assigned to the project either. According to condition (5), Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Since Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, neither can Onyx. Louis is not an available candidate for this case, since there will be at least two students (Mollie and Louis) assigned to the project if Mollie is assigned to the project. Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.
  
  Case 2: Mollie is not assigned to the project, which means Tiffany is also not assigned to the project based on Condition (2). This also means Ryan isn't assigned to the project since Condition (4) requires Tiffany to be assigned to the project to assign Ryan. Therefore, Louis and Onyx must be assigned to the project. According to Condition (5), Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1921. Louis can't be assigned to 1923, according to Condition (2), he can only be assigned to 1921, 1922, or 1924. So Louis can be assigned to 1924. 

Possible answers: A, B, and C are impossible based on the two cases above, leaving us with D and E as possible options.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The project requires four students.
  Louis or Tiffany can alone fulfill the requirement for 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must also be assigned.
  If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the immediately preceding year.
  Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  
  A: We still have three students available: Louis, Mollie, and Onyx. However, the project requires four students, so this cannot be true.
  B: Ryan cannot be assigned to the project if Yoshio is not assigned. This cannot be true.
  C: Ryan can only be assigned to the project if Tiffany is assigned, which leaves only Mollie and Onyx as the remaining candidates for the two other years. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be excluded from the project if Yoshio is not assigned. This cannot be true.
  D: Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922 if Yoshio is not assigned, leaving only Louis, Onyx, Ryan and Tiffany as the remaining candidates for the other three years. Ryan cannot be assigned, so Onyx must be assigned to the year prior to 1924, which is 1923. This leaves only Louis and Tiffany as the remaining candidates for the two other years, so it is possible for Onyx to be assigned to 1922 under this circumstance. Thus, this could be true.
  E: This would leave only Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany as the remaining candidates for the three years other than 1923, but we need four students. Therefore, this cannot be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("D")  
If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, neither is Mollie. So, there are only 4 students for four years and each of them could be assigned to a year. We know if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Onyx could be assigned to 1922. The other three years could be assigned to any of the remaining students.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately preceding Ryan's.
  There are 6 students available for project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
Action: Based on the given conditions, we can eliminate choices B and E because of their conflict.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then neither is Mollie since she is one of 4 students to be assigned but has to be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Tiffany has to be assigned to the project. However, only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923 which means Louis has to be assigned to the project and Onyx has to be assigned to 1922. 
  Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, Onyx is assigned to 1922. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The group consists of six students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio.
  Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  
Analysis:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be only five students available for assignment. Since there are four years, every student must be assigned to exactly one year, and one of the years must go unassigned. 
  
A: Louis is not assigned to the project - impossible, since there are only five students available to be assigned to four years. 
B: Ryan is not assigned to the project - possible, but dependent on other assignments and does not necessarily have anything to do with Yoshio not being assigned.
C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project - possible, but Tiffany's assignment is dependent on Ryan being assigned, so this option is unlikely.
D: Onyx is assigned to 1922 - possible, since this assignment does not rely on any other specific student assignment.
E: Louis is assigned to 1924 - impossible, since there are only four years that need to be assigned and Louis and Tiffany cannot be assigned to the same year because only one of them can be assigned to 1923.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The project includes four students and they will be assigned to the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924 with only one student for each year.
- Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
- If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.

Action: 
- If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, the remaining number of students is five.
- Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923, if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, Ryan cannot be assigned as well, since Tiffany assigned to the project is a sufficient condition for Ryan to be assigned. If Ryan is not assigned, then Onyx also cannot be assigned.
- Therefore, eliminating Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx would leave the students Louis, Mollie, and Yoshio. 
- Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922 if she is assigned. Therefore, we can have either Louis, or Yoshio to be assigned to 1923 and, thus, either Mollie or Louis will be assigned to 1924, which does not conflict with any of Yoshio's year options.
- Therefore, A, B, and D are not possible. 
- E, Louis is assigned to 1924, can be possible since Yoshio can be assigned any year except 1924.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order, from first through seventh, in which the realtor shows the houses?
Choices:
  A: K, 0, L, M, N, J, P
  B: N, L, P, K, M, 0, J
  C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J
  D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J
  E: P, 0, K, J, L, N, M
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The first two houses will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Elimination:
  Option A: K cannot be shown in the morning.
  Option B: None of the houses have been shown in the morning.
  Option C: None of the houses have been shown in the morning.
  Option D: None of the houses have been shown in the morning.
  Option E: P cannot be shown in the morning.

Both L and J have specific showing times.
L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. 
Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon.
J must be shown in the evening, which means it is one of the last two houses to be shown.

Option A, B, C, and D fail to meet the above criteria, but Option E meets all the conditions.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The order of the houses shown is as follows: J (evening), first and second houses (morning), third, fourth, and fifth houses (afternoon), and sixth and seventh houses (evening).
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown after K is shown and before M is shown.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  
A: This option shows J in the evening, but it violates the condition that K cannot be shown in the morning.
B: This option violates the condition that J must be shown in the evening.
C: This option violates the condition that J must be shown in the evening.
D: This option shows J in the evening, and it satisfies all the given conditions. 
E: This option violates the condition that K cannot be shown in the morning.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  
Since J cannot be shown until the evening, whatever comes before it must be in the morning or afternoon. And since L must be shown sometime after K and before M, that means L, K, and M cannot all be in the morning, afternoon, or evening together. Therefore, the order must go: morning houses, afternoon houses, then evening houses, with J last. 

A: K is in the morning and the first house to be shown, then J is in the last evening house, but L and M are both in the afternoon, which violates the rule.
B: K is in the afternoon and L is second, then J is in the last evening house, but N and P are both in the morning, which violates the rule.
C: K is in the morning and the first house to be shown, then L is in the afternoon before N and M, but P is still in the morning, which violates the rule.
D: K is in the morning and the last house to be shown, then L is in the afternoon, but all three remaining houses (M, N, and O) are in the evening, which violates the rule.
E: K is in the morning and the second house to be shown, then L is in the afternoon between N and M, then J is in the last evening house, and the remaining houses (O and P) are both in the morning. This order satisfies all the rules.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. J must be shown in the evening. 
  2. K cannot be shown in the morning. 
  3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  4. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  
Elimination:
  - Since J must be shown in the evening, answer choices A, B, and E can be eliminated.
  - K cannot be shown in the morning. Choice C puts K in the morning, so it can be eliminated.
  
Final Answer: 
The only order remaining after elimination is 0, P, M, N, K, L, J. 
So, Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The realtor shows 7 houses J, K, L, M, N, O and P during a day.
  First two houses are shown in the morning, 3rd, 4th and 5th in the afternoon, and 6th and 7th in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
  A: K is shown in the morning, L is shown after K, but before M. N is shown in the afternoon before M. O and P are shown in the evening, but J is supposed to be shown in the evening, so this order is not possible.
  B: N is shown in the afternoon, then L and P are shown. K is shown next in the morning time, followed by M and O in the afternoon. J is shown in the evening as required. This order is possible.
  C: K is shown in the morning followed by O/P. L is shown before M which contradicts the rule that L should be shown after K is shown. N is shown after L so, this option is not correct.
  D: K is shown in the morning followed by O/P. M is shown in the afternoon followed by N. L is not shown in between K and M, so this order is not correct.
  E: P is shown in the evening, K is shown in the morning and J is shown in the evening, but O is between K and J which violates the L must be shown between K and M rule. So, this option is not correct.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, O, and P—during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning. So the houses in the morning will be some of (K, L, M, N, O, P).
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon. So the houses in the afternoon will be some of (K, L, M, N, O, P) excluding the ones chosen in the morning.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. So the houses in the evening will be some of (J, K, L, M, N, O, P) excluding the ones chosen earlier.
  J must be shown in the evening. So the evening houses must contain J.
  K cannot be shown in the morning. So K cannot be one of the morning houses.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
  A: K, 0, L, M, N, J, P
     This order violates that J must be shown in the evening.
  
  B: N, L, P, K, M, 0, J
     This order shows K in the morning which violates the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning.
  
  C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J
     This order satisfies all the given rules and is a possible order in which the realtor shows the houses.
     
  D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J
     This order shows K in the afternoon which violates the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning.
  
  E: P, 0, K, J, L, N, M
     This order violates the rule that J must be shown in the evening.

Action: Answer("C")

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
Action: 
  From the given information, we know that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M. K and O must be published in the fall if K is published in the fall. Since M is being published in the fall, we know from the preceding that K cannot be published in the fall. Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could be published in the fall along with M is (L and O). 
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  2. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

If M is published in the fall:
- N must be published in the spring. 
- Thus, K and O must be published in the fall as they are related. 
- P cannot be published in the fall. 
- L cannot be published in the fall as it does not have a partner related by the conditions. 

So the only pair that could be published in the fall along with M is:
Choice: A: K and O. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
    If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
    M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
    K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
    If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
Choices Analysis:
    A: If K is published in fall, O must also be published in the fall.
    B: If K is published in fall, N must also be published in the fall. Therefore, N cannot be published with M in the fall.
    C: O and M cannot be published together in the fall. 
    D: P cannot be published with M in the fall.
    E: If O is published in fall, K must also be published in the fall, but K cannot be published with M.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
- M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
- K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
- If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
- If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

Analysis:
- If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring.
- That means K, N, and O must be published in the spring, and L, M, and P must be published in the fall.
- Since we are looking for a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M, then the answer must include only L or P.
- The only answer that satisfies these conditions is C: L and O.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. M is published in the fall.
  2. M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  3. K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  4. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  5. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  
Using the 3rd and 5th conditions, since M is published in the fall and N must be published in the spring, K and O must be published in the fall. Therefore, we have two pairs of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M: 
  - K and O
  - L and P

Answers A, B, C, and D are not possible because they do not include M along with either K or O. 
Answer E is not possible because P cannot be published in the same season as M. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, so N cannot be published in the fall with M. Since M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other, P cannot be published in the fall with M. If O is published in the fall, then K must also be published in the fall, so K and O must both be published in the fall with M. Therefore, the answer is A: K and O. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The cookbooks K and N must be published in the same season.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
Action: 
If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall. If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall, and therefore K, M and O will be published in the fall. If K is published in the spring, then N must be published in the fall with M. Therefore, if M is published in the fall, only K and O can be published in the fall with M.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The cookbooks are K, L, M, N, O, and P
  M and P cannot be published in the same season
  K and N must be published in the same season
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall. 
  If M is published in the fall, then P must be published in the spring. Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall if M is published in the fall.
  If O is published in the fall, then K must also be published in the fall.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.

Eliminating Options:
- N cannot be published in the fall if M is published in the fall
- If P is published in the spring, M cannot be published in the spring. 
- If O is published in the fall, then K must also be published in the fall. 

Possible pairs: 
- K and O can be published in the fall if M is published in the fall
- L and 0 can be published in the fall if M is published in the fall

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  1. M and P cannot be published in the same season
  2. K and N must be published in the same season
  3. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall
  4. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
  
Using 1. If M is published in the fall, then P must be published in the spring. Therefore P cannot be a candidate for books to be published in the fall with M.

Using 4. If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore N cannot be a candidate for books to be published in the fall with M.

According to 2, if N is not in the fall, then  K would not be in the fall either.

According to 3, if K is not in the fall, then O would not be in the fall either.

Therefore, we have the following available cookbooks for the candidates. 
- K, 0, L for fall
- None of the cookbooks are left for the candidates of the spring.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H
  - P is performed at some time before S
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O
  - If S is performed fourth, there are two possible orders: O is played first and T is played second or R is played first and F is played second.
 
Eliminating answer choices:
  - A: P cannot be played before S if S is played fourth. Eliminated.
  - B: H cannot be the eighth composition performed. Eliminated.
  - C: O is played first, but P cannot be played before S if S is played fourth. Eliminated.
  - D: This could be a possible list of compositions played first, second, and third respectively, if O is played first. 
  - E: If S is played fourth, O must either be first or fifth, so this answer is eliminated.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The order of the compositions must satisfy the following conditions:
  -T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  -At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  -O is performed either first or fifth.
  -The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  -P is performed at some time before S.
  -At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

Since S is performed fourth and at least one composition is performed before S, we know that O must be performed first. Therefore, choice C and D are the only possible options since they both have O as the first composition performed.

If O is performed first, then either L or H is performed eighth. If L is performed eighth, then T is performed immediately before F, and the remaining compositions can only be H, P, R, and S, which cannot be ordered according to the given conditions. Therefore, L cannot be performed last, and H must be performed last. This means that T must be performed immediately before F. If we place P next to S in the order, then the remaining compositions can only be F, R, and one of L or T. Since there must be at least two compositions between F and R or R and F, L or T must be performed before R, and the other must be performed after F. Therefore, the order must be O, P, T, F, L, R, S, H

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
To check whether S can be performed fourth, we need to determine the possible positions of O, L/H, and P, if S is already at the fourth position.

If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed first, second, and third must meet the condition of 'At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O'. That means either O is first or O is fifth.

Case 1: O is first and S is fourth. Then, L/H must be the eighth composition. The order of the compositions performed is 'O, P, R, S, F, T, H/L, and then finally the remaining composition. Since we know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, we can rule out A, B, and E. Of the two remaining choices, D is possible since O, P, and T can be performed consecutively.

Case 2: O is fifth and S is fourth. Then, either L or H must be the first. The order of the compositions performed is 'L/H, R, F, S, O, P, and then the remaining composition. Since we know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, we can rule out A and E. C can be a possible order since O is performed fifth and P, R, and T can be performed consecutively.

Therefore, the answer must be either C or D.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The compositions to be performed are F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

Since S is performed fourth, we know that it must be that O is performed first or fifth, because there is at least one composition played either before O or after S. Then, based on the available options, the only possibility is that O is played first and P is played second, because the order of the compositions must satisfy the conditions. This eliminates options A and E. We also know that the eighth composition played is either L or H, so option B can be eliminated, since neither L nor H are included in the list. So the only possibility for an accurate list of compositions performed first, second, and third are the compositions O, P, and T respectively, which is option D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The order of the compositions to be performed at the concert must satisfy the following conditions:
  1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  3. O is performed either first or fifth.
  4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  5. P is performed at some time before S.
  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, P must be performed before S.
  O must be performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, P will be performed after O. If O is performed fifth, P can be performed either before O or after S.
  As per the given choices: 
    A: If F is performed after S, then T must be performed immediately after R or immediately before F which violates the given conditions.
    B: If H is the last composition then O cannot be performed first and also P must be performed before H which violates the conditions.
    C: This could be a possible sequence. If O is the first composition then P can be performed after O and R could be the last composition performed.
    D: If T is performed last, then either F must be performed immediately before T or R must performed immediately after T which violates the conditions.
    E: If T is performed last, then either F must be performed immediately before T or R must performed immediately after T which violates the conditions.
    
  Option C could be a possible sequence.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The order of performance needs to meet the following conditions:
  1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  3. O is performed either first or fifth.
  4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  5. P is performed at some time before S.
  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  The question asks about an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, given that S is performed fourth.
  
  If S is performed fourth, the only possibilities for the first three compositions are O, P, R or L, P, R. F cannot be first because it must be preceded or followed by T, and T cannot be fourth. H is not one of the first three, so it cannot be paired with P. This rules out A and B. C is also wrong because O cannot be followed by P as there must be at least one composition between them. This leaves us with D and E to consider.
  
  If O is the first composition, it is not possible for P to be the second composition since P must be performed before S, which is fourth. Therefore, the first three compositions would be O, P, and T. This satisfies condition 1 but does not satisfy condition 4 since we do not know whether the eighth composition is L or H. Hence D can be eliminated.

  Therefore, the correct answer is E, which shows the first three compositions as P, R, T, and satisfies all of the given conditions.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - 8 compositions - F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time.
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
If S is performed fourth, then it means the compositions that would have been performed before S could only be any of O, F, R, H, L or T. Since O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed before S, then composition O has to be in the first three performances. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect since O cannot be performed fifth. 
In option A, P is performed before H, which is not allowed. Option E does not conform to the condition that at least two compositions should be performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F since no composition is performed between P and T. The only option left is option D, which conforms to all the conditions: O performed first, followed by P and then T.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - The order of the performance must satisfy the given conditions.
  - If S is performed fourth, it means that the compositions before it are in position 1, 2 and 3.
  - The eighth composition to be performed is either L or H.
  
Analysis:
  - Using the condition given, we have the following possibilities for the 8th composition: L or H
  - According to the given condition, O should be performed either first or fifth. So we have the following possibilities:
      - O - - - -
      - - - - O -
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - If S is performed fourth, then O cannot be performed first. Hence we have the possibility:
      - - P - S -
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. 
  - Using the given conditions above, we can rule out options A, B, D and E as they do not comply with all the given conditions.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  We can use the elimination method to solve this question and identify the only possible answer for the order of compositions if S is performed fourth.
  
Elimination:
- A: F, H, P
  - P is performed before S, which cannot be the case if S is performed fourth. 
- B: H, P. L
  - P is performed before S, which cannot be the case if S is performed fourth.
- C: O, P, R
  - P is performed before S, which cannot be the case if S is performed fourth.
- D: O, P, T
  - T must be sequentially next to F or R, which cannot be the case if O is performed first.
- E: P, R, T
  - Fits all the conditions described.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S. 
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  We need to test each answer choice by applying the rules to make sure it does not contradict them.
  
Analysis:
  If S is performed fourth,
  - from the rule:  P is performed at some time before S. 
  it follows that P must be performed first, second or third.
  - from the rule: O is performed either first or fifth.
  the only possibility for the first composition is O.
  - from the rule: The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  we do not know the order of L and H yet. We will assume L is the eighth composition.
  - from the rule: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  if T appears in the list before F and R (options D and E), then there is no possible order to satisfy this condition, so they are eliminated.
  If T appears after F or R, then we also have to have either F or R having all the compositions between it and T in order to satisfy the condition. This leaves us with two possibilities for the F and R positions:
  -
  F _ _ _ T _ _ L
  R _ _ _ T _ _ L
  
  Now we need to consider the remaining rules:
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  if F is fourth, then we have no room for two compositions between F and R. So F must be  first and R must be fifth.
  O P _ _ S _ _ L
  H/T !F R

Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are six bays numbered consecutively from 1 to 6.
  - There are exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, which means they are in bays 3 and 4 in some order.
  - Bay 4 is either the bay for textiles or produce.
  
Evaluation:
  - Choice A is possible as it can be in one of the bays 5 or 6.
  - Choice B is possible as it can be in one of the bays 1, 2, or 3.
  - Choice C is possible as it can be in one of the bays 1, 2 or 3.
  - Choice D is not possible as it needs to have a higher number than the fuel that must be in bay 1 or 2.
  - Choice E is possible as it can be in bay 4 with the other neighboring bay having the produce in bay 3.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds one of the six cargo types.
  Bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  Bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  Bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Six types of cargo are:
    - Fuel
    - Grain
    - Livestock
    - Machinery
    - Produce
    - Textiles
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds a type of cargo that is next to textiles yet not produce, so it must be either fuel, grain, or machinery.
  Bay 4 cannot hold produce. 
  Bay 5 must hold fuel.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  Bay 6 cannot hold textile.
  If bay 4 held grain, then bay 5 would have to hold machinery, but machinery can only be in a lower-numbered bay than both grain and produce.
  If bay 4 held livestock or machinery, then the cargo in bay 3 would have to be grain, which would contradict the second rule.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Bay 1 holds either Textiles or Produce.
  Bay 2 holds a type of cargo that is higher than Fuel.
  If Bay 3 holds Textiles, then Bay 4 holds Produce; otherwise, Bay 4 holds Textiles.
  Bay 5 holds a type of cargo that is higher than Livestock.
  Bay 6 holds a type of cargo that is not Textiles.
  A: Grain must be held in bay 6 because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. 
  B: Livestock could be held in bay 3 or 4 because the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles and a lower number than the bay holding grain. 
  C: Machinery could be held in any bay because the prompt only mentions cargo types that must be above or below each other in a few situations. 
  D: Produce can only be held in bay 1 or 2 because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. 
  E: Textiles can only be held in bay 3 or 5 because the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  We know that there are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce and textiles
  and six bays: bay 1, bay 2, bay 3, bay 4, bay 5, bay 6. 
  We also know that:
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  This means that the bay holding fuel must be bay 1, 2, or 3.
  The bay holding produce must be bay 5 or 6 and would have to be bay 6 to be next to textiles.
  Textiles therefore would have to be in bay 4 or bay 5. But textiles cannot be in bay 5 because in this case produce will not be next to textiles. 
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The order of bays and types of cargo is as follows:
   - Bay 1: fuel or produce
   - Bay 2: livestock
   - Bay 3: fuel or produce
   - Bay 4: 
   - Bay 5: grain
   - Bay 6: machinery
   
  The bay holding grain is Bay 5.
  Textiles are not in Bay 1 or 6, which means it must be in Bay 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  If textiles is in Bay 2 or 4, produce must be in the other of those two bays.
  Since produce has a higher number than fuel and it's next to textiles, then fuel must be in Bay 1 or Bay 3.
  Therefore, machinery must be in Bay 6.
  
  A: Bay 5 is holding Grain.
  B: Livestock is in Bay 2, which is lower than Bay 4.
  C: Machinery is in Bay 6.
  D: Produce is in Bay 3 or 2, which is higher than Bay 4.
  E: Textiles can be held in Bay 2 or 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. There are six bays in total, numbered 1 through 6.
  2. There are six types of cargo, including fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  3. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  4. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  5. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  6. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analysis:
  We need to find which type of cargo CANNOT be held in bay 4. According to the given information, bay 4 is adjacent to the bay holding textiles, which means it holds either produce or textiles. Therefore, we can eliminate options D and E.
  We know that bay holding produce is higher than the bay holding fuel, and bay holding livestock is higher than bay holding textiles. Since bay 4 lies between bay holding textile and bay holding machinery (high chance), and options A, B, and C have no hierarchy relationship, the type of cargo held in bay 4 could be any of the three. Therefore none of the given options could not be held in bay 4. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Bay 1 has to hold one of the types of cargo -- grain, livestock, or textiles. 
  Bay 6 has to hold produce. 
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  So either bay 3 or bay 4 holds fuel. 
  Textiles is next to the produce, so either bay 3 or bay 5 holds textiles.
  Bay holding livestock is higher numbered than the one holding textiles. 
  Bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  A is impossible since it's higher than livestock.
  B is possible since the first bay can hold grain.
  C is possible since we don't know anything about its position.
  D is possible since it could come before fuel.
  E is possible since it could come before produce.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other, holding each a different one of exactly six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
Analyzing each option:
  - A: It is possible that the bay holding grain is bay 5 and livestock is bay 3.
  - B: It is possible that the bay holding livestock is bay 3 and textiles is bay 1.
  - C: It is possible, for example, that machinery is bay 4, if fuel is bay 2, for example.
  - D: It is possible that the bay holding produce is bay 1, textiles is bay 2 and grain is bay 5.
  - E: It is possible that the bay holding textiles is bay 2 and produce is bay 3.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")  
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 bays consecutively numbered 1 - 6.
  - There are exactly 6 types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

  We need to eliminate one of the cargos from being held in Bay 4 based on the given information.

  A: grain cannot be held in Bay 4 since the bay holding grain has higher number than the one holding livestock.
  B: livestock cannot be held in Bay 4, the bay holding livestock has a lower number than the one holding livestock.
  C: machinery can be held in Bay 4 since there is no condition or relationship with other bays.
  D: produce cannot be held in Bay 4 since the bay holding produce has a higher number than the one holding fuel.
  E: textiles cannot be held in Bay 4 since the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Each of the four art students - Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, Isaacs - has two paintings: one oil and one watercolor
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls (walls 1, 2, 3, and 4) in an upper and a lower position
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it
  - No wall has only one student's work displayed on it
  - On any given wall, Franz's and Isaacs's works do not both appear together
  - Greene's watercolor is on the upper position of the wall with Franz's oil
  - Isaacs's oil is on the lower position of wall 4
  
Action: Answer("D") 

Assuming that wall 1 contains Franz's paintings (one oil and one watercolor), and that wall 4 contains Isaacs's oil (in the lower position), then Hidalgo must be the only artist whose work could decorate wall 4 with Isaacs's oil painting. Furthermore, since no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, it means that Franz's watercolor must be displayed on a wall other than wall 4. This leaves us with only wall 2 and wall 3 as possible options for displaying Franz's watercolor. 

Thus, on wall 2 or wall 3, we know that Greene's oil painting is in the upper position, and Franz's watercolor is in either the upper (if wall 2) or lower (if wall 3) position. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil painting must be on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor painting, which means that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.

Therefore, the answer is D.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  We know that:
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene’s watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz’s oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs’s oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  We have to determine which one of our options must be true if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor.

  A: There is no clear connection between Franz's watercolor and Greene's oil. This does not have to be true.

  B: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, and no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, then Hidalgo’s oil must be on a different wall with either Isaacs’s oil or watercolor.

  C: If Hidalgo’s oil is displayed in an upper position, and his or her watercolor is not on the same wall as Isaacs’s watercolor, there would only be one possibility for where that watercolor could go, and this would lead to both of these conditions being violated: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this cannot be true.

  D: If Hidalgo’s oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs’s watercolor, there would be only one possibility for what goes on the other two walls, and this would lead to both of these conditions being violated: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this cannot be true.

  E: Wall 4 already has Isaacs’s oil in the lower position so, if Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in the same wall as Greene's oil, it must be in the upper position.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Four students display exactly two paintings: an oil and a watercolor; this results in a total of 8 paintings on display. 
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the four walls, 1 to 4.
  No wall can have only watercolors.
  No wall can display the work of only one student.
  Franz and Isaacs cannot be on the same wall.
  Greene's watercolor is above Franz's oil on the wall where Franz displays his oil.
  Isaacs's oil is in the lower position on wall 4.

Action: Given that of these statements - Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true? 
  If Greene's watercolor is already used to fulfill the condition that Franz's oil is below it, it implies that Greene's oil must be on the opposite side of the wall as Franz's watercolor. So we know that Franz's watercolor is on the wall opposite Green's oil. Also, since each student can't appear on the same wall twice, we can assume that Greene appears on the wall that neither Franz nor Isaacs are on.
  Hidalgo's watercolor appearing on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor will go against the given information of "No wall has only watercolors displayed on it."
  Given that Hidalgo does not appear on the wall with Isaacs, we can assume that Hidalgo appears on the same wall as Greene. If Hidalgo appeared on the same wall as Isaacs then no wall would be left for the remaining two paintings. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil would be in the upper position since their watercolor cannot be in the upper position due to Greene's watercolor being there.
  Isaacs's watercolor is in the upper position since we know that their oil is in the lower position on Wall 4.
Answer:  Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - In the exhibition room, there are four walls, each with two paintings (an oil and a watercolor) displayed on it, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors; thus, each wall has at least one oil.
  - No wall has the work of only one student; thus, each wall has works of at least two students.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, the only possible wall for that to happen is wall 4. Thus, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on walls 1, 2, or 3. However, since no wall can have only watercolors, Hidalgo must have an oil and a watercolor on the same wall, let's say wall 1. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor (the only work that Isaacs has left) must be displayed on wall 3. Hence, Hidalgo's oil and Isaacs's watercolor are displayed on the same wall (wall 1). Thus, the correct answer is D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs are four art students who will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
- Two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
- Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Action: Answer("E")

If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall because no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. So, Greene's watercolor is displayed on one of the other 3 walls. According to the second condition, no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, which implies that Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's paintings. 
Moreover, Hidalgo's two paintings cannot be on the same wall with Isaacs's two paintings because of the third condition. Therefore, Hidalgo's two paintings are on one of the other 2 walls. Finally, according to the first condition, no wall has only watercolors displayed on it; thus, Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on a different wall than the wall where his oil is displayed. Hence, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position. Therefore, the answer is E, Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - Each wall has two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then that wall must have:
   - Greene's oil and watercolor
   - Franz's oil and watercolor
   
  Since Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4, neither his watercolor nor his oil can be on the same wall as Greene's oil. Also, Franz's and Isaacs's paintings cannot be on the same wall. This limits the choices to walls 1 and 2.

  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or 2, which contradicts the initial condition.

Actions: 
  The only possibility left is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. Therefore, the answer is (D) Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Analysis:
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then all the remaining paintings by Greene and Franz (i.e., Greene's watercolor and Franz's oil) must be displayed on another wall together.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo and Isaacs paintings must be displayed on the remaining two walls. And since no wall has only watercolors, Hidalgo and Issacs must display an oil painting each on their respective walls.
  - According to the given conditions, the oil painting by Isaacs must be displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 4 walls and each wall displays 2 paintings.
  - Each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
To solve the problem, let's see what we know:
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that:
  	1. Franz's watercolor must be displayed in a lower position on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  	2. The wall with Franz's watercolor and Greene's oil must have one more painting with one of the remaining two students in the upper and lower positions.
  	3. Isaacs's oil is on wall 4, thus it cannot be on the same wall as Franz's watercolor.
  	4. Hidalgo has not been used in the first three walls.
  
From this, we can conclude that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in upper position on the same wall as Franz's watercolor. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:  
  There are four art students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs.
  Each student will display two paintings (an oil and a watercolor), so there will be eight paintings in total. 
  Each wall will have exactly two paintings (one in the upper position and one in the lower position), and no wall will have only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. 
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

We know that Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs each have an oil and a watercolor painting displayed. Since Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know Greene's watercolor is displayed on another wall. Also, since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, that means that Franz's watercolor is displayed in the lower position of that same wall. 

Knowledge:
  Since each wall displays exactly two paintings and no wall has the work of only one student, there must be at least two students represented on each wall. 
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.

Using the information above, we can do some deduction: 
  * Wall 1 cannot have a painting by Isaacs, and it cannot have a painting by Franz. This means that both Hidalgo's paintings must be on Wall 1, but we don't know the positions yet.
  * Wall 2 has at least two students. Since Wall 2 cannot have a painting by Franz, then Greene and Hidalgo must have a painting each on Wall 2. Therefore, Isaacs' paintings must not be on Wall 2.
  * Wall 3 cannot have a painting by Franz, so at least one of Isaacs' paintings must be on Wall 3. We don't know the second painting yet.
  * We already know that Wall 4 has Isaacs' oil in the lower position. Therefore, Greene's watercolor must be on Wall 4 in the upper position.
  
Using the information above, we can determine the following must be true:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. --> Not necessarily true. We don't have information on where Greene's oil is displayed.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. --> Not necessarily true. We know nothing about the position or placement of Hidalgo's paintings.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position. --> Not necessarily true. We don't have information on where Hidalgo's paintings are displayed.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor. --> Not necessarily true. From the deduction above, we know one of Isaacs' paintings is on Wall 3, but we don't know what the second painting on that wall is yet.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position. --> Must be true based on the information given in the question since we already know Isaacs' oil is displayed in the lower position on Wall 4. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Four students will display two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Wall 4 has Isaacs's oil in its lower position.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  
Analysis:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then wall 1 or wall 2 will have both the paintings from Franz and Greene.
  Wall 1 or Wall 2 can't have both the paintings from Franz and Isaacs so Franz must be on either wall 3 or wall 4 and since Greene's watercolor is in the upper position of that wall, it can only be wall 3.
  Now, Hidalgo can be placed on either wall 1 or wall 2 but looking at all the choices, only choice E is necessarily true.

Knowledge:
  The shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a row.
  Seven business are located in order: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  Constraints are:
    - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
    - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
    - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
    - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store implies that the order looks like this [OC][PS][R][R][SS][TS][V] or [CO][SP][R][R][SS][TS][V].
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The optometrist must be next to the pharmacy or veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then they cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy is at one end of the row and one of the restaurants is at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - There are exactly two restaurants.
  
To satisfy the constraints, the pharmacy can only be in space 1 or space 7, and one of the restaurants is in space 1 or space 7. 
  
  If the pharmacy is in space 1 and a restaurant is in space 7, then the optometrist and the veterinarian must be located next to each other, which violates the constraints.
  If the pharmacy is in space 7 and a restaurant is in space 1, then the optometrist and the veterinarian must be located next to each other, which also violates the constraints.
  Therefore, restaurant should be in space 2, 3, 5, or 6 and the pharmacy in space 1 or 7.

If optometrist is next to the shoe store, then there are two possible configurations:
  - Optometrist -> Shoe store -> [Pharmacy in space 1 / 7] -> Business A -> Restaurant -> Business B -> Veterinarian: Here, Business A and Business B can only be the toy store and the other restaurant (in some order). Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  - [Pharmacy in space 1 / 7] -> Business A -> Restaurant -> Business B -> Optometrist -> Shoe store -> Veterinarian: Here, Business A and Business B are the two restaurants (in some order). Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair are the two restaurants.
  
Option C is incorrect because it does not contain the optometrist and the shoe store.
Option D is incorrect because it does not satisfy the constraints.
Option E is incorrect because it suggests the veterinarian is next to the shoe store, which violates the constraints.
Therefore, the answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The optometrist and the shoe store are located next to each other in the row.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  The pharmacy is located at one end of the row and next to the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  One of the restaurants is located at the other end of the row.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The optometrist is next to the shoe store
  - The pharmacy is next to the optometrist or the veterinarian
  - The toy store is not next to the veterinarian
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses
  
Thinking process:
We have the optometrist and the shoe store together; so the following arrangement is possible O-S-x-x-x-x-x or x-x-x-x-x-S-O. According to the constraints, the pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other end. Thus, we can have two possibilities:
1. O-S-x-x-x-x-V/P - Where V is the veterinarian and P is the pharmacy. Then, the two restaurants has to be placed such that the second restaurant is separated from the first restaurant by at least two businesses: [R1, x, x, x, R2]
2. V/P-x-x-x-x-S-O, Then, the two restaurants has to be placed such that the second restaurant is separated from the first restaurant by at least two businesses: [R2, x, x, x, R1]

Thus, if the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be a pharmacy and either a veterinarian (if the string is O-S-P-V-x-x-x) or a second restaurant (if the string is V/P-x-x-x-x-S-O) out of the given choices.
Therefore the answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  There are 7 shops in a straight row - 1 to 7.
  7 types of businesses - optometrist, pharmacy, 2 restaurants, shoe store, toy store, veterinarian.
  Constraints:
    - Pharmacy at one end and one of the restaurants at the other. 
    - Pharmacy must be either next to optometrist or veterinarian.
    - Two restaurants must be separated by two other businesses.
    - Toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Action: Answer("B") 
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store and the pharmacy is at one end then according to the constraints mentioned:
- restaurant must be at the other end.
- there must be a veterinarian or optometrist next to the pharmacy and as the restaurant is at the other end, optometrist must be next to the pharmacy.
- the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so from restaurant's end, next is toy store then a business and then the optometrist. The pharmacy is far away from this, so there is only one possibility that the pharmacy must be next to the toy store.
Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store, so the answer is B.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The shopping center has seven spaces arranged in a straight row, and seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the shoe store must be surrounded by the following neighbors: either (1) the optometrist and a restaurant or (2) the veterinarian and a restaurant. 

Action: Answer("A")  
The optometrist cannot be located at the end of the row, according to the given constraints. So, it must be in one of the spaces between space 2 and space 6. If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the shoe store must be surrounded by the optometrist and a restaurant. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are the pharmacy and a restaurant. 
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  5. The optometrist is next to the shoe store.
  
Analysis: 
  From note #5, the optometrist and the shoe store are neighbors. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian (note #3) and the pharmacy must be at one end of the row or at the other end (note #1), it follows that the optometrist must be at the end opposite to the pharmacy. Now, either the veterinarian is next to the optometrist or he is not. If he is not next to the optometrist, he must be next to the restaurant. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses (note #2), it follows that one of the restaurants must be next to the optometrist and the other next to the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian (note #4), it follows that the toy store must be in one of the two positions adjacent to the pharmacy. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe-store pair must be the pharmacy and the toy store. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Seven businesses must be laid out. The pharmacy and one of the restaurants are fixed at either side of the row. 
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - We know that optometrist is next to the shoe store and there are only seven spaces.

Action: Answer("D") 
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then 1 or 7 are occupied by the pharmacy or the restaurant. Also, the other restaurant cannot be next to this pair. Therefore, the other restaurant must be in either 3rd or 5th position. 
If the pharmacy is on the left side, then the toy store is on the right side with the veterinarian. Therefore, the immediate business on the either side of optometrist and shoe store toy store and restaurant. 
If the pharmacy is on the right side, then the toy store is on the left side with the veterinarian. In this scenario, again the immediate business on the either side of optometrist and shoe store are toy store and restaurant.
Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store are a restaurant and the toy store, and the answer is (D).
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces in the shopping center arranged in a straight row, labeled 1 through 7.
  - Seven businesses will be located in the center, one per space: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants must be at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least 2 other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
Action:
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, they must occupy spaces 2 and 3 in some order.
  - The pharmacy can only be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it must be in space 1 or space 4.
  - One of the restaurants must be at the opposite end of the row from the pharmacy, so it must occupy space 7.
  - The other restaurant cannot be in spaces 2, 3, 4, or 6, since those spaces are adjacent to other businesses that have already been placed. Therefore, it must occupy space 5.
  - This leaves spaces 2 and 3 for the shoe store and optometrist, and spaces 6 and 7 for the veterinarian and the restaurant, respectively.
  - Thus, the answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant. The pharmacy must occupy space 1 or 4, and the restaurant must occupy space 7.
  
Therefore, Answer("A") is correct.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses on either side of this pair must be the pharmacy and the toy store. According to the constraint, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, but since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and the only place to put the pharmacy is in the space next to the optometrist. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the only place to put the toy store is in the space next to the shoe store, which means that the businesses immediately on either side of this pair are the pharmacy and the toy store. Therefore, the answer is B.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Three batches of each type of cookie are made each week, from Monday to Friday.
  - Each batch of cookies is made on a single day and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then it is clear that at least one of the types of cookies will not be made on Friday.
 
Analysis: 
  - From the given conditions, there are only two batches of sugar cookies, and the second batch is made on Thursday, so no batch of sugar cookies can be made on Friday.
  - Similarly, there are only two batches of oatmeal cookies, and the second batch is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies and the second batch of oatmeal cookies will always be made on the same day. So if the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, that means the second batch of peanut butter cookies will also be made on Friday, but only one batch is made on Friday. That means the third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday.
  - Therefore we can eliminate options C and E.

Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  - If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then two batches of sugar cookies can be made on the remaining days of the week. This allows for one batch of oatmeal and one batch of peanut butter cookies to be made each on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. This means that on Friday, only one batch of cookies will be made, which satisfies the given condition.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar, with exactly three batches of each kind of cookie made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one:
    - Then there must be a total of 8 batches made from Monday through Friday. (3 batches of each type of cookie and one batch on Friday)
    - The first batch of sugar cookies is not made on Monday (from the given information)
    - The second batch of sugar cookies is not made on Friday (from the given information)
    - There can only be one batch made on Friday.
      - If the third oatmeal batch is made on Friday, then the first oatmeal batch must be made on Monday (to satisfy the condition that no other oatmeal batch is made on the same day).
        - Therefore the first peanut batch would have to be made on Tuesday, and the second peanut batch would have to be made on Wednesday.
        - However, this violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day.
      - If the first oatmeal batch is made on Tuesday, then the first peanut batch must be on Monday (to satisfy the condition that no other peanut batch is made on the same day).
        - Therefore the second peanut batch would be made on Thursday, and the second oatmeal and sugar batches are made on Wednesday.
        - This satisfies all the given conditions.
          
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Analysis:
  If only one batch is made on Friday, two batches must be made on some other day and three batches must be made on another day.
  At least one of the batches made on Monday is not an oatmeal or a peanut butter cookie.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so they must be made on different days, but the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. So, second batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookie can only be made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, no more batches of sugar cookies can be made.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the third batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Friday.
 
Action: Answer("C")

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, there are two possible schedules that satisfy the conditions:

Thu: oatmeal 3, peanut butter 2, sugar 1
Fri: oatmeal 2, peanut butter 3, sugar 2

Only schedule 2 satisfies Choices B, C, and E.

Choice A is not possible because the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, not Monday. 
Choice D is not possible because the first peanut butter cookies are made on Monday or Thursday, not Wednesday.

Action: Answer("B, C, E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  * There are three kinds of cookie: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  * Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  * Each batch is made, start to finish, on a single day.
  * No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  * At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  * The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  * The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are only two possibilities that allow each type of cookie to be made three times and follow the given conditions: the batches on Friday are PB, O, S (in that order), or the batches on Friday are PB, S, O (in that order). In either case, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday so that the second batch is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Thus, B is the only option that could be true.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  In this problem, we have three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  We have three batches of each kind of cookie being made each week.
  Each batch has to be made on a different day of the week.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  We know at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because we know at least one batch is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal are made on Friday, therefore the first batch must be made on Monday or Wednesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because all three batches of each kind of cookie are already made from Monday to Thursday.
  D: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, which would violate a previous condition. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cannot be made on Wednesday.
  E: If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, this could be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 3 types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - There are 3 batches of each type of cookie each week.
  - Each batch is made on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  If only one batch of cookies is made on Friday, then the other 8 batches must have been baked on Monday through Thursday. Since there are no repeated batches on the same day and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the third batch of sugar cookies must have been baked on Friday. 
  It follows that the first and second batches of sugar cookies were baked on Monday and Tuesday, in some order. 
  There are only three batches remaining to be baked on Monday through Thursday: the first and third batches of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
  Because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and no two batches of the same flavor can be made on the same day, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Wednesday. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. 
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- There are always three batches of each kind of cookie made each week, for a total of 9 batches.
- No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
- At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
- If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the other four weekdays (Monday through Thursday) must have two batches each.
- A: The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because there must be at least one batch made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day.
- B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because there must be at least one batch made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day.
- C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because if the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the other four weekdays (Monday through Thursday) must have two batches each.
- D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because if the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then the remaining three batches (one oatmeal, one peanut butter, and one sugar) must be made on the three remaining days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday). Thus, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday, not Wednesday.
- E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Tuesday. If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, which means the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. On Wednesday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made, leaving one batch of peanut butter cookies to be made on Friday.

Action: Answer("E")

Analysis:
  - If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there can only be two scenarios:
    1. One batch of oatmeal cookies, one batch of peanut butter cookies, and one batch of sugar cookies were made on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively. On Thursday, a batch of sugar cookies and a batch of oatmeal cookies were made. On Friday, only one batch of peanut butter cookies was made.
    2. One batch of oatmeal cookies, one batch of peanut butter cookies, and one batch of sugar cookies were made on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively. On Thursday, a batch of oatmeal cookies and a batch of sugar cookies were made. On Friday, only one batch of peanut butter cookies was made.

Solution:
  - A: The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because only oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies are made on Monday.
  - B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies could not be made on Tuesday because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Also, the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday since the oatmeal cookies are made on Monday and Thursday. Only one batch of oatmeal cookies is produced each day.
  - D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because oatmeal cookies are made on Monday and Wednesday.

Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?
Choices:
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
  C: the sci-fi film, the western
  D: the western, the horror film
  E: the western, the mystery
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are three screens in the repertory theater, with two movies playing on Screens 1 and 2 and one movie playing on Screen 3.
  The schedule for the movies has the Western starting before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on Screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on Screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are on different screens.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  The movie playing on Screen 2 needs to start at 7 PM. 
  The romance is not shown on Screen 2, so it leaves the horror and the mystery movies to be played on Screen 2.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on Screen 3, therefore it should be played on Screen 1 or Screen 2.
  The western should be played before the horror film and C is the only option where the western is played after the sci-fi film on Screen 2. Thus, it CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown in screen 3.
  The romance is not shown in screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  
Eliminating options:
  The mystery and the horror film must be shown in screens 1 and 2, though we don't know which is shown on which screen or time.
  Romance is not shown in Screen 2 or time.
  Sci-fi should not be in Screen 3.
  From the western and horror film, the western should play first.

Check for valid options:
  A) The sci-fi movie is in the same list as the horror film which contradicts the given conditions.
  B) Possible
  C) The sci-fi film is played in Screen 2 which contradicts the given conditions.
  D) Possible
  E) The mystery should be played with the horror film which contradicts the given conditions. 

Action: Answer("A") - The option "A" cannot be an accurate list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does
  Romance is not shown on screen 2
  Horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  Screen 1 and Screen 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.

  There are five movies- horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie at 8 PM.
  Screen 1 and Screen 2 each show two movies at 7 PM and 9 PM.

Reasoning:
  From the given conditions, we can deduce that:
  - Screen 3 can only show the romance, mystery, sci-fi or the western movie.
  - The horror movie cannot be shown at 7 PM because its start time is later than the western movie.
  - There are only two slots at 7 PM, and the romance movie is not shown on screen 2.
  - Sci-fi movie is not shown on screen 3 

  For option A, it is possible that the sci-fi movie is shown on screen 2 at 7 PM, and the horror movie is shown on the same screen at 9 PM.
  For option B, it is possible that the sci-fi movie is shown on screen 2 at 7 PM, and the mystery movie is shown on the same screen at 9 PM.
  For option C, it is not possible as the sci-fi movie cannot be shown on screen 3
  For option D, it is possible that the western movie is shown on screen 2 at 7 PM, and the horror movie is shown on the same screen at 9 PM.
  For option E, it is possible that the western movie is shown on screen 2 at 7 PM, and the mystery movie is shown on the same screen at 9 PM.

Action: Answer("C")  - the sci-fi film, the western

  A: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, thus, this combination is not possible.
  B: The horror film and the mystery should be shown on different screens, thus this combination is not possible.
  C: This combination is possible since the western can start at 7 PM on screen 2, followed by the sci-fi film.
  D: This combination is possible since the western can start at 7 PM on screen 2 and the horror film can start at 9 PM on screen 2.
  E: This combination is possible since the western can start at 7 PM on screen 2 and the mystery can start at 9 PM on the same screen.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are five movies showing at the theater: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western.
  Each movie is shown once, on either screens 1, 2, or 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Analysis: 
  We know that the romance is not on screen 2, the sci-fi film is not on screen 3, and the horror and mystery films are on different screens. 
  Let's analyze each choice:
  A: The western film would have to be shown on screen 1 for it to be shown before the horror film, so this choice is not possible. 
  B: This choice is possible. The sci-fi film is shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. followed by the mystery.  
  C: This choice is not possible. The western film would have to be shown on screen 1 for it to be shown before the horror film, but the western can't be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. since that screen is already showing two movies at 7 P.M. 
  D: This choice is not possible. If the western is shown at 7 P.M., it cannot be followed by the horror film at 9 P.M. since the western must end before the horror film begins. 
  E: This choice is possible. The western film is shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M. followed by the mystery film at 9 P.M.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The western movie must start before the horror movie.
  The romance movie cannot be shown on screen 2.
  The horror movie and the mystery movie must be shown on different screens.
  Screen 2 shows two movies, one starting at 7 P.M., and the other starting at 9 P.M.
  The sci-fi movie is not shown on screen 3.
  
Analysis:
  The horror movie and the mystery movie cannot be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. since they need to be shown on different screens.
  The romance movie cannot be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. since it cannot be shown on screen 2.
  The sci-fi movie cannot be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. since the sci-fi movie cannot be shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the 7 P.M. movie on screen 2 will be the western.
  From the choices given, list (C) appears to violate none of the given restrictions; however, other lists appear to be ruled out.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are five movies: horror, mystery, romance, sci-fi, and western.
  There are three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3.
  Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  
Analysis:
  Since there are five movies and three screens, one screen would have to show only one movie. That would be screen 3 at 8 P.M. 
  Therefore, there are four movies left for screens 1 and 2, which show two movies each.
  The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1, along with one other movie.
  The horror and mystery must be on different screens and cannot be on screen 2 with the romance. Therefore, one of the two movies on screen 2 must be the Western.
  We know that the Western starts before the horror movie. So the Western movie cannot start at 9 P.M. on screen 2, so it must be on screen 2 at 7 P.M. along with either the horror or the mystery movie.
  The sci-fi movie cannot be shown on screen 3, so that leaves screen 2 as the only screen where the sci-fi movie can be shown. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The western begins before the horror movie.
  The horror movie and the mystery movie are shown on different screens.
  The romance is not on screen 2.
  The sci-fi movie is not on screen 3.
  Screen 2 shows two movies, at 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.
  We are asked for a list of movies that cannot be shown at screen 2. 
   
A: the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 2, but the horror film could be shown at 9 P.M.
B: the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 2, and the mystery also cannot be shown on screen 2, since they both need to be on different screens.
C: the sci-fi movie cannot be shown on screen 3, but it could be shown on screen 2, together with the western movie, which could be shown at 9 P.M.
D: the western movie can be shown on screen 2, and the horror film could be shown on screen 1.
E: the western movie can be shown on screen 2, and the mystery movie could be shown on screen 1.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We are given a set of constraints on the locations of the businesses in a shopping center.
  The shoe store is located in space 4.
A: There are three possibilities for which business is next to space 1. If a restaurant (either of the two) is located in space 1, then the optometrist must be located in space 2 according to the constraint that the pharmacy be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. However, this would mean the two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses, so this configuration is not possible. If the pharmacy is located in space 1, then the optometrist and veterinarian must be located in spaces 2 and 3 in some order. There are two possible configurations with the two restaurants in the remaining spaces (5, 6, and 7), but none of them would place the optometrist next to a restaurant. Finally, if one of the two restaurants is located in space 1, then the other restaurant must be located in space 5 or 6 according to the constraint on separating the restaurants. However, this would not allow space for both the optometrist/veterinarian and the pharmacy, so this configuration is not possible. Therefore, option A is not true. 
B: According to the constraints, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. If the pharmacy is located in space 1 (because it is one end of the row), then it must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. If it is next to the optometrist (in space 2), then the veterinarian must be in space 3. This leaves spaces 5, 6, and 7 for the two restaurants, the toy store, and the optometrist, one of which must be a restaurant. In either configuration with one of the restaurants in space 7, the pharmacy would indeed be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, option B must be true.
C: According to the constraints, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses, but the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. This means that neither of the two restaurants can be next to the toy store. Since the shoe store is in space 4, there is room for one restaurant on either side of it. However, neither of those restaurants can be the one next to the toy store. Therefore, option C is not true.
D: We are given that the shoe store is in space 4, but this option claims that it is next to the toy store. According to the constraints, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, and there is no guarantee that the toy store is in space 5 or 3. Therefore, option D is not true.
E: If the pharmacy is located in space 7 (because it is one end of the row), then it must be next to the optometrist (in space 6) or the veterinarian (in space 1). If it is next to the optometrist, then the veterinarian must be in space 5, and the two restaurants must be in spaces 2, 3, and 4 in some order. Since there is no longer room for the toy store, it must be in space 7, which would mean the shoe store is next to the veterinarian. If the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, then the optometrist must be in space 6, and the two restaurants must be in spaces 2, 3, and 5 in some order. In this case, the toy store could be in space 7, and the shoe store could be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, option E must be true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The shoe store is located in Space 4. 
  There are seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and a restaurant at the other.
  Two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Eliminating options that are impossible:
  Option A is impossible since neither the optometrist nor the restaurant can go in spaces adjacent to Space 4, occupied by the Shoe Store.
  Option D is impossible since the Shoe Store is already in Space 4 and cannot be also in an adjacent space to itself.
  
Next possible things to derive:
  The Pharmacy must occupy Space 1 or Space 7 and one of the restaurants in Space 2, 3, 5 or 6. The restaurant in one of the positions next to both the pharmacy and the optometrist/veterinarian. This leaves the other restaurant with only two possible spaces.
  The Toy Store will occupy either Space 3 or Space 5. If the toy store occupies Space 3, then the veterinarian must occupy Space 2 or Space 6. If the toy store occupies Space 5, then the veterinarian must occupy Space 4 or Space 6.

Analysis:
  Using the derived information, if the shoe store is in Space 4, one thing that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. This is because if the pharmacy is in Space 1, then the veterinarian has to be in Space 2 which is adjacent to Space 4; if the pharmacy is in Space 7, then the veterinarian has to be in Space 6 which is adjacent to Space 4. 
  Ans: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces in a row, and each space will have one of seven businesses (optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian).
  - The pharmacy and a restaurant must be at opposite ends of the row.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - The shoe store is in space 4.
Analysis: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then we can deduce the following:
  - Space 1 or space 7 must have the pharmacy or one of the restaurants.
  - If space 1 or space 7 has a restaurant, then the other restaurant must be in space 4 or space 7 (because there must be at least two other businesses between the two restaurants). 
     - If the second restaurant is in space 7, then the toy store must be in space 5 or space 6 because space 3 and 7 are adjacent to the veterinarian; therefore, the first restaurant must be in space 2 or space 3. However, this conflicts with the requirement that the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or veterinarian.
     - Therefore, the second restaurant must be in space 4. This means that space 3 must be the toy store because space 2 and 5 are adjacent to the veterinarian. Space 1 must have the pharmacy or the first restaurant, leaving space 6 and 7 for the optometrist and veterinarian.
   - If space 1 or space 7 has the pharmacy, then the other end must have a restaurant.
    - If space 1 has the pharmacy, then space 7 must have the second restaurant, and space 2 and 5 cannot have the first restaurant because of the requirement that the pharmacy be adjacent to the optometrist or veterinarian. Thus, space 3 must have the first restaurant, space 6 must have the optometrist, and space 7 must have the second restaurant.
    - Similar reasoning applies if space 7 has the pharmacy. 
    - In both cases, the pharmacy and veterinarian are adjacent, so the pharmacy is not next to the veterinarian.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  5. The shoe store is in space 4.

Analysis:
If the shoe store is in space 4, then there are two businesses on each side of it. There are two possibilities for the location of the pharmacy:
1. Pharmacy is in space 1: In this case, the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2. The two restaurants must be in spaces 3 and 7 (due to constraint 1). Therefore, the toy store must be in space 5, and the other restaurant in space 6. So, Option A, B, and C are all incorrect. Also, option D is incorrect because the shoe store cannot be next to the toy store. Therefore, Option E must be true, i.e., the shoe store is next to the veterinarian.

2. Pharmacy is in space 7: In this case, the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 6. The two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 5 (due to constraint 1). Therefore, the toy store must be in space 3, and the other restaurant in space 2. None of the answer choices are true in this case. 

Since only one answer is correct, we can eliminate option B, C, and D. Now based on the above analysis, we can see that Option E is the only one that must be true. Therefore, 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - There are seven businesses that will be located in these spaces: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  - The location of these businesses are subject to some constraints:
    - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants at the other end.
    - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
    - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
    - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - We are given that the shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: Since we are given that the shoe store is in space 4, we can determine that the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7, as it must be located at one of the ends and cannot be located next to the shoe store. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and as it cannot be next to the toy store, it must be next to the veterinarian. Hence, we can conclude that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. Therefore, choice B is correct.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  - There are seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  - There are seven businesses: optometrist, pharmacy, two restaurants, shoe store, toy store, and veterinarian.
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  - The two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  - We know that the shoe store is in space 4.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: Since the shoe store is in space 4, we can place the other businesses using the constraints. The pharmacies can only be in spaces 1 or 7, but since one of the restaurants has to be at an end, the pharmacy is in space 1 or 7 and a restaurant is in space 7 or 1, respectively. There are now two cases, case 1 is where the pharmacy takes space 1, the restaurant takes space 7, the optometrist takes space 2, one restaurant takes spaces 4 to 6, the toy store takes space 3 and the vet is in space 5. In this case, the pharmacy is next to the vet which makes "B" true. In case 2, the pharmacy takes space 7, the restaurant takes space 1, the vet takes space 6, the optometrist takes space 2, the toy store takes space 4, and the restaurant takes space 3 and 5. In this case, "B" is also true because the pharmacy is next to the optometrist. Thus, "B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian" is true in both cases. Therefore, Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
There are seven spaces (1 through 7) in a straight row.
Seven businesses (optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian) will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.
Constraints:
 - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
 - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
 - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
 - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
The shoe store is in space 4.
A: The optometrist is not necessarily next to a restaurant. So, this is not a must be true statement.
B: Since the shoe store is in space 4, there are two possibilities for the pharmacy to be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
C: The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. So, if the toy store is in either space 3 or space 5, one of the restaurants should be next to the toy store to fulfill the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This statement must be true if the toy store is in either space 3 or 5.
D: The shoe store is in space 4, so it can not be next to the toy store. Therefore, this is not a must be true statement.
E: Similar to statement B, the pharmacy can be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. We do not necessarily know which one is correct. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The shopping center has exactly seven spaces arranged in a straight row.
  Seven businesses will be located in the shopping center, one in each space: an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Context:
  We are given that the shoe store is located in space 4, which means that the pharmacy, optometrist, and veterinarian cannot be in spaces 3, 4, or 5. 
  A cannot be true because the optometrist cannot be in space 3, which means that it cannot be next to a restaurant. 
  B can be true because it is possible for the pharmacy to be in space 2, which is next to the veterinarian. 
  C cannot be true because the toy store cannot be in space 3 or 5 since it cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
  D cannot be true because the shoe store is not next to the toy store. 
  E cannot be true because the shoe store is not next to the veterinarian. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The shoe store is in space 4, which means that spaces 3 and 5 are not occupied by the shoe store. The pharmacy must be at one of the ends of the row. The pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. One of the restaurants must be at the end of the row opposite the pharmacy. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
 
Using the given constraints, we can create a few different scenarios for the other stores. However, to answer the question, we can focus solely on the statement or statements that must be true.

If the shoe store is in space 4, then the only possible spaces for the pharmacy are space 1 and space 7. The pharmacy must also be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. This means that the optometrist or the veterinarian must occupy space 2 and space 6, respectively. 

Now we are left with three spaces (space 3, space 5 and a space at one of the ends). We can place the two restaurants in space 3 and space 7 (which is opposite to the pharmacy). The toy store must be next to the restaurant, so we can place the toy store in space 6, which will ensure that the toy store is not next to the veterinarian (who is in space 6).

So, the only statement that must be true given the position of the shoe store is:
Action: Answer("B") The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  We know that there are seven spaces arranged in a straight row, and that each space can be occupied by only one of the seven businesses.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the shoe store is in space 4, it must be located between space 2 and space 6.
  
Analysis:
  Option A is not necessarily true because the optometrist can be in space 3, which would make a restaurant be next to the pharmacy.
  Option B is not necessarily true because it is possible that the pharmacy is at either end and not next to the veterinarian.
  Option C is not necessarily true because the restaurant that must be at the other end is not specified to be next to the toy store.
  Option D is not true because the toy store must be located at either space 2 or space 6 and the shoe store is already located at space 4.
  Option E is the only option that must be true because the pharmacy is required to be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian and the optometrist cannot be next to the toy store, which puts the veterinarian in space 3 or space 5. Since the shoe store is at space 4, it must be next to the veterinarian.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the colors of those two rugs CANNOT be
Choices:
  A: forest and peach
  B: forest and yellow
  C: peach and turquoise
  D: peach and yellow
  E: turquoise and yellow
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, there must be one multicolored rug.
  If white is used in a rug, two other colors must be used in that rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, peach must also be used in that rug.
  Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  
Analysis:
  Let's consider all possible combinations for the two solid rugs:
  - Solid rug 1: forest, Solid rug 2: olive or peach. Multicolored rug: yellow, turquoise, and white.
  - Solid rug 1: olive, Solid rug 2: peach. Multicolored rug: forest, yellow, and turquoise.
  - Solid rug 1: forest, Solid rug 2: turquoise. Multicolored rug: olive, yellow, and white.
  - Solid rug 1: peach, Solid rug 2: turquoise. Multicolored rug: forest, olive, and white.
  - Solid rug 1: forest, Solid rug 2: yellow. Multicolored rug: olive, peach, and turquoise.
  - Solid rug 1: peach, Solid rug 2: yellow. Multicolored rug: forest, olive, and turquoise.
  
  From the above combinations, we see that the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and peach.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are six colors of thread available to weave three rugs.
  Exactly five colors will be used, and each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  White must be used with two other colors if it is used.
  Olive must be used with peach if it is used.
  Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in the same rug.
  Peach and turquoise cannot be used together in the same rug.
  Peach and yellow cannot be used together in the same rug.
  
Process: 
  We need to examine the restrictions on colors and the characteristics of solid rugs to determine the colors that we cannot use for the two solid rugs, given the restrictions.
  Since there are three rugs, we know that one of them must be multicolored.
  For a solid rug, only one color is used, so we cannot use any of the restrictions that apply to multiple colors.

  For a rug with white, two other colors must be used, so the third color cannot be used in a solid rug.
  
  Olive requires peach, so if we use olive in one solid rug, we cannot use peach in the other solid rug.
  
  If we use forest in one solid rug, we cannot use turquoise in the other solid rug.
  
  If we use peach in one solid rug, we cannot use yellow in the other solid rug.
  
  Likewise, if we use turquoise in one solid rug, we cannot use yellow in the other solid rug.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find the two colors that cannot be used to make solid rugs if there are exactly two solid rugs.
  A: There is no reason why forest and peach cannot be used to make solid rugs.
  B: There is no reason why forest and yellow cannot be used to make solid rugs.
  C: There is no reason why peach and turquoise cannot be used to make solid rugs.
  D: Peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be both be used to make a solid rug together, but it still leaves the possibility of each being used in a different solid rug.
  E: Turquoise and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be both be used to make a solid rug together, but it still leaves the possibility of each being used in a different solid rug.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  We need to find a combination of two colors that cannot be both used in a solid rug.
  There are six colors available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow 
  Each solid rug will use only one color.
  The colors of the other multicolored rug will include three distinct colors. 
  The 'white' color will never be the only color in a rug, and must be paired with two other colors. 
  The 'olive' color must be paired with 'peach'. 
  'Forest' and 'turquoise' are not used together in multicolored rugs. 
  'Peach' and 'turquoise' are not used together in multicolored rugs. 
  'Peach' and 'yellow' are not used together in multicolored rugs. 

Analysis: 
  Let's analyze each option and see if the two colors can be used in a solid rug.
  (A) If we use forest and peach for a solid rug, then it is still possible to have another solid rug of yellow or olive.
  (B) If we use forest and yellow for a solid rug, then it is still possible to have another solid rug of peach or olive.
  (C) If we use peach and turquoise for a solid rug, then it is still possible to have another solid rug of forest or yellow.
  (D) If we use peach and yellow for a solid rug, then it is not possible to have another solid rug using any of the remaining colors.
  (E) If we use turquoise and yellow for a solid rug, then it is still possible to have another solid rug of forest or peach.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  There are 6 colors of thread: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly 5 of these colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  The rugs can be solid or multicolored.
  Rules:
   - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
   - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
   - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
   - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
   - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
   
There are two solid rugs to be woven out of exactly 5 colors of thread. Let's check each option against the rules to see which colors cannot be in both solid rugs: 

Option A: The two colors are forest and peach. 
- Forest cannot be used with turquoise, so neither color can be used.
- From the rules, in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. So, white, which is not used in option A, is also not used in any solid rug. Therefore, this option could be valid.
 
Option B: The two colors are forest and yellow.
- Forest cannot be used with turquoise, so neither color can be used.
- From the rules, in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. So, white, which is not used in option B, is also not used in any solid rug. Therefore, this option could be valid.

Option C: The two colors are peach and turquoise.
- Peach and turquoise cannot be used together, so neither color can be used.
- This option is not valid.

Option D: The two colors are peach and yellow.
- Peach and yellow cannot be used together, so neither color can be used.
- This option is not valid.

Option E: The two colors are turquoise and yellow
- From the rules, in any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. So, olive (which is not used in this option) cannot be in any of the solid rugs. Olive also cannot be used with white. 
- From the rule, Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
- This option is not valid.

So, options A and B are both valid. 

Action: Answer("AC")  (This answer means A and C are not the correct options.)
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are six colors of threads available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  The rugs are woven using five colors, so one color will not be used.
  The colors must follow several rules that govern how they can be used together.
  The question states that there are exactly two solid rugs, which means that the other rug must be multicolored.
  Solid rugs are woven in a single color, while multicolored rugs are woven using two or more colors.
 
Analysis:
  To determine which colors cannot be used in the solid rugs, we can try to create the two solid rugs by choosing one color for each. 
  Since there are five colors and two rugs, one color will be left out and used in the multicolored rug.
  We can use the rules provided to eliminate some of the combinations that are not possible.
  We can start with each answer choice and see if the rules are violated.

A: If forest and peach were chosen for the solid rugs, then the third color would have to be olive or turquoise since the other colors cannot be used with these two colors. However, olive cannot be used with peach, so this combination is not possible.

B: If forest and yellow were chosen for the solid rugs, the third color would have to be either peach or turquoise. However, peach and turquoise cannot be used together, so this combination is not possible.

C: If peach and turquoise were chosen for the solid rugs, the third color would have to be either olive or yellow. These colors can be used together, so this is a possible combination.

D: If peach and yellow were chosen for the solid rugs, the third color would have to be either olive or turquoise. However, olive cannot be used with peach, so this combination is not possible.

E: If turquoise and yellow were chosen for the solid rugs, the third color would have to be either peach or forest. However, peach cannot be used with yellow, and forest cannot be used with turquoise. Therefore, this combination is not possible.

Action: Answer("A") 
Therefore, the colors that cannot be used in the solid rugs are forest and peach, so the answer is A.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  We need to eliminate the combination of colors that cannot be used in solid rugs according to the rules mentioned in the context.
  We are given 6 colors to choose from, and each rug will have exactly 1 or 3 colors.
  5 colors will be used in total, and each color will be used only once.
  In a rug where olive is used, peach must also be used.
  In a rug where white is used, two other colors must also be used.
  Forest and turquoise can not be used together in any rug.
  Peach and turquoise can not be used together in any rug.
  Peach and yellow can not be used together in any rug.
  
Process:
  Let's eliminate the colors from the given choices that cannot be used in a solid rug:
    According to the context, we cannot have a solid rug with three colors of threads, as each rug will have exactly 1 or 3 colors.
    If there are exactly two solid rugs:
    - In the first solid rug, there will be exactly one color.
    - In the second solid rug, there will be exactly one color.
    - In the third rug, there will be three colors.
    
    We need to consider all possible combinations of 5 colors where exactly 2 colors are used for solid rugs:
    1. forest and olive cannot be used together in a rug, so we can not use them both in our case. None of the options is correct.
    2. forest and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so we can not use them both in our case. Answer("B").
    3. peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, so we can not use them both in our case. None of the options is correct.
    4. peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so we can not use them both in our case. Answer("D").
    5. turquoise and yellow can be used together and do not violate any rule. None of the options is correct.
    
  Therefore, the answer is B: forest and yellow.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  There are six colors to choose from: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, yellow. 
  Exactly five colors will be weaved.
  The rugs can be either solid or multicolored.
  In any rug with white, two other colors are used.
  In any rug with olive, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in any rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in any rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in any rug.
  If there are exactly 2 solid rugs, then that leaves 3 colors left to be used in a multicolored rug. 
Analysis:
  We can first deduce colors that can't be used in a solid rug according to the rules:
  - The rules state that in any rug with white, at least two more colors are used, so white can't be used.
  - If olive is used, peach must also be used. Therefore, if peach can't be used in a rug, olive can't either.
  Now, think about all the possible 2-color combinations that can't be used in a solid rug. Any 2-color combination that violates the provided rules above can't be in a solid rug.
  Any two-color combination with forest or turquoise violates the fourth rule and can't be used together. So, forest and turquoise can't be in the same solid rug. That eliminates choices (A) and (B).
  Any two-color combination with peach violates the fifth rule and can't be used together. So, peach and yellow can't be in the same solid rug. That eliminates choice (D).
  That leaves the combination of peach and turquoise, which violates the sixth rule and can't be a solid rug either. That eliminates choice (C).
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, exactly two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach must also be used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug. 
Analysis:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then those two rugs must have exactly one color and the third rug must have four colors. 
  If forest is used in a solid rug, then none of the colors that are not used with forest can be used in the other solid rug. The forbidden colors for a rug that uses forest are olive, peach, and white. Therefore, none of the choices that include forest can be the colors of the two solid rugs. 
  If peach is used in a solid rug, then olive must be used in the same rug. Therefore, none of the choices that include peach can be the colors of the two solid rugs. 
  If turquoise is used in a solid rug, then yellow cannot be used in any of the three rugs. Therefore, choice E cannot be the colors of the two solid rugs. 
  This leaves us with the only choice that has not been eliminated:
Action: Answer("B") - forest and yellow
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  There are six available colors of thread: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the three rugs.
  Each color will be used in only one of the three rugs.
  The rugs can be either solid - woven in a single color - or multicolored.
  If white is used in a rug, two other colors are also used in the rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, peach is also used in the rug.
  Forest and turquoise are not together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not together in a rug.

The two solid rugs would have to each use exactly one color, which would mean that the multicolored rug would have to use three colors. 

Let's try to create two solid rugs using each of the color options:
  A: Forest and Peach
    Cannot be a solid combination because Peach cannot be used in a rug with Yellow, leaving only Turquoise and Olive as other available colors. However, Turquoise and Forest cannot be used together either, so this is not possible.
  B: Forest and Yellow
    This combination could be possible as a solid rug.
  C: Peach and Turquoise
    This combination could be possible as a solid rug.
  D: Peach and Yellow
    This combination could be possible as a solid rug.
  E: Turquoise and Yellow 
    Cannot be a solid combination since only one color would be left, and it would need to be used in the multicolored rug.

Out of the three remaining options, two of them can be used as solid colors.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: Verma could be the project leader if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The project leader must be one of the three selected project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected --> This means there is no possible project leader, since Quinn can only be a project member if he/she is leading the project, and Smith must be a project member if Taylor is a project member.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected --> This means either Smith (and therefore Taylor) or Wells is a project member. If Smith (and Taylor) is a project member, then Verma cannot be a project member, so this option is not possible. If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, which leaves Verma as the only possible project leader. This option is possible.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected --> This means that neither Smith nor Taylor can be project members. But if neither Smith nor Taylor is a project member, then Wells cannot be a project member either, since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members if Wells is a project member. Thus, there cannot be a project leader under this scenario. This option is not possible.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected --> This does not provide enough information about who the project members are, so we cannot determine if Verma could be the project leader. This option is not possible.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected --> This means either Smith (and therefore Taylor) or Wells is a project member. If Smith and Taylor are project members, then Verma cannot be because if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, which leaves Verma as the only possible project leader. This option is possible.
  
Action: Answer("B")  or Answer("E") since both options are possible.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The project must have exactly one leader and three members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a team member if they are the leader.
  If Smith is a member, Taylor must be a member.
  If Wells is a member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a member.
  
Elimination:
  For Verma to be a project leader, he cannot be a team member. 
  If Verma is not selected, then Wells must be, but if Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members. Thus Wells cannot be leader.
  
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
    If neither Quinn nor Smith are selected, then Verma could be a member, but without Wells, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members, so this option is not valid.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
    If neither Ruiz nor Taylor are selected, then Verma could be a member and Quinn could be the leader, so this option is invalid since Taylor must be selected if Smith is a member.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
    If neither Smith nor Taylor are selected, then Verma could be a member and Quinn could be the leader, so this option is valid.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
    If neither Smith nor Xue are selected, then only Taylor and Verma could be members, but without Wells, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be members, so this option is not valid.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
    If neither Taylor nor Wells are selected, then Verma could be a member and Quinn could be the leader, so this option is valid.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three of the seven workers will be selected to be project members.
  Exactly one of the three project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
  Analysis:
  For Verma to be the project leader, Verma must be selected as a project member and one of Quinn or Ruiz must also be selected as a project member. Otherwise, Verma will not be eligible for the project leader role. 
  
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. - If only one of Quinn and Ruiz can be selected and none of Smith and Taylor can be unselected, then the remaining slot is not enough for Verma to be selected. So, Verma cannot be the project leader. Incorrect.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. - If none of Quinn and Ruiz are selected, then Verma cannot be selected as a project member, so Verma cannot be the project leader. Incorrect.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. - In this case, either both Quinn and Ruiz or Wells can be the project members and one can be project lead. So, Verma can be the project leader. But, we cannot be sure of project members without further information. So, this option is possible. 
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. - We cannot be sure of project members without further information. Incorrect.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. - If Smith is one of the three members selected and the leader, then Taylor must be included. Then, the remaining slot is too small for Verma to be selected. So, Verma cannot be the project leader. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Three workers will be selected to be project members, and one will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  - If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  - If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis: 
If Verma is the project leader, then he must be a project member too. From the given information, we know that if Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Wells cannot be a project member.
If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, hence Smith cannot be the project leader. Ruiz cannot be a project member since Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, and since we already know that Smith cannot be the project leader, hence, Ruiz cannot be the project leader either.
If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then it is possible for Taylor to be selected, and in this case, Verma cannot be a project member, hence Verma cannot be the project leader.
If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Quinn must be the project leader, but since Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is a project member, hence Verma cannot be the project leader in this case.
If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then it is possible for Taylor to be selected, and in this case, Verma can be a project member and a project leader.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
- Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members.
- Exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
- Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
- If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
- If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

We need to determine if Verma could be the project leader based on the given constraints.

If Verma is the project leader, then two project members must be selected from Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue who satisfy the constraints. We can eliminate options E and D because any of the selected group in these options won't allow Wells to be a project member as required by the constraints. Option A does not allow Quinn to be a project member so we can eliminate it too.

Option B satisfies the constraints as Quinn can be a project member since he can only be if he's leading the project, and Taylor or Wells can join as members. Smith cannot be a member as Taylor can only be a member if Smith is selected.

Option C also satisfies the constraints. Wells can lead the project, Verma and Xue can be project members, and Smith and Taylor cannot be members.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Three workers are going to be selected for a project, and one of them will be the leader. There are 7 workers: Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue. 
  Q or R can be a member only if selected as the leader.
  If S is a member, T must also be.
  If W is a member, neither R nor V can be.
  
A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then they cannot be a project leader, which means that neither Ruiz nor Verma would be project members. Therefore, there would not be a possibility for Verma to be the project leader from the remaining group of workers. Incorrect.
B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, they cannot be the leader, which means at least 2 out of Quinn, Smith, Wells, Verma, and Xue would be selected. Therefore, there would not be a possibility for Verma to be the project leader from the remaining group of workers. Incorrect.
C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, they cannot be leader or project members. This means that there are only 5 workers left (Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue) who can be selected and one of them will be a project leader. Verma could be selected as a project leader in this case. Keep as a potential answer.
D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, they cannot be the leader or project members. This means there are only 5 workers left (Quinn, Ruiz, Taylor, Verma, and Wells) who can be selected and one of them will be a project leader. In this case, however, Verma cannot be the project leader; to ensure that both Verma and Wells can be project members, Ruiz must be the project leader, which means Verma cannot be the project leader. Incorrect.
E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, they cannot be the leader or project members. This means that there are only 5 workers left (Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Verma, and Xue) who can be selected and one of them will be a project leader. In this case, however, Verma cannot be the project leader; to ensure that Verma can be a project member, Ruiz must be the project leader, which contradicts the statement that neither Taylor nor Wells can be selected. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Only three workers will be selected to be project members and only one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  
Analysis:
  If Verma is selected to be the project leader, we should evaluate the options which allow her to be selected.
  Only three people will be selected from seven, so we should check the cases where at most two of the people mentioned in the constraints will be selected.
  (A) Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected:
      If Smith is not selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. Since Ruiz can only be a project member if he/she is the project leader, Ruiz cannot be selected too. Finally, Wells should not be selected because if he/she is selected, we cannot select Verma since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is selected. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader in this case.
  (B) Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected:
      If Taylor is not selected, Smith cannot be a project member. Then, Quinn and Wells should not be selected because Ruiz cannot be a project member without being the leader, and Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is a project member. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader in this case.
  (C) Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected:
      In this case, Wells can be a project member, which means that neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members. It also means that if Quinn is selected, he/she should be the leader. So, Verma can be the leader in this case if Quinn is also a project member.
  (D) Neither Smith nor Xue is selected:
      If Smith is not selected, Taylor cannot be a project member, which means Quinn and Ruiz cannot also be project members. If Xue is not selected, Wells cannot be a project member because if Wells is a project member, we cannot select Verma or Ruiz. This means that Verma cannot be a project member too. Therefore, Verma cannot be the leader in this case since she cannot be a project member.
  (E) Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected:
      If Taylor is not selected, Smith cannot be a project member. Then, we should select two project members from Quinn, Ruiz, Xue, and Verma, keeping in mind the limitations mentioned in the constraints. Since only one of them can be the project leader between Quinn and Ruiz and Wells and Verma cannot work together, we should select only one from this group. Therefore, Verma can be the project leader and member in this case.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Three workers will be selected for the project and one of them will be the project leader.
  - Quinn or Ruiz can only be selected if leading the project.
  - If Smith is selected, Taylor must also be. 
  - If Wells is selected, Ruiz and Verma can't be selected.
  
Analysis:
  - If Verma is the project leader, then Wells is not a project member. 
  - Therefore, from the last two constraints, either Ruiz or Quinn must be selected and Smith must also be selected. 
  - If both Quinn and Smith are selected, then the third person cannot be Verma because of the constraint that Verma cannot be selected if Wells is selected. This means that either Ruiz or Taylor must be selected, and either of them could be the leader. 
  - If Ruiz is selected instead of Quinn, then only Taylor is left, who can't be the leader. Hence, Quinn must be selected. 
  
Action: Answer("A") since if neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Verma can be the leader, and two other workers who fulfill the constraints can be selected to be the members.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Exactly three of seven workers will be selected to be project members.
- Exactly one of them will also be the project leader.
- Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
- If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
- If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

Analysis:
- If Verma is chosen as the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be selected as project members because they can only be project members if they are leading the project.
- If Wells is selected as a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected as project members (given constraint), and as a result, they will also not be considered as project leaders.
- If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be; thus, they both cannot be project leaders.
- Xue is not mentioned in any of the constraints, so they can be a project member or a project leader.

Answers:
A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected - Verma cannot be the project leader because Quinn will not be selected as a member if he is not the leader and Smith cannot be a member without Taylor.
B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected - Verma cannot be the project leader because Ruiz cannot be a member without being the leader.
C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected - Verma cannot be the project leader because Smith cannot be a member without Taylor.
D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected - This could be a possibility, but it does not affect Verma's position as a project leader.
E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected - This could be a possibility. If Taylor and Wells are not selected as members, then Smith must not be a member, and thus Ruiz or Quinn can be the third member who would lead the project. Given the constraints, only Verma would be the project leader in this scenario.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Exactly three workers will be selected and exactly one of them is the project leader. 
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if the person is leading the project. 
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be a project member. 
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
 
Elimination: 
  According to the given constraints, if Wells is on the project, Verma can't be on the project. Therefore for Verma to be chosen as team leader, Wells can't be on the project. So, E is eliminated.
  Taylor and Smith are connected, so if Smith is on the project, Taylor is required to be on the project. Therefore, C and D are eliminated. 
  According to the given constraints, if Quinn or Ruiz is on the project, they must be the team leader. Therefore, A is eliminated as Verma can only be the team leader. 
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  Verma could be the project leader if neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. So, Verma can be selected along with Quinn (as a team leader) and Smith (required to have Taylor as team members). This satisfies all of the given constraints.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown in the afternoon.
  C: L is shown in the evening.
  D: M is shown in the morning.
  E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. J must be shown in the evening.
  2. K cannot be shown in the morning.
  3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  4. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning;
  5. The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon;
  6. The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  
- From 1, we know that J is shown in the evening.
- From 2, we know that K is shown in the afternoon or in the evening.
- From 3, we know that K and M sandwich L.
- From 4, we know that the first and second houses are shown in the morning, so neither J nor L could be one of the first two houses.
- From 5, we know that L cannot be shown as the fifth, so L must either be shown as the third or as the fourth.
- From 6, we know that J is shown in the last two houses; since L is shown only after K, L must be the last house shown in the afternoon and K must be the first house shown in the evening; also, M must be shown in the evening.

Analysis:
Therefore, we can conclude the following:
- K is shown in the evening, because J is shown in the last two houses.
- L and M are shown in the afternoon and in the evening, respectively.
- Thus, none of the choices A, B, D, or E could be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show 7 houses to the buyer in a day, two in the morning, three in the afternoon, and two in the evening.   
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, J cannot be shown in the morning or in the afternoon. It also says that K cannot be shown in the morning, which means that K will either be shown in the afternoon or evening. Since L must be shown after K and before M, and we know that J will be shown in the evening, this leaves only the afternoon for K and L to be shown. It also tells us that M will be shown after L. Therefore, we can conclude that M will be shown in the evening, which means it cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
   
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The first and second houses are shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses are shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses are shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening, which means it can only be house 6 or 7.
  K cannot be shown in the morning. That leaves it to be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
  (Option A) K cannot be shown in the morning, and it is not required to be shown in the evening.
  (Option B) L must be shown at some time after K is shown, which means K has to be shown before L. Since K cannot be shown in the morning, it needs to be shown in the afternoon with L later in the afternoon, making it house 4 or 5.
  (Option C) L must be shown at some time before M is shown and after K is shown. Since L is shown in the afternoon, M needs to be shown in the evening.
  (Option D) M cannot be shown in the morning, since it is part of the afternoon set of houses along with L and one other house.
  (Option E) M is shown in the afternoon along with L and one other house.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show 7 houses in a single day. 
  First and second houses will be shown in the morning. 
  Third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon. 
  Sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at a time after K and before M.

Analysis:
  Since J must be shown in the evening, only two houses are left to show at night (i.e., M and N). So, the morning houses must be K and P, whereas the afternoon houses must be L, M, and N. It is known that K is not shown in the morning. Thus, K must be shown in the afternoon. Moreover, since L must be shown after K and before M, the correct order of showing the houses must be P, K, L, N, M, O, and J. Thus, neither K nor L are shown in the evening.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  A realtor is showing seven houses to a prospective buyer.
  The first and second houses are shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses are shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses are shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Elimination:
  A: K cannot be shown in the evening, therefore A is false.
  D: The rule is that J must be shown in the evening, therefore D is false.
  E: It is only revealed that M is shown after "L", therefore E is false.
  
Evaluation:
  Between K, L, and M, the order is K, L, M. However, the time of day that they are shown isn't specified.
  Answering B would give an order of K, L, M but violates the requirement that J must be shown in the evening.
  Answering C provides an order of J, K, L, M which satisfies all the rules given.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show 7 houses: J, K, L, M, N, O, and P.
  The first two houses will be shown in the morning, the next three will be shown in the afternoon, and the last two will be shown in the evening.
  J will be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L is shown after K and before M.
  
Analysis:
  The realtor will show 7 houses to a prospective buyer in a specific order: the first and second in the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth in the afternoon, and the last two in the evening. Therefore A and D are eliminated.
  J must be shown in the evening, therefore A and B are eliminated.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, therefore A is eliminated. 
  L is shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. There are three available spots to place L: afternoon (after K and before M), evening (the last two in the evening), and later in the morning (before K). Therefore, B and E are possible, but only C must be true.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses to a prospective buyer during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Reasoning:
  Choice A contradicts the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning.
  Choice B contradicts the rule that L cannot be shown in the afternoon.
  Choice C satisfies all the given conditions.
  Choice D contradicts the rule that M cannot be shown in the morning.
  Choice E contradicts the rule that M cannot be shown in the morning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The houses must be shown in the following order: J, K, _, _, _, L, M, P.
  J is shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Analysis:
  A: K cannot be shown in the evening, so this is not possible.
  B: L must be shown between K and M, but it does not specify a specific time of day, so this is possible. 
  C: J must be shown in the evening, so this is not possible.
  D: M must be shown after L, which cannot be in the morning, so this is not possible.
  E: M must be shown after L, and since L is shown in the afternoon, M must also be shown in the afternoon.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses during a single day.
  The first and second houses will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Reasoning:
  J must be shown in the evening, so either house 6 or 7 must be J. 
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown either in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L must be shown between the times that K and M are shown.
  Therefore, the schedule of houses must be: {Morning: [?,?], Afternoon: [K,L,M], Evening: [J, ?]}.
  
Action: Answer("E") - M is shown in the afternoon. 
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, O, and P—during the day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  Since J must be shown in the evening, then the sixth or seventh house to be shown must be J.
  Since K cannot be shown in the morning, then K must be shown in the afternoon or in the evening.
  Since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, then the possible arrangements for K, L, and M are: KL...M, KLM, or LMK.
  Since the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon, then L cannot be shown in the afternoon if K is also shown in the afternoon. Also, M cannot be shown in the morning.

Solutions:
A: K is shown in the evening. (Cannot be true because it can be shown in the afternoon)
B: L is shown in the afternoon. (Cannot be true because if L is shown after K and before M, then L cannot be shown in the afternoon)
C: L is shown in the evening. (Can be true if the arrangement is KLM, then L must be shown in the evening after K is shown in the afternoon)
D: M is shown in the morning. (Cannot be true because M cannot be shown in the morning)
E: M is shown in the afternoon. (Can be true if the arrangement is KLM, then M must be shown in the afternoon after L is shown in the afternoon)

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Jaramillo must also be assigned an ambassadorship since this is a requirement that if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one of the countries, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned an ambassadorship, it can only be Zambia.
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("D") - Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, because it was stated that if Jaramillo is assigned an ambassadorship, Kayne must also be assigned an ambassadorship which contradicts the scenario where Kayne is assigned an ambassadorship to Yemen only. Hence, Jaramillo cannot be assigned an ambassadorship.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- The five candidates are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong.
- One ambassador will be assigned to each of the three countries: Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia.
- No ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
- Constraints:
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  
Analysis:
- If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then:
  - Neither Novetzke nor Jaramillo can be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, because that would mean that Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which is not allowed.
  - Landon cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen, because only one ambassador can be assigned to each country.
  - Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela (because if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned as ambassador to one of the ambassadorships).
  - Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia (because if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia).
  - That means Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - That means Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

Action: Answer("D") - Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 3 countries to which ambassadors need to be assigned: Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia.
  - The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong.
  - One ambassador will be assigned to each country.
  - No ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen:
    - Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela (because if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne).
    - Landon cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen (because no ambassador can be assigned to more than one country).
    - Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Zambia (because if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen).
    - Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia (because If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia).
  
  So, the answer is B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. 
  Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to Yemen or Venezuela.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, and Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Yemen, then Kayne must be assigned to the other country.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Action: Answer("B") 

If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, and Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. The only remaining option for Landon is to be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Therefore, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Kayne or Novetzke will be the ambassador of Venezuela, Yemen being already taken.
  - If Jaramillo is a ambassador, then Kayne is going to be an ambassador too.
  - If Ong is an ambassador of Venezuela, Kayne is not going to be an ambassador of Yemen.
  - Landon is the ambassador of Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

If Kayne is assigned as ambassador of Yemen, then neither Kayne nor Novetzke can be assigned as the ambassador of Venezuela. This is because Venezuela is the only country left to be assigned to either Kayne or Novetzke. Thus, Jaramillo cannot be assigned to Venezuela, so we do not know whether he is assigned as ambassador or not. We also know that Landon is the ambassador of Zambia. And if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. So the only thing we know for sure is that Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Therefore, the answer is B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned as an ambassador.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned as an ambassador.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as an ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it is to Zambia.
Action: The only option that definitely must be true is B, so Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to any other country since that would violate the constraint that each ambassador is assigned to a different country.
  - If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships since that would violate the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, meaning that they cannot both be left without an ambassadorship.
  - If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to the ambassadorship for Zambia, since he cannot be assigned to more than one country.

Analysis:
  Since Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, we know that Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships. We also know that if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one of the countries, then Kayne must also be assigned as ambassador to a country. If Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then no ambassadorship remains for Jaramillo, Novetzke, or Ong. Therefore, the only option that remains is:
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Kayne or Novetzke should be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  2. If Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne should also be assigned.
  3. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne should not be assigned to Yemen.
  4. If Landon is assigned, it will be to Zambia.
  
  A: There is no direct relationship between Venezuela and Yemen, so it cannot be concluded whether Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela if Kayne is assigned to Yemen.
  B: There is no direct relationship between Yemen and Zambia, so it cannot be concluded whether Landon is assigned to Zambia if Kayne is assigned to Yemen.
  C: The information in the question cannot determine whether Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  D: If Kayne is assigned to Yemen, there is no direct constraint on whether Jaramillo can be assigned to an ambassadorship. However, given that the candidates for the ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong and that one candidate can only fill one role, if the first four candidates are assigned ambassadorships, Jaramillo will not be assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: There is no direct relationship between Kayne being assigned to Yemen and whether Ong will be assigned to an ambassadorship. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Reasoning:
- Since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the three countries.
- According to the third constraint, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to any country, Jaramillo must be assigned as an ambassador to some country. Thus A and D cannot be true.
- According to the fifth constraint, Landon must be assigned as an ambassador to Zambia. Thus B cannot be true.
- According to the fourth constraint, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. Thus C cannot be true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned as ambassador to any of the countries.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one of the countries, then Kayne must also be assigned as an ambassador.

Analysis:
- If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned as an ambassador to any of the countries. 
- If Jaramillo is assigned an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned an ambassadorship, of which only two remain; that means that assigning Kayne to Yemen and Jaramillo to Venezuela would satisfy all of the constraints.
- If Jaramillo is not assigned an ambassadorship, then there are three possible assignments to consider:
  1) Assign Landon to Zambia, Novetzke to Venezuela, and Ong to Yemen. This satisfies all constraints, and it's not the answer.
  2) Assign Landon to Zambia, Novetzke to Yemen, and Ong to Venezuela. This assignment satisfies all constraints, but it contradicts the given if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  3) Assign Ong to Zambia, Novetzke to Venezuela, and Jaramillo to Yemen. This assignment contradicts the given that Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned ambassadors to the same country.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are six members in the band: guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist.
  Each member performs exactly one solo.
  Guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  Percussionist performs before keyboard player.
  Keyboard player performs after violinist and before guitarist.
  Saxophonist performs after either percussionist or trumpeter, but not both.

Option Analysis:
  E: Violinist performs before keyboard player, but after that he could perform the third solo.
  D: Trumpeter could perform the first, second, or fifth solo if saxophonist performs after percussionist. And after that, keyboard player could perform the third solo.
  C: Saxophonist performs after either percussionist or trumpeter, but not both. He could perform the third solo if he performs after percussionist, and then keyboard player performs the solo, or if he performs after trumpeter, then guitarist performs solo and keyboard player performs after the violinist.
  A: Guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo. But he could perform the second or fifth solo, and after that, keyboard player performs at third.
  B: Keyboard player performs after violinist and before guitarist. He could perform the third solo.
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, thus he performs either the first, second, third, fifth, or sixth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Six band members—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist—each performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.

Process of Elimination:
  A cannot perform the third solo since the guitarist cannot perform the fourth one.
  B can perform the third solo since she/he can perform a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does, both of which are undefined times.
  C can perform the third solo since he/she can perform a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, and neither of them are restricted to soloing at any specific time.
  D can perform the third solo since the percussionist is not restricted to performing a solo during the third solo.
  E cannot perform the third solo since the keyboard player's solo must occur after the violinist's.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Each member performs exactly one solo during the concert.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation:
The third solo can only be performed by the saxophonist or percussionist, since they are the only two members who perform after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. The trumpeter performs some time before the saxophonist does or before the percussionist does, thus cannot perform the third solo. Therefore, the answer is D: trumpeter.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo
  - The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
Action: 
  - The third solo cannot be performed after the guitarist solo and before the violinist solo, because the keyboard player must solo after the violinist and before the guitarist. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform before the third solo, meaning the third solo cannot be performed by the keyboard player.
Answer: Answer("B") - keyboard player.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Each of the six members of the band performs one solo during the concert.
  - The guitarist is NOT the fourth performer.
  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
Analysis:
  - We are looking for the member that cannot perform the third solo.
  - From the rules provided, we cannot directly identify which member performs the third solo.
  - We know that the guitarist is not the fourth soloist, but we don't know when they perform.
  - We also know that the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  - Therefore, there are 3 possible orderings on who performs the third solo: violinist-saxophonist-keyboard player, percussionist-saxophonist-keyboard player, or trumpeter-saxophonist-keyboard player.
  - Let's go through each member and see if they can fit in any of these orderings.
  
Answer: Answer("A") - The guitarist could possibly perform as the third soloist in the order violinist-guitarist-saxophonist-keyboard player. Therefore, guitarist is not excluded from performing third. The other choices, keyboard player, saxophonist, trumpeter, and violinist all can fit into at least one of the possible orderings for the third soloist. None of the other choices can be eliminated.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - There are 6 members in the band, they will perform exactly one solo and will perform in a certain order.
  - The guitarist will not perform the fourth solo.
  - The percussionist will perform a solo before the keyboard player.
  - The keyboard player will perform a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - The saxophonist will perform a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
To determine who can't perform at the third solo, we have to derive the order of performances looking at the given restrictions.

1. If the guitarist is performing at either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd solo, the saxophonist will perform after the percussionist (and trumpeter will perform before the saxophonist). But as per given restrictions, the guitarist can't perform at the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform at either the 5th or 6th solo.
2. The percussionist can perform first after the guitarist and saxophonist can perform second.
3. The saxophonist cannot perform 3rd because in that case, there will be no option left for the keyboard player to perform as the keyboard player should perform after the violinist and before the guitarist.
4. Thus, we can conclude that the keyboard player will perform third. 
5. After the keyboard player, either the percussionist will perform or trumpeter will perform (as saxophonist cannot perform at 3rd).
6. There are two spots left for solos - one for the guitarist (as per the first restriction) and one for either the percussionist or the trumpeter.
 
From the given choices, we have to identify who cannot perform at the third solo. From our derived sequence, we know that the keyboard player will perform at the third position. So, the answer is not B i.e. keyboard player.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  A six-member band gives a concert, each member performs exactly one solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  
Let's consider the 3rd soloist:
  * It can't be the saxophonist since they perform after the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  * It can't be the percussionist since they perform before the keyboard player.
  * It can't be the guitarist since they don't perform the fourth solo.
  * It can't be the trumpet player since they aren't a constraint for the 3rd soloist.
  * It can't be the keyboard player since they perform after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  Therefore, the only option left is the violinist who performs somewhere before the keyboard player.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Six-member band gives a concert, each performs exactly one solo.
  - Guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  - Percussionist performs before keyboard player.
  - Keyboard player performs after violinist and before guitarist.
  - Saxophonist performs after either percussionist or trumpeter.
 
Process of elimination:
- The first solo can be played by any of the six members.
- The last solo has to be played by either the guitarist or the violinist.
- The guitarist cannot play the fourth solo.
- The percussionist plays before keyboard player. Therefore, the percussionist cannot perform the last solo, which means the percussionist either plays the first or second solo.
- The keyboard player plays after violinist and before guitarist. Therefore, the keyboard player must play the last or the fifth solo.
- The saxophonist plays after either percussionist or trumpeter but not both. Therefore, saxophonist plays either the second, third, fifth or sixth solo.

Option C: saxophonist can play the third solo since the saxophonist can play either the second, third, fifth or sixth solo. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo and there are only six solos to be performed.
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  
Elimination:
  If the guitarist performs third, then the violinist performs before the keyboard player and the guitarist himself. This is not possible due to the positions of the violinist and keyboard player. Thus, it's not (A).
  If the keyboard player performs third, then the violinist performs before him and the guitarist performs after him. This is not possible due to the positions of the keyboard player and the guitarist. Thus, it's not (B).
  If the saxophonist performs third, then the percussionist and trumpeter would have already performed before him. This is possible and not in violation of any rules. Thus, it could be (C).
  If the trumpeter performs third, then the saxophonist may perform after both the percussionist and trumpeter which is again possible and not in violation of any rules. Thus, it could be (D).
  If the violinist performs third, then the percussionist must have already performed before him and the keyboard player must perform after him and before the guitarist. This is not possible. Thus, it's (E).

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the sixth audition?
Choices:
  A: Kammer's audition
  B: Lugo's audition
  C: Trillo's audition
  D: Waite's audition
  E: Zinn's audition
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
The fifth audition must be recorded.
Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
There are six singers total auditioning

Analysis:
Since Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded, they must be either the first or second to audition. Since the fifth audition must be recorded, we know exactly where the fifth audition lands, leaving only three possible slots for the fourth audition. Since Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions, Waite must be in either the first or second audition. Kammer's audition must take place before Trillo's so one of their auditions must be in the first three slots. Finally, Zinn's audition must take place before Yoshida's audition so one of their auditions must be in the last two slots.

Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore according to these conditions, Trillo's audition could be the sixth audition.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  There are six auditions that will take place in succession, with two of them being recorded.
  The auditions have specific conditions that must be met.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth one must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, and Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  Since Kammer's audition is recorded, it must take place either first or second.
  Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, and work backwards from the last audition, only Kammer's and Lugo's audition can be the first two auditions that are recorded.
  Waite's audition must be earlier than the second recorded audition, so it must be the first one.
  Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's, so Trillo's cannot be the sixth.

Action: Answer("E") 
  Therefore, the sixth audition could be Zinn's audition.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  There are six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  
Analysis:
  To determine the possible candidates for the sixth audition, we need to consider the order in which the auditions can take place and the conditions that must be satisfied. According to the conditions given, the order of the auditions must be: 
  1. Waite
  2. Kammer
  3. Trillo
  4. (unrecorded audition)
  5. Lugo
  6. Yoshida
  7. Zinn
  
  Based on this order, the only candidate for the sixth audition is:
  
Action: Answer("C")  (Trillo's audition)
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - There are six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  - Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  - There are six auditions to take place one after the other that follow the following conditions:
    - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
    - The fifth audition must be recorded.
    - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
    - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
    - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

Analysis:
  - If Zinn's audition is the fifth, then Kammer's audition must be the first and Waite's audition must be the fourth. The position of Lugo's and Trillo's auditions are still unknown. Zinn's audition being first to fourth are not possible as the auditions of Waite and the fourth audition cannot both be unrecorded.
  - If Trillo's audition is the fifth, Kammer's audition is the first, Waite's audition is the fourth, and Zinn's and Lugo's auditions come before Trillo's. However, there is no place for the unrecorded audition of either Waite or the fourth in this order. 
  - From the above two points, it can be inferred that Zinn's audition cannot be the fifth audition.
  - If Waite's audition is the fifth, then the recorded auditions will have to be done at Trillo and Lugo, and this cannot be done as per the conditions.
  - Therefore there is only one possible option left, which is
Action: Answer("C") Trillo's audition.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The conditions given are:
  1. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be.
  2. The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  3. The fifth audition must be recorded.
  4. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  5. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  6. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fifth audition has to be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions, so it must be the first, second, or third.
  Kammer's audition has to be before Trillo's audition, so it could be the second, third, fourth, or fifth.
  Zinn's audition has to be before Yoshida's audition, so it could be the first, second, third, or fourth.
  Therefore, the possible order of auditions is: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, and the fifth audition (either Kammer or Lugo). The sixth audition will be the one that is not in the list of the first five.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Six singers will be auditioned: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
- Two auditions (Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition) will be recorded; the other four will not be recorded.
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
- The fifth audition must be recorded.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.

From the information, we know that Lugo's audition is going to be recorded. Since Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, then Waite's audition must be either first or second. Kammer's audition is also a recorded audition and he must audition before Trillo. Therefore, the possible order for the first four auditions are:
- Waite, Kammer, Lugo, and Trillo
- Kammer, Waite, Lugo, and Trillo

Since the fourth audition cannot be recorded, then the fourth audition is not Trillo. Since the fifth audition must be recorded, then the fifth audition is not Waite, Kammer, or Lugo. Since Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, and we have not assigned audition order for Zinn and Yoshida, we will assume that Zinn auditions before Yoshida. 

Action: Answer("C")  
Therefore, the sixth audition could be Trillo's audition. Since we have assigned the order for the first four auditions and the order for the last two auditions does not affect whether Trillo could be the sixth audition.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Kammer's audition must occur before Trillo's audition.
  The fourth audition can not be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must occur before the two recorded auditions.
  Zinn's audition must occur before Yoshida's audition.
 
Reasoning:
  Since Waite's audition must occur before the two recorded auditions, Waite's audition must be either first, second, or third. Therefore, the rest of the order must be one of the following:
  1. Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Lugo, Yoshida, with the fourth audition being Trillo's.
  2. Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida, Lugo, with the fourth audition being Trillo's.
  3. Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida, with the fourth audition being Zinn's.
  4. Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Trillo, Yoshida, Lugo, with the fourth audition being Zinn's.
  
  Therefore, Trillo's audition could be the sixth audition.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The auditions will be held for six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  Two auditions will be recorded and the other four will not be recorded.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
Analysis:
  Since the fifth audition must be recorded and the fourth audition cannot be recorded, the fifth audition must be either Kammer or Lugo. Therefore, the sixth audition must be one of Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, or Zinn, except for the fifth audition which is Kammer/Lugo.
  Waite's audition must take place before the two recorded auditions, which means that Waite's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, which also means Kammer's audition cannot be the last audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, which means that Zinn cannot be the last to audition.
  Therefore, the only viable option for the last audition is Trillo's audition.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  
Elimination:
  - Kammer and Lugo's auditions are already assigned, so they cannot be the sixth audition.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, the fourth audition must be an unrecorded audition, and that option can neither be the fifth nor the sixth audition.
  
Analysis:
  - Out of the remaining 4 options (Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn), Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, but only Kammer and Lugo's auditions are recorded. Therefore, Waite's audition must be one of the unrecorded auditions. This leaves us with Trillo, Yoshida, and Zinn.
  - We know that Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's audition, and Zinn's audition must be earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, the order of the auditions from the earliest to the latest must be: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida, and the final audition.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded, which means that the final audition must be unrecorded and it can only be Trillo's, Yoshida's, or Zinn's audition since Waite's is an unrecorded audition and Kammer and Lugo's are already recorded. 
  - The only option left, which meets all the given conditions, is Option (C) Trillo's audition. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded. Hence either Kammer's or Lugo's audition will be the fourth one. Therefore, one of Kammer's and Lugo's audition is the fourth.
  The fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fifth audition is either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Therefore, Waite's audition is either first, second, or third.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Hence if Kammer's audition is not the first audition, it must be the second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Hence if Zinn's audition is not the fifth audition, it must be either third or fourth.
Analysis:
  If Kammer's audition is the first audition, then Lugo's audition is the fourth which means Lugo's audition cannot be recorded, which violates the given conditions; hence this option can be eliminated.
  If Lugo's audition is the first audition, then Kammer's audition is the fourth which means Kammer's audition cannot be recorded, which violates the given conditions; hence this option can be eliminated.
  If Waite's audition is the first audition, then either Kammer's audition or Lugo's audition is the second, which must be recorded. The third audition could be Trillo's or Zinn's audition, and the fourth audition could be the one not played. The fifth audition is the remaining audition, which must be recorded, and the sixth audition could either be Trillo's, Zinn's or Yoshida's audition. Therefore, either C, E or F could be the sixth audition.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be taken by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore one of the Lifestyle photos is taken by the same photographer who took one of the Metro section photos. 
  If one photo in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue then there are six possible combinations of authors: FG, FH, HG, HH, GH, GG (where F stands for Fuentes, G for Gagnon and H for Hue). 
  Fuentes's and Hue's photos in the lifestyle and sports sections respectively must be equal in count.
  Gagnon cannot have photos in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer('A') 

If Gagnon and Hue provided the Lifestyle photos (i.e. HH or HG) then they cannot have any photos in the Metro or Sports section. This means only Fuentes could have taken the two photos in the Metro section. Therefore, there must be exactly one photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes. Therefore, the statement, "Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes" must be true (choice A).
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue
  - Six different photographs will appear, exactly two photographs per section: lifestyle, metro, and sports sections.
  - Each photographer’s photos must be between 1 and 3;
  - No Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section;
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section;
  - The number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photos in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must supply the remaining photo in the metro section. As the number of Hue’s photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photos in the Sports section, and there can be no Gagnon’s photos in the Sport section - therefore, none of Hue's photos can appear in the Sports section, which means Hue can only have photos in the Lifestyle and Metro sections. So, Gagnon and Fuentes must have photographs in the Sports section. Thus, Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. is the only answer that must be true.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - The newspapers have 3 sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Each section has exactly two photographs.
  - No more than three of any photographer's photographs may appear in the newspaper.
  - There must be at least one but no more than three photographs of each photographer in the newspaper.
  - There cannot be any Gagnon photograph in the Sports section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be equal to the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.

Action: Answer("B")  

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then either Fuentes or Gagnon (but not both) must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle and Metro sections. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can appear in the Sports section, exactly one photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Gagnon. Thus, the correct answer is (B) Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The photographers are Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  Each section must have exactly two photographs.
  There are three conditions that need to be fulfilled:
    1. For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
    2. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
    3. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then at least one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon or Hue, due to condition 2. However, none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so one of Fuentes's photographs must be in the Sports section to satisfy condition 3. This means that the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes which makes choice A and C false. The number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle is equal to the number of Fuentes photographs in Sports, so D and E are also false. Thus, the answer is B.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Total photographs: 6.
  - Photographs per section: 2.
  - Photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of his/her photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the only way to meet the condition of "at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section" is to have the other photograph in the Lifestyle section to be either by Fuentes, who can have other photographs in the Metro section, or by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- If the other photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, then Fuentes must have at least one other photograph in the Sports section to satisfy the condition "The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section." Therefore, Hue can have at most 2 photos, 1 in Lifestyle and 1 in Sports, while Gagnon can have at most 2 photos, both in Metro and Sports. Thus, Choice C is not possible while Choices A, B, D, and E are still possible.
- If the other photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, then we will have at least one photograph in Metro taken by Gagnon or Hue. If Gagnon has a photo in Metro, then he cannot have one in Sports. Therefore, Hue must have at least one photograph in Sports, and it cannot be two. Fuentes must have 1 photo in Sports, therefore he must have 2 photos in Lifestyle. At most 1 photo by Fuentes in Metro is possible, which means Hue can have one photo in Metro. One possible arrangement for the other photos is that Gagnon has the photo in Lifestyle that was not taken by Hue or Fuentes, and the other photo in Sports is taken by Hue. Thus, Choice B is the most likely answer.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  Three photographers are available: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  At least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear in each section.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Analysis: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have one or two photographs in both Synth and Lifestyle sections. This also means that Gagnon has one or two photographs in both Sports and Metro sections. Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, thus, Gagnon's both photographs are in the Metro section. Also, since Hue has no photograph in Sports, Hue must have two photographs in the Lifestyle section and Fuentes must have two photographs in the Sports section. Hence, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- There are 6 photographs in total; 2 in each of the 3 sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
- There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
- At least 1, but no more than 3, of each photographer's photographs must appear.
- At least one Lifestyle photograph must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle is equal to the number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the following must be true:
- At least one photograph by Fuentes must appear in Metro in order to satisfy the condition that at least one Lifestyle photograph is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- Both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue since the number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports.

A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. (It is possible, but not guaranteed)
B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon. (It is possible, but not guaranteed)
C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. (This is not possible since only 2 photographs per section are allowed)
D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. (It is possible, but not guaranteed)
E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. (This is not possible since both photographs cannot be by Hue according to the given conditions)
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - 6 photographs will be selected: exactly 2 photographs per section for the 3 given sections (Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports).
  - Each photographer must have at least one but no more than three photographs that are selected.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then at minimum one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon (because of the requirement in the Lifestyle section). However, none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Thus, the other photographer whose photograph appears in the Sports section must be either Fuentes or Hue. Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, if one photograph by Hue is selected for the Lifestyle section, then one photograph by Fuentes must be in the Sports section. Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, and the answer is B.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, Sports) must have exactly two of the available six photographs, in total there are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - No more than three of any one photographer's photographs may appear in the entire newspaper.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs appearing in Lifestyle section should be equal to the number of Fuentes photographs appearing in Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

Action: Answer("B") 

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then it is possible that both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes (one of the remaining photographers) , and as none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, then exactly one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon. So, choice B is true.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- A total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
- Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers.
- For each photographer, at least one but no more than three photographs of that photographer must appear.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
- One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
Action: Answer("A")  
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, that means that both the Metro and Sports sections must have either a Fuentes or a Gagnon photo, and there is no chance that the Sports section would have a photo by Hue. Therefore, it follows that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes, making choice A true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - A bakery makes exactly three types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each type of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch of cookies is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Answer("B")  

If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. This is because 3 batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made by Thursday, and since no two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day, one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday, and the answer is B.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are exactly three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - There are exactly three batches of each kind of cookie every week, for a total of nine batches.
  - Each batch is made from start to finish on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Solution:
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, and each kind of cookie has three batches, then we know that the following batches must be made on Wednesday: the third oatmeal, the third peanut butter, and the second sugar.
  - Since the first two batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on different days, and the only remaining day is Tuesday, we know that both of those batches must be made on Tuesday.
  - This leaves four batches (the third oatmeal, the third peanut butter, and the first and second sugar) to be made on Monday and Thursday.
  - Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, there must be at least 2 batches made on Monday, leaving only 2 batches for Thursday.
  - Therefore, Option D and Option E are incorrect.
  - Option A is incorrect because only one batch of cookies is made on Tuesday.
  - Option B is correct because all the remaining batches of cookies (which totals four) must be made on Friday.
  - So, the answer is Action: Answer("B").
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - A bakery makes exactly 3 kinds of cookies.
  - They make exactly 3 batches of each kind of cookie every week from Monday to Friday.
  - Each batch is made on a single day from start to finish.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  
Analysis:
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then:
    * Monday must have at least one batch of cookies
    * No other batch of cookie can be baked on Monday
    * No batch of cookie can be baked on Wednesday
    * On Thursday, the second batch of sugar cookies should be baked.
    * This would mean that all guaranteed batches of baking will have been completed
    * The baker will now have to make the last two batches of cookies on the remaining days, which are Tuesday and Friday.
    * Therefore, either 3 batches of cookies are made on Tuesday or 3 batches of cookies are made on Friday
    
Action: Answer("A") 
Therefore, the correct answer is A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The bakery makes exactly 3 kinds of cookies, and three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are exactly two batches of cookies made between Tuesday and Thursday.
  
  A: Cannot be true since the bakery only makes three batches of each kind of cookie per week.
  B: Cannot be true since the bakery only makes three batches of each kind of cookie per week.
  C: If only one batch of cookie is made on Monday, then at least 2 batches of the same cookie type have to be made on another day, to complete the total of 9 batches. Therefore, this statement is true.
  D: If only one batch of cookie is made on Monday, then at least 2 batches of the same cookie type have to be made on another day, to complete the total of 9 batches. This is not necessarily Thursday since the second batch of sugar cookies is already made on Thursday, which completes that day's baking. Therefore, this statement could be true but it is not always true.
  E: This statement cannot be determined from the given information.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. A total of 9 batches of cookies are made each week (3 kinds of cookies x 3 batches each).
  2. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  3. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  4. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  5. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
Analysis:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the 3rd batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday. Therefore, it must be made on either Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday. If it is made on Tuesday or Friday, then all three batches of oatmeal cookies would be made on the same day as one of the batches of another cookie kind, which violates condition 2. Thus, the 3rd batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday. Additionally, the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, which means no oatmeal or peanut butter cookies can be made on Thursday. Therefore, only one batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, and the remaining batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday and Friday in some order. 

Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies must be made on Friday.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
 The bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
 Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
 No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
 At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
 The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
 The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
 
Action: Answer("B")  
If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we know that there will be either two or three batches of cookies made on Friday. If only two batches of cookies were made on Friday, it would mean that all six of the remaining batches were made from Monday to Thursday, and that there would be two batches made on one of those days. However, the prompt states that no two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day, so this is impossible. Therefore, three batches of cookies must be made on Friday.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible schedules for the bakery.

Monday: oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar
Tuesday: oatmeal, sugar, peanut butter
Wednesday: none
Thursday: sugar, oatmeal, peanut butter
Friday: peanut butter, sugar, oatmeal

or

Monday: oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar
Tuesday: sugar, oatmeal, peanut butter
Wednesday: none
Thursday: peanut butter, sugar, oatmeal
Friday: sugar, oatmeal, peanut butter

Either way, the bakery always makes exactly three batches of each kind of cookies throughout the week. Therefore, the answer is NOT "A" and NOT "E".
Option "B" is not necessarily true since the schedule above showed that the bakery can make fewer than three batches of cookies on Friday.
Option "C" is false because we know that only one batch of cookies can be made on Monday because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
Option "D" is also false as we know that only one batch of sugar cookies is made on the same day as the other kinds of cookies. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Three kinds of cookie are made: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - Each batch of cookies is made, from start to finish, on a single day.

Action: Answer("B") 

If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be two remaining days where only two batches of cookies can be made, since there are nine total batches spread amongst Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Given that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, there can be no more than one batch of sugar cookies made on either Monday or Tuesday. Thus, if exactly two batches of sugar cookies are made by Friday, then all three batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday and Friday, respectively, in order to satisfy the remaining conditions. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies must be made on Friday. Answer B is correct.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - There are 3 types of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly 3 batches of each type of cookie are made each week, one batch per day.
  - No two batches of the same type of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, it means that there are:
  - 2 batches of cookies made on Tuesday
  - 1 batch of cookie made on Friday
  
Analysis:
  - Since the bakery makes exactly 3 types of cookies, they have to make exactly 3 batches each day from Monday to Friday. Thus, exactly 3 batches of cookies will be made on both Monday and Thursday.
  - From the given conditions, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which means both of these batches are made on either Monday, Tuesday, Thursday or Friday.
  - Since there are no two batches of the same type of cookie made on the same day, the second batch of sugar cookies must then be made on either Tuesday or Friday.
  - If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then one batch of cookie must be made on Friday. Thus, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  There are exactly three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookies are made each week.
  Each batch of cookies is made on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookies can be made on the same day.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  If Wednesday is not used, we need to figure out the schedules for the remaining days.
  
Analysis:
  First Batch of Oatmeal cookies can be made on either Monday or Tuesday.
  Second Batch of Oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of the Peanut butter cookies.
  Let's say the first batch of the oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Monday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  In this case, we have no cookies that can be made on Wednesday, but this requires the second batch of sugar cookies to be made on Wednesday, which is not allowed. Hence this option is invalid.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that the first batch of the oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Tuesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday. In this case, there are no cookies that can be made on Wednesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A teacher will assign each of five students—Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga—to exactly one of two research teams, the green team and the red team. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  There are two teams: green team with three members and red team with two members.
  One member in each team is a facilitator.
  Lateefah is in the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is on a different team than Olga.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - There are 5 students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  - There are 2 research teams: green and red.
  - One team has 2 members, and the other has 3 members.
  - One member of each team will be designated as a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
  
Using the given conditions:
  - Since Olga is a facilitator and Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, Juana cannot be a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team and since there can only be 1 facilitator for each team and Kelly is not a facilitator, Lateefah cannot be a facilitator.
  - Therefore, the green team facilitator must be Olga, and the red team facilitator is Kelly.
  - Also, since Juana is not a facilitator and Olga is, they cannot be on the same team. Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  
Action: Answer("A") - Juana is assigned to the red team.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  There are 5 students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  There are 2 teams: the green team and the red team.
  One team will have 2 members, the other team will have 3 members.
  One member of each team will be a facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
Action: Answer("C") 
Reasoning: Because Olga is a facilitator, she cannot be on the same team as Kelly, who is not a facilitator, so Olga must be assigned to the green team. Since Juana cannot be on the same team as Olga, Juana must be assigned to the red team. Lateefah is assigned to the green team and Kelly is not a facilitator, so Lateefah cannot be the facilitator on the green team. This leaves Mei and Lateefah as the possible facilitator candidates for the green team, and both Juana and Mei as the possible facilitator candidates for the red team. However, the prompt does not provide any information that would help us decide which of these students would be chosen as facilitator. Therefore, none of the other options need to be true.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The red team has either two or three members.
  The green team has either two or three members.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.

Considerations: 
  Since the red team has either two or three members, Lateefah is assigned to the team with two members, and Olga is assigned to the team with three members. 
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Kelly is on the green team. Therefore, the green team has exactly two members, and the other team is the red team. 
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, and Olga is a facilitator on the team with three members (the red team), so Juana is assigned to the green team, which has two members.
  Mei must then also be assigned to the red team, which would mean there are no facilitators on the green team.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are five students; Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  - There are two teams; the green team and the red team.
  - One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  - One member of each team will be designated as a facilitator.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.
  - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Solution:
  - Since Lateefah is already assigned to the green team and there are only two teams, the remaining team will have Juana, Kelly, Mei, and Olga in it.
  - Since Kelly is not a facilitator and Olga is a facilitator, Juana, Mei, and Olga will be the members of the red team, and Juana and Mei will not be facilitators.
  
  A: Juana may be assigned to the red team or the green team, so this must not be true.
  B: Lateefah is assigned to the green team, but being a facilitator or not being a facilitator is not specified, so this may or may not be true.
  C: Olga is a facilitator and is assigned to the red team, so this must not be true.
  D: Juana and Mei are both members of the red team, and since Kelly is not a facilitator and Olga is a facilitator, this must be true.
  E: Olga is a facilitator and Kelly is not a facilitator, but Juana may or may not be a facilitator, so this must not be true.

Therefore, the answer is D, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
  Two teams will be formed, with three members in one team and two members in the other team.
  One facilitator per team will be chosen. 
  Lateefah is on the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.

Analysis: Since Juana is assigned to the different team than Olga implies that Olga cannot be on red team because if Olga belongs to the red team then Juana should also be in the red team which contradicts the given statement. Lateefah is assigned to the green team already, so green team's facilitator must be from Lateefah, Juana or Olga. Kelly is not a facilitator and Olga is a facilitator, so Olga must be a facilitator of green team. Therefore, Olga must be assigned to the green team. Since Olga is on the green team, and Juana cannot be on the same team as Olga is, then Juana must be on the red team. Thus, Juana and Mei are both on the red team. Juana and Mei both can be either facilitators or non-facilitators.

Action: Answer("D")  
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- There are five students: Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga.
- There are two research teams: the green team and the red team.
- One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
- One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
- The assignment must satisfy the following conditions:
  - Juana is in a different team than Olga.
  - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  - Kelly is not a facilitator.
  - Olga is a facilitator.

Analysis:
- There must be a team with two students and a team with three students.
- Lateefah is assigned to the green team, so only 2 students remain for the red team (Juana, Kelly, Mei, Olivia).
- Olga is a facilitator and only one member per team can be a facilitator, so Olga is assigned to the team with 3 students.
- Juana is assigned to the team with 2 students.
- Kelly is not a facilitator, so Kelly is assigned to the green team. 
- Therefore, Mei should be assigned to the red team.

Action: Answer("C") - Olga is assigned to the green team.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

Analyzing each option:
  A: It could be possible, but not necessary.
  B: Lateefah will be a team member, but not a facilitator.
  C: Olga is a facilitator, but there's no way to know which team she was assigned to.
  D: Juana and Mei could both be facilitators if Juana is assigned to the red team.
  E: Kelly is not a facilitator and Juana could or could not be a facilitator.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  There are two teams (green and red). One has three members and the other has two.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  
Reasoning: Since Lateefah has to be assigned to the green team, and the green team already has a facilitator (Olga), Lateefah cannot be a facilitator. Therefore, Lateefah will be a regular member of the green team. Furthermore, since Olga is a facilitator, and Juana cannot be on the same team as Olga, Juana must be on the red team. Therefore, Mei must be on the green team. Finally, since Kelly is not a facilitator, and there is only one facilitator on each team, Kelly cannot be on Olga's team. Therefore, Kelly will be on the red team, which has only two members, and the red team's facilitator will be Mei. Since Juana is not a facilitator, the last statement must be true.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Two research teams.
  - One team will have two members, and the other will have three members.
  - One member of each team will be designated as facilitator.
  - The assignment must satisfy the following conditions:
    - Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
    - Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
    - Kelly is not a facilitator.
    - Olga is a facilitator.
   
  A: We do not know if Juana is assigned to the red team or not, so this option is not necessarily true.
  B: Lateefah is assigned to the green team, but it doesn't need to be a facilitator. Olga and Lateefah are already facilitators, so this option is not necessarily true.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team, but we don't know if she is a member or a facilitator of the team. There are two facilitators, so only one team will have a facilitator. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.
  D: There must be one team with two members and one facilitator and the other team with three members and two facilitators, so this option could be true. However, we need further information to confirm that this option is really true.
  E: Kelly is not a facilitator, and we do not know if Juana is a facilitator or not, so it is possible that neither Juana nor Kelly are facilitators. Therefore, this option could be true.

    3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning, and J must be shown in the evening, so K is shown between J and the afternoon showing, making this statement false.
  B: J has to be shown in the evening and L is shown after K, so L has to be shown after J in the evening. This statement is false.
  C: J must be shown in the evening, and P can be shown in the afternoon, thus this is the only statement that could be true. 
  D: This statement is impossible because there are only five houses to be shown in the
    afternoon.

  - L must be shown before M, and since K cannot be shown in the morning, then L must be shown after K.
  - P can be shown at any time, as long as J is shown in the evening.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  Since L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, and K cannot be shown in the morning. It follows that L must be shown at some time after J is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, choice B could be true.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The houses are shown in a particular sequence throughout the day, with the first two being shown in the morning, next three being shown after noon, and the last two being shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning. 
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown but before M is shown.
  
Analysis: 
  The correct choice should be one that follows the rules given while being possible based on the sequence of houses. 
  A: If K is shown at some time after J is shown, then J must be the first morning house, and K must be the sixth or seventh house. But K cannot be shown in the morning, so this choice is not possible.
  B: If L is shown at some time after J is shown, then J must be the first evening house, and L must be the seventh house. But L must be shown at some time before M is shown, so this choice is not possible.
  C: If P is shown at some time after J is shown, then J must be the first evening house, and P must be the seventh house. This choice is possible.
  D: If both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown, then M must be the fifth house, and N and O must be the sixth and seventh houses in some order. But L must be shown at some time before M is shown, so this choice is not possible.
  E: If both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown, then K must be shown in the morning, and N and P must be the sixth and seventh houses in some order. But J must be shown in the evening, so this choice is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses named J, K, L, M, N, O and P during one day. The first and second will be shown in the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth will be shown in the afternoon, and the sixth and seventh houses will be shown in the evening. 
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown after K and before M.
  
A: K must be shown either in the morning, or in the afternoon. J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, K cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. This option is incorrect.
B: L must be shown after K and before M. Thus, L cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. This option is incorrect.
C: J must be shown in the evening. P may be shown either in the morning, afternoon, or evening. Thus, this option could be true.
D: M must be shown in the afternoon, so it's highly improbable that both N and O will be shown at some time after M. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
E: N and P may be shown either in the morning, afternoon, or evening. Thus, both could be shown at some time after K. Therefore, this option could be true.

Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  1. J must be shown in the evening.
  2. K cannot be shown in the morning.
  3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  4. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  5. The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  6. The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.

A: If K is shown at some time after J, then K cannot be shown in the morning. This contradicts rule 4, which states that the first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
B: If L is shown at some time after J, then K must be shown before L and K cannot be shown in the morning. This means that K must be shown in the afternoon. However, rule 4 states that the first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
C: P can be shown at some time after J as long as it is not shown in the morning. Rule 6 states that the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. Therefore, P can be shown in the evening. This choice is possible.
D: If both N and O are shown at some time after M, then at least one of them must be shown in the evening. However, rule 6 states that the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
E: If both N and P are shown at some time after K, then K cannot be shown in the morning. This contradicts rule 4, which states that the first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The realtor will show seven houses: J, K, L, M, N, O, P, in a specific order and time of day.
  J must be shown in the evening, which means 6th or 7th.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown after K but before M.

A: If K is shown after J, then it will have to be the 6th or 7th house which violates the constraint that K cannot be shown in the morning.
B: If L is shown after J, J would have to be one of the first two houses shown, and this violates the condition that J must be shown in the evening.
C: P could be shown after J, which means that J would have to be the 1st or 2nd house, P would have to be the 6th or 7th house.
D: It's not possible for both N and O to be shown after M because there are no time slots available, all three slots are taken up by L, M, and N.
E: Both N and P could be shown after K, which means that K would have to be the 1st or 2nd house shown, N and P would have to be the 6th or 7th house.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  We need to determine which one of the given choices can be true based on the following information:
  - J is shown in the evening.
  - K cannot be shown in the morning.
  - L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  - The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  - The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  
Analysis:
  According to the given rules, we know that J is shown in the evening, which means that the first two houses cannot be J. Also, K cannot be shown in the morning, which means that K is shown in the afternoon or evening. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, which means that L is shown in the afternoon or evening. Applying these rules, we can eliminate some of the choices:
  - A cannot be true because K cannot be shown after J, as J is shown in the evening.
  - B can be true because L must be shown after K and before M, which means that it can be shown after J based on the given information.
  - C cannot be true because P is the last house to be shown, which means that it is shown in the evening, and J must be shown in the evening as well, so it can't be after J.
  - D cannot be true because there are only seven houses to be shown, which means that at most only one of N and O can be shown after M.
  - E cannot be true because one of N or P is shown in the morning, and K cannot be shown in the morning.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The first two houses are shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses are shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses are shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

A: If K is shown after J is shown, which means K would be shown in the afternoon or in the evening. However, K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, A is not possible.
B: L has to be shown in between K and M. If L is shown after J, which means K and L both will be shown in the afternoon or evening. In the given rules, K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, B is not possible.
C: P can be shown anytime during the day. Therefore, C is possible.
D: This cannot be true as it is not possible to show more than one house in the evening.
E: This cannot be true as N and P both cannot be shown at some time after K is shown.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - There are three periods in which the realtor will show the houses: morning, afternoon, and evening. 
  - The first and second houses to be shown will be in the morning, the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be in the afternoon, and the sixth and seventh houses will be in the evening.
  - J must be shown in the evening, which means that at least one of the houses, K, L, M, N, O, and P, must be shown in the morning or in the afternoon.
  - K cannot be shown in the morning, which means it must be shown in the afternoon or in the evening.
  - L must be shown at some time after K is shown, and at some time before M is shown.
  
Answering each choice:
  A: If K were shown after J is shown, then K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. However, we are told that K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: If L were shown after J is shown, then K must be shown in the morning, and that violates the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: This could be true. Since J is shown in the evening, P could be shown in the morning, afternoon, or evening.
  D: We know that L must be shown at some time before M is shown. Therefore, it is not possible for N and O to be shown after M.
  E: If N and P were shown at some time after K, then K must be shown in the afternoon or evening. However, we know that K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, E cannot be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The realtor will show seven houses, J, K, L, M, N, O, and P, during a single day.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  
Analysis:
  Option A: If K is shown at some time after J is shown, it will violate the rule that J must be shown in the evening. Hence, option A cannot be true.
  Option B: If L is shown at some time after J is shown, it may or may not violate any rule. Hence, option B could be true.
  Option C: If P is shown at some time after J is shown, it may or may not violate any rule. Hence, option C could be true.
  Option D: The rules do not imply anything about N and O to be shown after M is shown. Hence, option D could be true.
  Option E: If both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown, it will violate the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning. Hence, option E cannot be true.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
- To get a class 2 building in return, Trustcorp can trade only a class 2 building or one of its class 1 buildings.
- Since we know that Trustcorp does not own any class 2 buildings after some trades, Trustcorp has traded away all of its class 2 buildings.
- Therefore, Trustcorp has traded one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings (because it cannot trade a class 2 building for a class 1 building). 

Action:
- Answer("C") 
- Southco must have traded with Trustcorp because it is the only one with class 2 buildings and now Trustcorp does not have any class 2 building after trades.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  - Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  - Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  - Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  - Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
Analysis:
  - Trustcorp owns only one class 1 building, the only possible scenario when a class 1 building may be traded for it are when Southco trades Flores Tower.
  - Southco needs a class 1 building to trade it for Flores Tower, the only possible one for it to trade is Garza Tower owned by RealProp.
  - Therefore, RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower).
  - Southco owns Lynch Building, a class 2 building and did not trade it for any other building yet, so option B cannot be true.
  - There is no indication to support option C.
  - Trustcorp cannot own Garza Tower (class 1) as it belongs to RealProp.
  - Trustcorp cannot own Zimmer House (class 3) since RealProp owns it.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns 1 class 1 building, 2 class 3 building
  Southco owns 1 class 1 building, 1 class 2 building
  Trustcorp owns 3 class 2 buildings
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.

Action: 
- If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it means that they have to trade away all of their class 2 buildings.
- Trustcorp had traded one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, they will now own only class 1 and class 3 buildings.
- Southco has only 1 class 2 building, so it is impossible for Trustcorp to trade with Southco without having a class 2 building.
- RealProp also has no class 2 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp has to either trade with Realprop or exchange one of their class 1 buildings for two class 2 buildings.
- Zimmer House is the only class 3 building owned by RealProp, so they cannot exchange it for a class 2 building.
- Therefore, RealProp must own a class 1 building which Trustcorp can trade for two class 2 buildings.
- This means that Trustcorp does not own Garza Tower, otherwise they could have traded the Garza Tower with Realprop for two class 2 buildings.
- Also, Trustcorp cannot own Zimmer House as it is a class 3 building.
- Therefore, Trustcorp must own the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building, which are both class 2 buildings.
- This means that Answer("E") Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House is incorrect as Trustcorp cannot own any class 3 buildings. Answer("D") Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower is also incorrect since Trustcorp does not have any class 1 buildings to trade for two class 2 buildings.
- Answer("A") RealProp owns a class 1 building is correct since Trustcorp needs to trade with RealProp to get two class 2 buildings, and RealProp has one class 1 building, Garza Tower.
- Answer("C") Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp is incorrect because Trustcorp has no class 2 buildings to trade with Southco.
- Answer("B") Southco owns only class 2 buildings is incorrect because Southco owns both class 1 building and class 2 building. 

Therefore, the correct answer is Answer("A").
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    * Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    * Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    * Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
 
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings, it has to trade at least one of the buildings it owns, which are all class 2 buildings. Since there is no trade type that involves trading one class 2 building for one building of the same class, Trustcorp must trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. Thus, Trustcorp must own either the Garza Tower or the Yates House. Since RealProp owns the Garza Tower, Trustcorp must own the Zimmer House (class 3), which is option E.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  RealProp's buildings are:
    Garza Tower (class 1)
    Yates House (class 3)
    Zimmer House (class 3)
  Southco's buildings are:
    Flores Tower (class 1)
    Lynch Building (class 2)
  Trustcorp's buildings are:
    King Building (class 2)
    Meyer Building (class 2)
    Ortiz Building (class 2)
  Trades must be of exactly one of the following types:
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  
  A: There is no information about RealProp's ownership of class 1 buildings.
  B: Southco owns a class 1 and a class 2 building, so this option is not true.
  C: There is not enough information to answer this question.
  D: There is no information to determine whether Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: RealProp owns the Zimmer House, not the Trustcorp.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower), and two class 3 buildings (Yates House and Zimmer House).
  Southco owns a class 1 building (Flores Tower) and a class 2 building (Lynch Building).
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings (King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building).
  Each trade must include only one of the three possible trade types.
  Trustcorp owns no class 2 building after some trades.
  
  To trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, Trustcorp needs to own a class 2 building, but we know Trustcorp does not own any class 2 buildings after some trades. Therefore, option (E) is not possible.
  
  RealProp only has one class 1 building. If RealProp trades its class 1 building, then it will not have any class 1 buildings left. Therefore, option (A) is not possible.
  
  Southco has one class 1 building (Flores Tower) and one class 2 building (Lynch Building). Southco can only trade the class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or the class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. If Southco only makes trades that involve its class 2 building, then it will still have at least one class 2 building left. Therefore, option (B) is not possible.
  
  If Southco makes any trade with Trustcorp, then it must involve Trustcorp's class 2 buildings. However, we know that Trustcorp does not own any class 2 buildings after some trades. Therefore, option (C) is not possible.
  
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. If Trustcorp trades one of these buildings, then it will not have any class 2 buildings left. Therefore, option (D) must be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Trades are allowed only among buildings of the same classes or among buildings qualified under the three given conditions.
  
If Trustcorp owns no class 2 building after some number of trades, then it cannot have traded  a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.

This means that Trustcorp has either traded one of their class 2 buildings for a building of another class (class 1 or 3), per the first option, or it has traded a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, per the second option. 

Knowledge:
  If Trustcorp trades a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, RealProp must trade a class 2 building for a class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for a class 1 or 3 building, Southco must trade a class 2 building for a building of a different class.

Therefore, Southco must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp. Additionally, if Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for a building of class 1, then RealProp must own a class 2 building. Thus, the only guaranteed statements are: 
   Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Trustcorp owns 3 class 2 buildings.
  - Trades involve buildings of the same class, or class 1 building for two class 2, or class 2 for two class 3.

Analysis:
  - In order for Trustcorp to end up with no class 2 building, it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings away.
  - In any two-for-three trade, Trustcorp could only offer up one building, at most, which means Trustcorp must have made at least two different trades involving its class 2 buildings.

Action: Answer("C")  (Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.)
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Trustcorp owns all class 2 buildings initially.
  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building from the start.
  B: Southco can trade its Lynch Building for two class 3 buildings, but it will still have a class 2 building. Therefore, B is false.
  C: Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building to Southco in order for Southco to have a class 1 building to trade with RealProp. Therefore, C is true.
  D: RealProp owns the Garza Tower, not Trustcorp. Therefore, D is false.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building, neither of which is a class 3 building. Therefore, Trustcorp cannot have a class 3 building. Therefore, E is false.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class, trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or trading one class 2 building fpr two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (Class 1), Yates House (Class 3), and Zimmer House (Class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (Class 1) and Lynch Building (Class 2).
  
Action: Answer("C") 

If TrustCorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then all of its class 2 buildings must have been traded away. The only company that owns class 2 buildings is Trustcorp and the only types of trades that involve class 2 buildings are trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings or trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. Therefore, Trustcorp must have made at least one trade with either RealProp or Southco, so the correct answer is (C) Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Six bands: Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  Slots numbered from 1 to 6.
  Constraints:
    * Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
    * Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
    * Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    * Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then there is only one valid slot order (Zircon must perform in the earliest slot). 
  A: If Uneasy performs in slot five, then slot six would be empty, which violates the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. So, option A is not possible.
  B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in a later slot than Vegemite (due to the constraint that Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite), which means that Wellspring and Xpert would perform in slots one and two, respectively. Then, Uneasy could not perform in a later slot than Xpert, which violates the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. So, option B is not possible. 
  C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then either Xpert or Zircon would have to perform in slot one (since both must perform in earlier slots than Wellspring), which means that Vegemite would have to perform in slot two or earlier. This violates the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. So, option C is not possible.
  D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then there is only one possible slot order that satisfies all constraints (Wellspring in slot one, Xpert in slot three, Uneasy in slot four, Vegemite in slot five, and Zircon in slot two). So, option D is possible.
  E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then one of the following must be true:
    * Wellspring performs in slot one (since Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon)
    * Xpert performs in slot one (since both Wellspring and Zircon must perform in earlier slots than Xpert)
    * Vegemite performs in slot three (since Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, and slots one and two are already taken by Wellspring and Xpert).
    However, this does not leave enough slots for Uneasy and Yardsign to perform, which violates the constraints that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots and Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. So, option E is not possible.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  1. Six bands (Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon) will perform in slots one through six.
  2. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  3. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  4. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  5. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  6. Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
Logic: 
  From constraint (3), we know that Zircon and Wellspring each performs in an earlier slot than Xpert. So, if Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Zircon must perform in one of the first three slots. That eliminates options (A) and (E). Then, from constraint (2), we know that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Thus, we can eliminate option (D) . Now, since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, that means one of those slots must be Vegemite or Yardsign. Thus, by elimination, we can choose option (B). 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The slots are numbered from 1 to 6.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, there are only two possible positions for Wellspring and Xpert: either (3,4) or (4,5).
  
Analysis:
  - Option A contradicts the fact that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots as slot 5 is not among the last three slots.
  - Option B also contradicts the fact that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, as Vegemite cannot perform before slot 2 if Zircon performs in slot 4 or later.
  - Option C is possible if Wellspring is in slot 3 and Xpert is in slot 4.
  - Option D contradicts the fact that Wellspring should perform immediately before Xpert if Zircon is in slot 2.
  - Option E is not possible, as Zircon should perform before Xpert, which cannot happen if Xpert is in slot 5 and Zircon is in slot 4.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
 - Vegemite needs to perform an earlier slot than Zircon.
 - Wellspring and Zircon both play earlier than Xpert.
 - Uneasy plays one of the last three slots, while Yardsign plays in one of the first three slots. 

Action: 
 - If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Xpert must play slot 6 and Wellspring must play slot 5. 
 - Since Uneasy can play in any of the three final slots, option A could be true. 
 - Since Yardsign has to play in one of the three first slots, it cannot be B, C, D, or E.
Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Vegemite < Zircon, implication: Zircon performs at slot 5 or 6.
- Wellspring < Xpert < Zircon, implies that the order would be: W X Z.
- Uneasy performs in slot 4, 5, or 6.
- Yardsign performs in slot 1, 2, or 3.

Analysis:
- If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then there is only one possible arrangement: Wellspring in slot 4, Xpert in slot 5, and Zircon in slot 6.
- Since Yardsign must be in one of the first slots, and Vegemite < Zircon, Vegemite could not perform in slot three.
- Uneasy must perform in slot 4, 5, or 6, eliminating choice (A).
- Zircon must be in slot 6, eliminating choices (D) and (E).

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The order of the six bands: Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, Zircon and Uneasy.
  The following constraints must be met:
    - Vegemite performs earlier than Zircon.
    - Wellspring and Zircon each perform earlier than Xpert.
    - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
    - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.

If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then:
- Wellspring must perform in slot two (since it performs before Xpert and cannot perform in slot one).
- Xpert must perform in slot three (since they perform immediately after Wellspring).
- Vegemite must perform in slot one (since it performs earlier than Zircon).
- Zircon cannot perform in slot two (since Wellspring performs in slot two and it performs before Xpert).
- Yardsign cannot perform in slot two or three (since Wellspring and Zircon perform earlier than Xpert).

Therefore, the only option that could be true is option A: Uneasy performs in slot five.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then it is like W - X.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, that is, slot four, five, or six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, that is, slot one, two, or three.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring, Zircon, and Xpert each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  
Analysis:
  If W - X, then:
  - Uneasy needs to occupy either slot four, five, or six.
  - One of the two slots that Zircon can occupy must be slot six, which means that Vegemite should perform in either slot two, three, or four.
  - Slot one must be either Yardsign or Vegemite based on previous constraint. Thus, the earliest that both Wellspring and Zircon can perform in is slot two.

A: Uneasy performs in slot five. - Impossible, Uneasy would then perform after Xpert.
B: Vegemite performs in slot three. - Possible, if Zircon performs in slot six, Xpert in slot five, Uneasy in slot four, Wellspring in slot two and Yardsign in slot one.
C: Wellspring performs in slot three. - Impossible, Vegemite must occupy slot three for this to be true.
D: Zircon performs in slot two. - Impossible, Zircon needs to perform in slot six.
E: Zircon performs in slot four. - Impossible, Zircon needs to perform in slot six and Xpert in slot five.

Action: Answer("B") - Vegemite performs in slot three.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  2. Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots.
  3. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  4. If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order could be: [Yardsign], [Wellspring or Zircon], [Wellspring or Zircon], [Xpert], and [Uneasy or Vegemite or Zircon]. Note that Uneasy could perform in slots 4, 5 or 6. 
  
Analysis:
  If Wellspring is immediately before Xpert, then slot 4 must be filled by Xpert. Also, slots 2 and 3 must be filled by Wellspring and Zircon in some order, and the sixth slot must be filled by Uneasy, Vegemite, or Zircon.
  
  A. If Uneasy performs in slot 5, then the last slot must be filled by either Vegemite or Zircon. But according to the constraints, Yardsign must perform in at least one of the first three slots.
  
  B. If Vegemite performs in slot 3, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots 1 and 2, in some order. But then Yardsign must perform in the sixth slot, which contradicts the constraints.
  
  C. If Wellspring performs in slot 3, then Zircon must perform in slot 2 and Xpert must perform in slot 4. The rest of the slots must be filled by Yardsign, Vegemite and Uneasy, in some order. This is a possible arrangement, therefore the answer is C.
  
  D. If Zircon performs in slot 2, then Wellspring must perform in slot 1, Xpert must perform in slot 4, and Zircon must perform before Vegemite. But then Yardsign cannot perform in one of the first three slots.
  
  E. If Zircon performs in slot 4, then Wellspring must perform in slot 1 or 2, and Xpert must perform in slot 5 or 6. But then there is no possible slot left for Uneasy or Vegemite.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  According to the constraints given in the question:
  - Vegemite performs before Zircon
  - Wellspring and Zircon perform before Xpert
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots
  
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, we can assume that the slots are filled in this order: ??WXP??
  
  From the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, we know that one of the first three slots is not available for Wellspring, Zircon, or Xpert.
  
  From the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, we know that one of the first three slots must be allocated to Uneasy.
  
  Therefore, the only available slot for Wellspring is slot 4 while slot 5 and 6 are reserved for Uneasy and Zircon respectively.
  
  A: Uneasy cannot perform in slot 5 because it is reserved for Zircon.
  B: Vegemite cannot perform in slot 3 because it is reserved for Uneasy, Zircon or Wellspring.
  C: Wellspring can perform in slot 3.
  D: Zircon cannot perform in slot 2 because it is reserved for Wellspring.
  E: Zircon must perform in slot 6.

Action: Answer("C") 
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The slots are numbered slot one through slot six.
  - The bands are Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon.
  - Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  - Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  - Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  
If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, we know that:
- Wellspring must perform in either slot one or slot two.
- Xpert must perform in either slot five or slot six.
- Vegemite cannot perform in slot six.
- Zircon cannot perform in slot one.

Analysis of the choices:
A: If Uneasy performs in the fifth slot, then Zircon must perform in slot six, but this is not possible as Zircon is supposed to perform earlier than Xpert. Therefore this is not a valid option.
B: If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slot one and slot two, respectively. This satisfies all the constraints, so this is a possible order.
C: If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot two, but this is not possible as Zircon is supposed to perform earlier than Xpert. Therefore this is not a valid option.
D: If Zircon performs in slot two, then Wellspring must perform in slot one and Xpert must perform in slot five. This is possible if Vegemite performs in slot four and Uneasy performs in slot six. Therefore, this is a possible order.
E: If Zircon performs in slot four, then Xpert must perform in slot five. However, this is not possible since Zircon is supposed to perform earlier than Xpert. Therefore, this is not a valid option.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to any of the countries, Kayne would also be assigned as an ambassador.
  If Landon is assigned as ambassador, it would be to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The ambassadors will be assigned to three countries: Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia.
  Each country will be assigned to one ambassador only.
  Only one ambassador can be assigned to each country.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, will be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as an ambassador, then Kayne will be assigned as an ambassador too.
  If Ong is assigned as an ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne will not be assigned as an ambassador to Yemen.
  Landon will only be assigned as an ambassador to Zambia.

Action: Answer("A")  

Explanation: 
If Ong is assigned as an ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne will not be assigned to Yemen. 
If Jaramillo is not assigned as an ambassador, then Kayne will also not be assigned as an ambassador, and Novetzke must be assigned as an ambassador.
If Jaramillo is assigned as an ambassador, then Kayne must also be assigned as an ambassador, and Novetzke cannot be assigned.
Therefore, if Ong is assigned as an ambassador to Venezuela, the remaining ambassadors must be Jaramillo and Landon.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  
Analysis: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This means that either Jaramillo or Novetzke must be assigned as an ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned can be chosen from the remaining candidates, who are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, and Novetzke. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Kayne is already assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, he cannot be assigned as ambassador to any of the other two countries, so Jaramillo and Novetzke would have to be assigned to the remaining countries. If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to either Yemen or Zambia, then Jaramillo would have to be assigned as ambassador to the remaining country. If Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to either Yemen or Zambia, then Jaramillo would have to be assigned as ambassador to the remaining country.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  - If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador, then Kayne is also assigned as ambassador.
  - If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  - If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, have to be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.

Action: 
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela:
  - From the fifth constraint, we know that one of the ambassadorships has to go to either Kayne or Novetzke.
  - From the fourth constraint, we know that Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen, so Kayne should be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia.
  - From the second constraint, if Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned. This means that the third ambassadorship would be assigned to either Landon or Novetzke.
Solving the constraints, we have two possible solutions:
  1. Ong (Venezuela), Jaramillo (Yemen), and Landon (Zambia)
  2. Ong (Venezuela), Kayne (Zambia), and Novetzke (Yemen)
  
Therefore, the answer is either A or D, but since the question asks for "the other two ambassadors assigned," the most complete answer is "Kayne and Landon," so the correct choice is C: Kayne and Landon.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as an ambassador to any country, then Kayne is assigned as an ambassador to some country.
  If Landon is assigned as an ambassador, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  
Analysis:
  Since Ong must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, it is not possible for Kayne to be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. So, if Kayne is assigned as an ambassador, it should be either to Venezuela or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned as an ambassador, then Kayne must be assigned as an ambassador as well. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne will be assigned as ambassadors to these two countries. That leaves Zambia for Landon and either Yemen or Venezuela for Novetzke. However, since Kayne is not assigned as an ambassador to Yemen because Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Novetzke must be assigned as an ambassador to Yemen, and Landon will be assigned as an ambassador to Zambia.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to the same country (if Jaramillo is assigned).
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as the ambassador to Yemen.
  Landon is assigned to Zambia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The possible candidates for each ambassadorship are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Action: Answer("E") 
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then we know that Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen, but we don't know if Kayne or Novetzke will be assigned to the other vacancy. We also know that Landon will be assigned to Zambia, and if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, Kayne will be assigned to another ambassadorship. Thus, the remaining candidates for the other two ambassadorships could be Jaramillo and Novetzke. Therefore, the answer is (E) Landon and Novetzke.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Ong cannot be assigned to any other ambassadorship, as he must be assigned to Venezuela, according to the problem constraint.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as an ambassador.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne is assigned to either Zambia or Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, Landon cannot be assigned as an ambassador to Venezuela or Yemen.
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.

Analysis:
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne is assigned to Zambia. Then, either Novetzke or Jaramillo is assigned to either Yemen or Zambia. But if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne, which means Jaramillo cannot be assigned as an ambassador to Yemen. Thus, Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen, and Jaramillo must be assigned to Zambia. Therefore, the answer is A: Jaramillo and Landon.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The candidates for the ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong.
  One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.
  Constraints:
    * Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
    * If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
    * If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
    * If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. From the constraints, Kayne must be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. So Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to two of the ambassadorships. Landon is assigned to the remaining ambassadorship, which must be Zambia. This leaves Novetzke as the only remaining candidate, who must be assigned to the remaining ambassadorship. Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Kayne and Landon.

    - Choice D: The Sports section has one photograph by Fuentes and one photograph by Hue, but it is not possible to have both photographs by Gagnon in the Metro section and none in the Lifestyle or Sports section. Thus, this selection is not acceptable.
    - Choice E: The Lifestyle section has one photograph from Gagnon and one photograph from Hue. The Metro section has both photographs by Hue. The Sports section has one photograph by Fuentes and one photograph by Hue. This selection does not follow the requirement that the Lifestyle section has at least one photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, so it is not acceptable. 

Answer: Answer("B")

  -Six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section.
  -There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  -No more than three photographs per photographer can be selected and no fewer than one photograph can be selected per photographer.
  -At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  -The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  -None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

A: Both of Fuentes photographs are in Lifestyle, but there is only one of Hue's in Metro, which violates the constraint, and there is only one photograph by Gagnon, which violates the constraint.
B: Each photographer has only two photographs, there is one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon in Lifestyle, which satisfies the constraint, there is one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon in Metro, which satisfies the constraint, and there are both photographs by Hue in Sports, which satisfies the constraint.
C: None of Gagnon's photographs are in Sports, so this is a violation.
D: Fuentes is the photographer with photographs in Sports. Neither photograph in Sports is by Fuentes. This is a violation.
E: This selection meets all of the constraints.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  - Six different photographs will appear, two per section, across three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports.
  - Three photographers are involved: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of their photographs can appear.
  - There must be at least one photograph in Lifestyle by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in Sports.
  - No Gagnon photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
Solution:
  - From the choices provided, we need to select the one that satisfies all the given conditions.
  - We know Gagnon photos can't be in Sports, so options A and D are not valid.
  
  - Let's look at option B: 
    Lifestyle: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon
    Metro: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon
    Sports: both photographs by Hue
    - This seems valid because we have photographs from each photographer appearing in Lifestyle and Metro. Gagnon is present in Lifestyle, so we don't need to worry about photographer presence in Sports. The number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle is the same as Fuentes' photos in Sports. So, it satisfies all given conditions.
  
  - Let's look at option C:
    Lifestyle: both photographs by Fuentes
    Metro: both photographs by Gagnon
    Sports: both photographs by Hue
    - This option doesn't satisfy the condition that there has to be a photographer in Lifestyle who has at least one photo in Metro.

  - Option E:
    Lifestyle: one photograph by Gagnon and one by Hue
    Metro: both photographs by Hue
    Sports: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue
    - This option doesn't satisfy the condition that the number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle has to be the same as Fuentes' photos in Sports.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Three photographers (Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue) and six photographs.
  In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections, there are two photographs per section and a total of six photographs.
  Each photographer must have at least one photograph but not more than three.
  At least one photograph in Lifestyle should have a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section should be as much as Fuentes's photos in the Sports section.
  No Gagnon photograph should be in the Sports section.
  
Elimination:
  - Choice A: Acceptable
  - Choice B: Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section are not the same as Fuentes's in the Sports. Not acceptable.
  - Choice C: Hue has three photographs in total, which means he must have more than one photograph out of the Metro section. Not acceptable.
  - Choice D: Gagnon should not have any photographs in the Sports section. Not acceptable.
  - Choice E: Hue is in two sections and has three total photos, which means he should also have a photo in the Sports section. Not acceptable.

### Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - On day 1, Greyhound is featured. 
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
Analysis:
- Choice A: Greyhounds and Siamese cannot be both featured on day 2, as no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
- Choice B: Greyhounds are featured on day 1, which means that they cannot be featured on day 7. Moreover, Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1 and must be featured on exactly three days, not including day 1.
- Choice C: Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, so they cannot be featured on day 4.
- Choice D: Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5 because they cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans. Manx cannot be featured on day 5 because no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
- Choice E: Newfoundlands and Manx can both be featured on day 6. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Option A: 
- Greyhounds are on day 1, so they are not on day 2.
- Himalayans cannot be on day 2, as it would mean they would also need to be on day 4 and day 6 but not on day 7, which is not possible.
- If Greyhounds are not on day 2, the only way Siamese could be on day 2 is if they are also on day 4 and day 6, but this violates the rule that no breed is featured on consecutive days, so this option is not possible.

Option B: 
- Greyhounds are on day 1 so they cannot be on day 7.
- Himalayans cannot be on day 1, so they could be on day 7.
- It is possible that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but this requires Himalayans to also be on day 4 and day 6 and nowhere else, which is possible under the given rules.
- This option is possible.

Option C: 
- Himalayans are not on day 1 but can be featured on day 2 and day 4; this means they cannot be featured on day 3.
- If Himalayans are on day 4 and neither Newfoundlands nor Manx is featured on day 4, then both must be on day 3 and day 5, which violates the rule that no breed is featured on consecutive days, so this option is not possible.

Option D: 
- Rottweilers and Himalayans cannot share a day.
- Rottweilers are not on day 7 or any day where Himalayans are featured, so Rottweilers could be on day 5.
- If Rottweilers are on day 5, then Manx and Himalayans cannot be on day 4, as this would mean both must also be featured on day 2 and day 6, violating the rule that no breed is featured on consecutive days.
- Therefore, it is possible that Manx are on day 4, making this option possible.

Option E: 
- We know there must be a puppy on day 6 since there cannot be two consecutive days without a breed, and there was a breed on day 5.
- Rottweilers cannot be on day 6 since they cannot share a day with Manx, who must be on day 5 or day 7 in this scenario.
- Greyhounds cannot be on day 6, so this option is not possible.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  * There are exactly 3 types of kitten breeds and exactly 3 types of puppy breeds.
  * Each day, one type of kitten and one type of puppy are featured.
  * Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  * No breed is features on two consecutive days.
  * Any breed can be on day 1, but cannot be on day 7.
  * Himalayans are featured on exactly 3 days, but not day 1.
  * Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 nor featured with Himalayans.
  
Analysis:
  * Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  * No breed can be featured on day 2.
  * Since a breed cannot be featured on two consecutive days, the possible breed features for day 3 are: Himalayan-Siamese-Manx, Newfoundland-Siamese-Manx, and Greyhound-Himalayan-Manx.
  * If Himalayans are featured on day 3, then the possible breeds features for day 4 are: Greyhound-Newfoundland-Manx, Siamese-Newfoundland-Manx, or Greyhound-Siamese-Manx. Thus, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4. However, if a breed different from Himalayans is featured on day 3, then the possible breeds featured on day 4 are: Greyhound-Newfoundland-Manx, Greyhound-Siamese-Manx, or Siamese-Newfoundland-Manx. Thus, Rottweilers can be featured on day 4.
  * If Himalayans are featured on day 3, then the possible breeds features for day 5 are: Greyhound-Newfoundland-Siamese. Thus, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5. However, if a breed different from Himalayans is featured on day 3, then the possible breeds featured on day 5 are: Greyhound-Newfoundland-Siamese, Siamese-Greyhound-Manx, or Newfoudland-Greyhound-Manx. Thus, Rottweilers can be featured on day 5.
  * If Himalayans are featured no day 3, then they can be featured on days 4, 5, and 6. If Rottweilers are featured on day 4, then they cannot be featured on day 5. If Rottweilers are featured on day 5, then they cannot be featured on day 6.
  
Action: Answer("D")  Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5. This is possible if Himalayans are not featured on day 3, and Siamese and Newfoundland are featured on day 3 and day 4 in any order.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  There are exactly seven consecutive days as day 1 though day 7.
  There are three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—, and three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler.
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Solution:
  Using the given information,
  - Greyhounds featured on day 1, so none of the other breeds could be featured on day 1.
  - Greyhounds cannot be featured again on any consecutive day.
  - The breed featured on day 1 cannot be featured again on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

  A: On day 2, only one breed of kitten and one breed of puppy can be featured, and these breeds cannot be greyhound and Siamese respectively. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
  B: Himalayans cannot be on day 1 and 7, but they need to be on three days. Therefore, Greyhounds and Himalayans cannot be featured on the same day. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
  C: Himalayans are not on day 1 and are on exactly three days. Therefore, Himalayans could be featured on any combination of (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
     - If Himalayans are featured on day 4, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 3, and that leaves only breed left to be featured on day 3 is Newfoundland. Therefore, this choice could be true.
  D: Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
  E: Newfoundlands cannot be featured on the consecutive days that greyhounds are not featured. Therefore, Newfoundlands cannot be featured on day 6. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1. 
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. 
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. 
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. 
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. 

Analysis: 
- Choice A contradicts both "No breed is featured on any two consecutive days" and "Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7." So, it cannot be true. 
- Choice B seems to contradict "Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7." Thus, it cannot be true. 
- Choice C contradicts that "Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans." Thus, it cannot be true. 
- Choice D contradicts Greyhound being featured on day 1 since Manx appears on day 4. So, it cannot be true. 
- Choice E does not contradict any of the given conditions and can be true. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Analysis:
  From the rules, we can conclude that on Day 1, the breed featured is Greyhounds. Thus, on Day 2, none of the breed shown on Day 1 is allowed to be featured, which excludes Greyhounds. Therefore, Option (A) is impossible. On Day 7, none of the breed shown on Day 1 is allowed to be featured, which excludes Greyhounds. Also, Himalayans are not featured on day 1, which means Himalayans can be shown on day 7. Thus, option (B) is possible. On day 4 or later, it is possible to feature Himalayans. If Himalayans are shown on day 4, then Rottweilers cannot be shown on day 4 or any day that features Himalayans. This excludes option (C). If Rottweilers are shown on day 5, then they cannot be shown on day 7. Since they cannot appear at all on day 7, Rottweilers cannot appear at all on the last three days. This excludes option (D). Thus, option (B) is the only possible choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - There are 3 kitten breeds (Himalayan, Manx, Siamese) and 3 puppy breeds (Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler).
  - Each kitten and puppy breed is featured once on each of the 7 consecutive days.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so no other breed is featured on that day.
  - No breed can be featured on any consecutive days, which means breeds featured on day 1 and day 2 cannot appear together.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A: Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so no kitten breed is featured with Greyhounds on day 2. So, this cannot be true.
B: Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7. This cannot be true.
C: Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, so they cannot be featured on day 1 or day 7. Rottweilers cannot be featured on a day when Himalayans are featured. So, if Himalayans are featured on days 2 and 3, then Rottweilers can be featured on day 4 along with the other available kitten breed Manx. This could be true.
D: We cannot have Rottweilers on day 5 since this conflicts with the condition that no breed can be featured on two consecutive days. This cannot be true.
E: Since we already have Manx on day 5 and no breed can be featured on two consecutive days, Manx cannot appear on day 6. This cannot be true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - There are total of 3 breeds of kittens and 3 breeds of puppies.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. 
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  
Let's check the validity of each option:
  A: If Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2, then on day 3 neither Himalayans nor Rottweilers could be featured because both would break the condition. But then on day 4 the only breeds remaining are Himalayans and Rottweilers, and they cannot be featured together so this is impossible.
  B: If Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7 that means day 1 must have featured Newfoundland and day 6 must have featured Greyhounds. So Himalayans could be featured on days 2, 3 & 4 and Rottweilers could be featured on days 5, 6 & 7. This satisfies all the conditions.
  C: If Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4, that means day 3 must have featured Greyhounds and day 2 must have featured Newfoundland. Then on day 1, one of the remaining two breeds (Manx or Siamese) must be featured. But, neither Himalayans nor Rottweilers could be featured on day 5 and day 6, due to the conditions. This option is impossible. 
  D: If Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5, that means day 4 must have featured Greyhounds and day 6 must have featured Newfoundland. On day 7 the only remaining breed is Siamese. So, on day 2, one of the remaining two breeds (Himalayans or Rottweilers) must be featured. But, Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2 due to the condition, so this option is impossible.
  E: If Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6, that means day 5 must have featured Rottweilers and day 7 must have featured Himalayans. This leaves Siamese for day 2 and Greyhounds for day 1. On day 3 and day 4 one of the remaining breed (Himalayans or Rottweilers) could be featured. So, this option is possible.
  
Therefore, the answer is: 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1
  - Each pet breed is featured only once on each of the seven days.
  - No breed is featured on any two consecutive days
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
A: Siamese cannot be featured on day 2 because no breed can repeat consecutively. Therefore, this option is not possible.
B: Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7, so this option is not possible.
C: Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, so they can only be featured on days 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, this option is not possible because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
D: Rottweilers can only be featured on days 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, this option is possible. 
E: Manx cannot be featured on day 6 because no breed can repeat consecutively. Therefore, this option is not possible.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Analysis:
- Choice A is not possible as Greyhounds can only be featured on Day 1.
- Choice B is not possible as any breed on Day 1 cannot be featured on Day 7.
- Choice C is possible since Himalayans can be featured on Day 2 and Day 4, and Rottweilers can be featured on Day 3 and Day 5.
- Choice D is not possible as Rottweilers cannot be featured on Day 5 if it's already featured on Day 7.
- Choice E is not possible as Newfoundlands can only be featured on Day 2 or Day 4, and Manx can only be featured on Day 3 or Day 5.

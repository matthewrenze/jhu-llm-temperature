### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:

Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
Response 0:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. 
  A: This choice suggests that the advertisement may not be accurate because it overlooks the possibility that some of the new policyholders may have saved little or no money when they switched to Popelka.
  B: This choice is not relevant to the argument in the advertisement.
  C: This choice suggests that the advertisement may not be accurate because it fails to address the possibility that switching to another insurance company could enable many policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: This choice is not relevant to the argument in the advertisement.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  A: This choice suggests that the advertisement overlooks the possibility that some of the new policyholders surveyed saved little or no money when they switched to Popelka. However, the advertisement only claims that the sample representative reported savings of $250 a year, on average. It does not claim that all new policyholders saved that amount.
  B: This choice suggests that the advertisement takes for granted that new policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time. However, the advertisement does not make any claims about the difference in premiums between new and long-term policyholders.
  C: This choice suggests that the advertisement fails to address the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. However, the advertisement does not make any claims about the savings potential of other insurance companies.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

Group A performed better than Group B. The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  A: This fact is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that the groups are comparable in size.
  B: This fact is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that the same researchers were involved in both groups, which eliminates the possibility of researcher bias.
  C: This fact is not directly relevant to the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  D: This fact is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups had the same resources available to them.
  E: This fact is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups had the same amount of time to prepare for the task.

Knowledge: 
  The study compared the ability of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), to remember to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A.
  A: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it indicates that the two groups were of equal size, which is important for ensuring that the results are not skewed by differences in sample size.
  B: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it indicates that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which helps to ensure that any differences in the results are not due to differences in the way the calls were answered.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment where 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the first group may have been due to a placebo effect, rather than the magnets themselves.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  E: This statement suggests that the improvement in the first group may have been due to differences in the specific causes of the patients' back pain, rather than the magnets themselves.

Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment where 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the first group could be due to a placebo effect, which is not related to the magnets themselves.
  B: This statement is an opinion and does not provide any evidence to counter the physician's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the experiment conducted on the 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  D: This statement suggests that the scientists who designed the experiment may have had a bias towards magnetic fields, but it does not provide any evidence to counter the physician's argument.
  E: This statement suggests that the improvement in the first group could be due to the variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients, rather than the magnets themselves.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X to determine the number of people employed in that country simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed may not be accurate.

C: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
D: The government's new program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. If some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions, then the government's estimate of the total number of people employed in X would be overestimated. Therefore, this conclusion can be properly drawn from the information given.
E: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.

C: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
D: The government's new program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. If some employers issued separate paychecks for different types of pay, then the program would have counted each of those paychecks as a separate employee. Therefore, the government may have overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. 
E: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.

Action: Answer("D")

Analysis:
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X to determine the number of people employed in that country simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the number of paychecks issued in that quarter would not accurately reflect the number of people employed in X. 
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country in 1988.
  The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Since some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions, the number of paychecks issued per pay period would be higher than the actual number of people employed. Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. So, the correct answer is D.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products

The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
A: This is the correct answer. The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is due to a decline in total sales of the product. However, it is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased over the past five years, but other companies have gained market share at the expense of Wilson Appliance. Therefore, the conclusion that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago is not necessarily true.
  B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them in order to be valid.
  C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers in order to be valid.
  D: The argument assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Therefore, the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years is not relevant to the argument.

  B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them in order to be valid.
  C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers in order to be valid.
  D: The argument assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Therefore, the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years is not relevant to the argument.
  E: The argument does not need to provide independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products in order to be valid. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago, but currently, it only accounts for 25% of such sales. The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Finally, the argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: This is the correct answer. The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is due to a decline in the total sales of the product, which may not be true. It is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased over the past five years, but the sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer have decreased, resulting in a decline in market share.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them to support its conclusion.
C: The argument is only concerned with the sales figures of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers, so it is not necessary to discuss sales figures for the company's other products.
D: The argument assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, so an increase in the retail price of the hair dryer would not affect the conclusion.
E: The argument does not need to provide independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products to support its conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago, but now it only accounts for 25% of such sales. The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
A: This is the correct answer. The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is due to a decline in the total sales of that product. However, it is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased over the past five years, and that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales have simply not kept pace with the overall market. Therefore, the conclusion that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago is not necessarily valid.
  B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them in order to be valid.
  C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers in order to be valid.
  D: The argument assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Therefore, the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years is not relevant to the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

B: This choice describes a possible flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate description of the flaw. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
C: This choice does not describe a flaw in the argument. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
D: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the argument. The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
E: This choice describes a possible flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate description of the flaw. The argument does not fail to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.

This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument presents a situation where a healthier diet based on fish protein would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible to adopt the diet universally. Therefore, the argument concludes that the recommendation of such a diet should not be made.

Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about the city with the worst air pollution today. Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about all cities. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about where most of the public outcries against pollution came from. Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about the most polluted cities today.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not a good way to increase productivity because other things in the office can be distracting too.
A: This argument is about moderation and how it fails to take into account people's biological differences.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably or not does not affect the argument's conclusion.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument is only concerned with the relationship between fiber and colon cancer, not other types of cancer.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument assumes that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer, but it does not address whether it is difficult for people to include fiber in their diets.
D: This statement is relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument assumes that all types of fiber have the same effect on preventing colon cancer, but this may not be the case. If the fiber in fruits and vegetables has cancer-fighting properties to a greater degree than the fiber in cereals, then the argument's conclusion may not be valid.
E: This statement is also relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument assumes that fiber is the only substance in foods that prevents colon cancer, but this may not be the case. If other substances in foods containing fiber also prevent colon cancer, then the argument's conclusion may not be valid.

  D: This statement is relevant to the argument's reasoning. If the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees, then the argument's conclusion that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer may be too simplistic. However, the argument does not overlook this possibility, as it does not make any claims about the relative cancer-fighting properties of different types of fiber.
  E: This statement is also relevant to the argument's reasoning. If foods containing fiber also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer, then the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it may be too simplistic. However, the argument overlooks this possibility, as it assumes that the only factor that affects the incidence of colon cancer is the consumption of fiber.

Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

Action: Answer("D")
The argument overlooks the possibility that the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees. This means that the argument assumes that all types of fiber are equally effective in preventing colon cancer, which may not be the case. Therefore, choice D is the best answer.

A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not does not affect the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument is specifically about the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer, not the relationship between fiber consumption and other types of cancer.

This means that it is possible that the observed correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer is not due to fiber itself, but to other substances that are present in fiber-rich foods.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that the colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables. In Scandinavia, it has been shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
C: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
D: This statement is relevant to the argument's reasoning, as it suggests that the cancer-fighting properties of fiber may vary depending on the source of the fiber. However, the argument does not rely on the assumption that all sources of fiber have the same cancer-fighting properties, so this statement does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
E: This statement is relevant to the argument's reasoning, as it suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods may also contribute to the prevention of colon cancer. If this is the case, then the argument's conclusion that fiber alone is responsible for preventing colon cancer may be too simplistic.

It also claims that the colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not does not affect the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fiber diets or not does not affect the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
C: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets or not does not affect the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
D: This statement is relevant to the argument's reasoning. If the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees, then the argument's conclusion that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer may not be valid. However, the argument does not address this possibility, so it is a potential criticism of the argument's reasoning.

D: This statement is relevant to the argument's reasoning. If the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees, then the argument's conclusion that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer may be weakened. However, the argument does not overlook this possibility, as it does not make any claims about the relative cancer-fighting properties of the fiber in different foods.

E: This statement is also relevant to the argument's reasoning. If foods containing fiber also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer, then the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it may be weakened.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
C: This statement provides a possible explanation for why the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity is similar to that of leatherbacks in the wild. If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the ones that survive are less likely to die from diseases, which could explain why their life expectancy is similar to that of leatherbacks in captivity.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
E: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.

A: This statement provides information about other aquatic reptiles, but it does not help to resolve the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
B: This statement provides information about the life expectancy of sea turtles in general, but it does not help to resolve the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
C: This statement provides information about the cause of death of leatherbacks in the wild, but it does not help to resolve the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
D: This statement provides information about the difficulty of establishing an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks, but it does not help to resolve the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
E: If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, then it is possible that captive leatherbacks are not actually living as long as they appear to be. This could help to explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that Harrold Foods dominates the soft-drink market because "Hero" already dominates the market in the opinion of 72% of all consumers. The argument assumes that the current market share of "Hero" will remain the same in the future.

  The argument is based on the premise that any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market.
  The survey results show that 72 percent of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The conclusion is that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
  
Analysis:
  The argument seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the definition of market dominance. The fact that 72 percent of consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market does not necessarily mean that it actually does. The argument assumes that the survey results are an accurate reflection of the market, but it provides no evidence to support this assumption. Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.

Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise
  C: criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself
  D: taking lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim
  E: presupposing what it sets out to establish

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have been content with a different configuration of fingers if we had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
  A: This statement does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are always content with things of equal usefulness.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective criteria.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans could have descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and still have five fingers.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.

Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

Therefore, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
B: Oblicek suggested to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business, but she had no idea that it was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. Therefore, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, which caused the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. However, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm, which started a fire. Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms implies that the person has an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This assumption is not necessarily true, as some people may be carriers of the microorganism without developing symptoms, and others may have developed immunity through vaccination or previous exposure.
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors' hand-washing practices are the only factor affecting the value of the procedure in preventing disease.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:
Knowledge:

A: This choice is not a criticism of the journalist's argument, but rather a criticism of the book's claims in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
B: This choice is a criticism of the journalist's argument because it suggests that the journalist takes for granted that the physician is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of the drug.
C: This choice is not a criticism of the journalist's argument, but rather a criticism of the author of the book.
D: This choice is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument, but it does not directly address the vulnerability of the journalist's reasoning.
E: This choice is not a criticism of the journalist's argument, but rather a general statement that does not address the vulnerability of the journalist's reasoning.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

  The passage states that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain, and that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  
A: This statement is about the metabolic rate of early humans, but it does not help to resolve the apparent conflict presented in the passage.
B: This statement provides information about the size of the earliest known human brains, but it does not help to resolve the apparent conflict presented in the passage.
C: This statement contradicts the information presented in the passage, which states that the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
D: This statement provides information about the techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites, but it does not help to resolve the apparent conflict presented in the passage.
E: This statement provides a possible explanation for why early humans did not evolve their brains in shore environments, as it suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  A: This choice is irrelevant to the study's findings because it does not explain why workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  B: This choice is a possible explanation for the study's findings because it suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: This choice is irrelevant to the study's findings because it does not explain why workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  A: This choice does not explain the study's findings. It suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work, but it does not explain why workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  B: This choice suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This could help explain the study's findings, as it suggests that the increased risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome among workers reporting the least control over their own work may be due to the emotional stress they experience.
  C: This choice suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This does not explain the study's findings, as it does not address the relationship between control over one's own work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This choice suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work. This does not explain the study's findings, as the study specifically focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  E: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

  A: This choice is irrelevant to the study's findings because it does not provide any information about the relationship between control over one's work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  B: This choice provides a possible explanation for the study's findings, but it is not the most helpful in explaining the findings because it does not provide a direct link between lack of control and carpal tunnel syndrome.
  C: This choice provides a possible explanation for the study's findings because it suggests that the position of the arms and hands while typing may contribute to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This choice is irrelevant to the study's findings because it does not provide any information about the relationship between control over one's work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome among office workers who rarely use keyboards.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear, based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
D: This statement is not necessary for the argument, as the argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access food.
E: This statement is necessary for the argument, as it rules out the possibility that Diplodocus could have accessed underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. Instead, it could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: The argument does not require this assumption.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's ability to see in front of itself.
C: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's brain or blood supply.
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves.

Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
D: This statement is not necessary for the argument because the argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation.
E: This statement is necessary for the argument because it eliminates the possibility that Diplodocus could have browsed for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Instead, it could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

A: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones, not on the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision.
C: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's brain or blood supply.
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is required by the argument. The argument states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not consider the possibility that Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Knowledge: The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. However, the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument is about the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones and how it affected its feeding habits, not about the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument is about the feeding habits of Diplodocus based on the structure of its neck bones, not about its vision.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument is about the feeding habits of Diplodocus based on the structure of its neck bones, not about its brain or blood supply.
D: This statement is not necessary for the argument. The argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access vegetation (underwater) without having to raise up on its hind legs.
E: This statement is necessary for the argument. If Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then the argument's conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater, would not necessarily follow.

If Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then the argument's conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater, would not necessarily follow. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  
A: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones, not on the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision, so this assumption is not required.
C: The argument does not discuss the blood supply to Diplodocus's brain, so this assumption is not required.
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation. It only states that the structure of its neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is required by the argument. The argument states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not consider the possibility that Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the movement of raising its very long neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. However, the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

A: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones and does not compare it to modern animals.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision.
C: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's brain or blood supply.
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is required by the argument. The argument states that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. If Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then the argument's conclusion would not necessarily follow.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation. Instead, it could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

A: The argument does not depend on whether the same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not depend on whether Diplodocus was able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
C: The argument does not depend on whether it would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
D: The argument does not depend on whether Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
E: The argument does not depend on whether Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. The argument also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level, allowing it to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: The argument does not require this assumption.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The speaker's social circle may not be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it relies on anecdotal evidence rather than a representative sample.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses a small sample of people that the speaker knows to make a generalization about the entire population. This is a classic example of a biased sample, which is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument is flawed. Choice A accurately describes this flaw. Choice B describes circular reasoning, which is not present in the argument. Choice C describes an ad hominem fallacy, which is also not present in the argument. Choice D describes a distinction that is not relevant to the argument. Choice E describes an appeal to popularity fallacy, which is also not present in the argument.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses a small sample of people that the speaker knows to make a generalization about the entire population. This is a classic example of the fallacy of hasty generalization. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The sample of people the speaker knows may not be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it relies on evidence that is not necessarily indicative of the general population.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The speaker's social circle may not be representative of the general population.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychologist: The obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously. However much society may have changed over the centuries, human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction. Thus, the important social function of positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can be served only if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the psychologist's argument by the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously?
Choices:
  A: It is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion.
  B: It is used to counter a consideration that might be taken to undermine the argument's conclusion.
  C: It is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
  D: It is used to identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned.

  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.

  The passage describes two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast.
  In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  Horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
  Both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.

Analysis:
  A: The passage does not state that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature. It only states that some horror stories about monstrous beasts symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  B: The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. However, it does not state that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: The passage does not state that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed. It only states that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  D: The passage states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, it does not state that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: The passage does not state that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature. It only states that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, based on the comparison of two groups of joggers who stretch and do not stretch before jogging, respectively.
  A: This statement provides additional information about the rate of jogging injuries but does not directly relate to the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries.
  B: This statement suggests that some joggers may have difficulty performing stretches, which could affect the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries.
  C: This statement suggests that most jogging injuries are not caused by factors that stretching can prevent, which weakens the argument that stretching is ineffective in preventing injuries.
  D: This statement suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries are more likely to stretch, which could affect the comparison between the two groups of joggers and the conclusion that stretching is ineffective in preventing injuries.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: This choice criticizes the generalization made from the study, suggesting that the results may not be true for each of the five smaller groups.
  B: This choice criticizes the assumption that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola, suggesting that the study does not provide evidence for this claim.
  C: This choice criticizes the study for not testing all possible colas, suggesting that there may be other colas that elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This choice criticizes the study for not considering other factors that may influence consumers' preferences, such as packaging or price.
  E: This choice is not relevant to the reasoning presented in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted in a study where blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola.
  A: This criticism is not applicable because the study divided the volunteers evenly into five groups, each group tasting a different cola.
  B: This criticism is not applicable because the advertisement does not make any assumptions about the cost of Sparkle Cola or the other colas.
  C: This criticism is valid because the study only tested Sparkle Cola and five competing colas, and there may be other colas that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This criticism is valid because the study does not consider factors other than taste that may influence a consumer's preference for Sparkle Cola or a competing cola.
  E: This criticism is not applicable because the study only focuses on colas and not other beverages.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five competing colas.
  A: This choice criticizes the generalization made from the study, suggesting that the results may not be true for each of the five smaller groups.
  B: This choice criticizes the assumption that the volunteers would actually buy Sparkle Cola over the other colas in real-life situations.
  C: This choice criticizes the possibility that there may be other colas that would elicit an even more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This choice criticizes the possibility that there may be other reasons why people prefer Sparkle Cola over other colas, such as packaging or price.
  E: This choice is not relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: The study divided the volunteers into five groups, each tasting a different cola. Therefore, the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.
  B: The advertisement does not assume that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive. Therefore, this is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.
  C: The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested. Therefore, the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola is a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.
  D: The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested. Therefore, the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.

  B: This argument follows the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.
  C: This argument does not follow the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.
  D: This argument follows the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.
  E: This argument does not follow the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is if squirrels eat from it, and that the only reason squirrels eat from a bird feeder is if it lacks a protective cover.
  A: This argument is not flawed in the same way as the argument above. It is a valid argument that checking tire pressure regularly will prevent premature tire wear.
  B: This argument is flawed in the same way as the argument above. It assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is if the tire pressure is too low, and that the only reason the tire pressure will be too low is if the car owner neglects to check it regularly.
  C: This argument is not flawed in the same way as the argument above. It is a valid argument that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check tire pressure regularly.
  D: This argument is flawed in the same way as the argument above. It assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is if the tire pressure is too low, and that the only reason the tire pressure will be too low is if the car owner neglects to check it regularly.
  E: This argument is not flawed in the same way as the argument above. It is a valid argument that tire wear can be caused by factors other than low tire pressure.

Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors has led to a substantial decrease in patient injuries resulting from staff errors at several regional hospitals. The argument concludes that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
A: This statement provides information about the hospitals' policy before the implementation of the plan, but it does not strengthen the argument that the plan was effective in reducing patient injuries.
B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be solely attributed to the implementation of the plan.
C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to capture all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was a result of the staff becoming more careful in carrying out their duties after they became aware that their errors were being monitored.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide information about the effectiveness of the plan in reducing patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")

The reason for this decrease is that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not provide any information about the effect of the plan on the incidence of patient injuries.
B: This statement weakens the argument, as it suggests that factors other than the implementation of the plan may have contributed to the decrease in patient injuries.
C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not provide any information about the effect of the plan on the incidence of patient injuries.
D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was a direct result of the implementation of the plan, rather than a coincidence.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not provide any information about the effect of the plan on the incidence of patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors has led to a substantial decrease in patient injuries resulting from staff errors at several regional hospitals. The argument further states that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. It talks about a policy that was already in place before the plan was implemented.
B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. It talks about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan.
C: This statement weakens the argument. If the plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not, then the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries may not be solely attributed to the implementation of the plan.
D: This statement strengthens the argument. If the decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, then it is likely that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. It talks about the consequences of staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients.

Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. The CEO assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it is based on an assumption that may not be true. Choice A accurately identifies this flaw.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the number of species endangered by the development of wetlands compared to other types of development. This is not relevant to the argument.
B: This assumption is necessary for the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission. If the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will not survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, then the construction of replacement wetland habitats would not protect wildlife.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is about wetland development in industrialized nations, not primarily agricultural nations. This assumption is not necessary for the argument.
D: This assumption supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not necessary for the argument. The argument is about future wetland development, not past development.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is about protecting wildlife in wetlands, not about the severity of the threat to the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands. This assumption is not necessary for the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter due to the lack of certainty about the identity of the polluter.
  A: This principle is directly related to the argument, as it states that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the certainty of guilt.
  B: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it discusses the ideal severity of penalties, rather than the relationship between penalty severity and certainty of guilt.
  C: This principle is indirectly related to the argument, as it discusses the relationship between penalty severity and harm caused, but it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  D: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, rather than the relationship between penalty severity and certainty of guilt.
  E: This principle is directly related to the argument, as it states that penalty severity should not be so great that it is impossible to be certain of guilt.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter due to lack of sufficient evidence.
  A: This principle supports the reasoning in the argument by stating that the more severe the penalty is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty.
  B: This principle is not relevant to the argument as it talks about the severity of penalties in general, not in relation to the evidence required to impose them.
  C: This principle is not relevant to the argument as it talks about the proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused, not the evidence required to impose it.
  D: This principle is not relevant to the argument as it talks about the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, not the evidence required to impose a penalty.
  E: This principle directly supports the reasoning in the argument by stating that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter due to the lack of strong evidence.
  A: This principle is directly related to the argument, stating that a severe penalty requires a higher level of certainty of guilt.
  B: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it discusses the appropriate level of penalties, rather than the difficulty of imposing them.
  C: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it discusses the proportionality of penalties to harm, rather than the difficulty of imposing them.
  D: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, rather than the difficulty of imposing a penalty.
  E: This principle is directly related to the argument, stating that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it is impossible to justify punishment due to lack of certainty of guilt.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty on a polluter without sufficient evidence or admission of guilt.
  A: This principle supports the argument's reasoning that a severe penalty requires a higher level of certainty of guilt before it can be imposed.
  B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning about the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence or admission of guilt.
  C: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning about the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence or admission of guilt.
  D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning about the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence or admission of guilt.
  E: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning that a penalty cannot be so severe that it is impossible to be sufficiently certain of guilt before imposing punishment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the justification of imposing a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.
  The argument suggests that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to be certain of the identity of the polluter.
A: This principle is consistent with the reasoning in the argument. The argument suggests that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe and that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to be certain of the identity of the polluter. Therefore, the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
B: This principle is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument.
C: This principle is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument.
D: This principle is not consistent with the reasoning in the argument. The argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to be certain of the identity of the polluter, but it does not suggest that the penalty is so severe that someone will not come forward and admit responsibility.
E: This principle is similar to the reasoning in the argument, but it is not as strong as choice A. The argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to be certain of the identity of the polluter, but it also suggests that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe. Therefore, the severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense, but it should also be considered that the penalty is severe.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river due to lack of strong evidence or admission of responsibility.
  A: This principle supports the argument's reasoning by stating that a penalty should only be imposed if there is sufficient certainty of guilt.
  B: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning about the difficulty of imposing a penalty due to lack of evidence or admission of responsibility.
  C: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning about the difficulty of imposing a penalty due to lack of evidence or admission of responsibility.
  D: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning about the difficulty of imposing a penalty due to lack of evidence or admission of responsibility.
  E: This principle supports the argument's reasoning by stating that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be justified by the certainty of guilt.

Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the justification of imposing a penalty for pollution caused by an auto repair shop.
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also states that the evidence is not strong enough to justify imposing the penalty.
A: This principle supports the argument's reasoning by stating that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty. This principle justifies the argument's conclusion that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is needed before imposing the penalty.
B: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty and the need for stronger evidence.
C: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty and the need for stronger evidence.
D: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty and the need for stronger evidence.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  A: This choice suggests that the advertisement overlooks the possibility that some new policyholders did not save money by switching to Popelka. However, the advertisement does not claim that all new policyholders saved money, only that the average savings for those who did save money was $250 a year.
  B: This choice suggests that the advertisement takes for granted that new policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time. However, the advertisement does not make any assumptions about the premiums paid by new policyholders versus long-term policyholders.

However, the advertisement does not claim that Popelka is the only insurance company that could save policyholders money.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  A: This choice suggests that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed may have saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. However, the argument in the advertisement is based on the average savings reported by the sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed, so this choice is not the most vulnerable to criticism.
  B: This choice suggests that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time. However, the argument in the advertisement is not based on a comparison between new and old Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders, so this choice is not the most vulnerable to criticism.
  C: This choice suggests that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. However, the argument in the advertisement is not based on a comparison between Popelka and other insurance companies, so this choice is not the most vulnerable to criticism.
  D: This choice suggests that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. However, the argument in the advertisement is not based on an assumption about the accuracy of the reported savings, so this choice is not the most vulnerable to criticism.
  E: This choice suggests that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. This is a valid criticism of the argument in the advertisement because the sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed may not be representative of all auto insurance policyholders who could save money by switching to Popelka.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  A: This answer choice is not relevant to the conclusion of the argument.
  B: This answer choice supports the conclusion of the argument by stating that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: This answer choice restates the premise of the argument, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  D: This answer choice is not relevant to the conclusion of the argument.
  E: This answer choice contradicts the premise of the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The ethicist also rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist.
  B: This answer choice supports the argument made by the ethicist. It states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: This answer choice restates the argument made by the ethicist, but it does not enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
  D: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist.
  E: This answer choice contradicts the argument made by the ethicist. The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  A: This statement is not directly related to the conclusion of the argument.
  B: This statement supports the conclusion of the argument by stating that the responsibility of a person for an action is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: This statement is a restatement of the premise of the argument, not an assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  D: This statement is not directly related to the conclusion of the argument.
  E: This statement contradicts the premise of the argument and is not an assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The question asks which assumption enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
  
Action: Answer(B) 
Explanation: 
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim. In order to do so, the ethicist must assume that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This assumption enables the ethicist to argue that we can still praise or blame a person for an action even if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action. Choice A is incorrect because it goes beyond the scope of the argument. Choice C is incorrect because it simply restates the premise of the argument. Choice D is incorrect because it introduces a new idea that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree. Choice E is incorrect because it is the opposite of what the ethicist is arguing.
Response 4:
Knowledge: The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The ethicist also rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment with 50 patients with chronic back pain. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the patients in the first group may have reported a reduction in pain simply because they knew they were receiving treatment, not because the magnets actually had any effect.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields at relieving back pain.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields at relieving back pain.
  D: This statement suggests that the experiment may have been biased in favor of magnetic fields, but it does not directly counter the argument that magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain.
  E: This statement suggests that the reduction in pain reported by the patients in the first group may have been due to factors other than the magnets, such as differences in the causes of their back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment where 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the first group may have been due to a placebo effect rather than the magnets themselves.
  B: This statement is an opinion and does not provide evidence that contradicts the physician's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument about whether magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain.
  D: This statement suggests that the experiment may have been biased in favor of the magnets, but it does not provide evidence that contradicts the physician's argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result?
Choices:
  A: For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
  B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that we should not conclude that the president's speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony, and that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  
A: The argument does not take for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory. Rather, it argues that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

B: The argument does not fail to address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences. Rather, it argues that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

C: The argument does not favor the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing. Rather, it argues that we should not conclude that the president's speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony, and that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

D: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the argument. The argument concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true. However, this is not a sufficient reason to reject Riley's claim. Therefore, this is the correct answer.

E: The argument does not fail to address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded. Rather, it argues that we should not conclude that the president's speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony, and that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:

  The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The new computer program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. So, the correct answer is D.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The new program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed may not be accurate. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:

A: The passage does not provide any information to support this conclusion. 
B: The passage does not provide any information to support this conclusion. 
C: The passage does not provide any information to support this conclusion. 
D: The government's new computer program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. If some employers issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions, then the government's estimate of the total number of people employed in X would be overestimated. Therefore, it can be properly concluded that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. 
E: The passage does not provide any information to support this conclusion.

  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
Action: Answer("D")  
The fact that some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions means that the number of paychecks issued per pay period would be greater than the number of people employed. Therefore, the government's estimate of the total number of people employed in X would be overestimated. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products

A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It specifically states that the market share has declined.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them, as it is only concerned with Wilson Appliance's net income.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers, as it is only concerned with the hair dryer product.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which could have offset the decline in market share and kept the net income stable.
E: The argument does not provide any evidence about whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.

B: This choice is not relevant to the argument, which is concerned with the decline in net income from sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer.
C: This choice is not relevant to the argument, which is concerned with the decline in net income from sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer.

  B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them in order to be valid.
  C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers in order to be valid.
  D: The argument assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Therefore, the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years is not relevant to the argument.
  E: The argument does not need to provide independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products in order to be valid. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% of all hair dryer sales nationwide over the past 5 years.
  The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The conclusion is that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. The argument is specifically about the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. The argument is about Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of their hair dryer.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers. The argument is specifically about the hair dryer product.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years. This could affect the net income from sales of the product, and is a flaw in the argument.
E: The argument does not provide evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. This is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers five years ago, but now it accounts for only 25% of such sales. The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. The conclusion is that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It clearly states that the hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers five years ago, but now it accounts for only 25% of such sales.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. The argument is about Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer and its net income from sales of the product.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers. The argument is about Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer and its net income from sales of the product.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years. If the retail price of the hair dryer has increased, then the company's net income from sales of the product may not be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
E: The argument does not provide any evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  A: This statement does not directly relate to the argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  B: If the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, it would suggest that they did not raft over from the Americas, which would weaken the scientist's argument.
  C: This statement does not directly relate to the argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, despite the purchase of the latest safety technology. The editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago to support this claim.
  
A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has been inferred from a limited number of particular instances (studies conducted 30 years ago). However, this flaw is not the most accurate description of the argument's flaw.
B: This choice describes a possible flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does not consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is. However, this flaw is not the most accurate description of the argument's flaw.
C: This choice does not describe a flaw in the argument. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago. The argument simply disagrees with the council members' conclusion that the increase would not decrease safety.
D: This choice most accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim. The editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago, but does not provide any evidence that the latest safety technology would not make a difference in the safety of the airport.
E: This choice describes a possible flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does not consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind. However, this flaw is not the most accurate description of the argument's flaw.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, despite the purchase of the latest safety technology. The editorialist supports this argument by citing numerous studies conducted 30 years ago that show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
A: This choice describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in turn been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances. The editorialist cites numerous studies conducted 30 years ago, but it is not clear how many airports were studied or how representative those airports were of all airports. 
B: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is. The editorialist specifically mentions that several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
C: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago. The argument is not about the knowledge or awareness of the council members, but rather about the safety implications of increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity.
D: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument does not confuse an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim. The editorialist cites evidence from studies conducted 30 years ago that suggest that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity reduces safety, even with the latest safety technology.
E: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument does not fail to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind. The argument is focused on the safety implications of increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity, not on the potential benefits of doing so.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, citing studies conducted 30 years ago.
  Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  
A: This choice describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does draw a conclusion based on a limited number of instances, but this is not the main flaw.
B: This choice suggests a possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not the most accurate flaw in the argument.
C: This choice suggests that the council members may be aware of the studies, but it does not address the flaw in the editorialist's argument.
D: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument assumes that the absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity is evidence against this claim.
E: This choice suggests that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable, but it does not address the flaw in the editorialist's argument.

A: This choice describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
B: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. It is not relevant to the argument whether the latest technology can allow more air traffic than the airport was originally designed for without reducing safety.
C: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. Even if the council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago, it does not mean that the studies are no longer relevant or that the increase would not decrease safety.
D: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist cites evidence that shows that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
E: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument is about safety and does not consider other benefits that might be gained from the increase in air traffic.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, citing studies conducted 30 years ago.
  Several council members believe that the increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  
A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does draw a conclusion based on a limited number of instances (studies conducted 30 years ago), but this is not the main flaw in the argument.

C: This choice suggests a possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not the most accurate flaw in the argument.
D: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the argument. The editorialist confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
E: This choice suggests a possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not the most accurate flaw in the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, citing studies conducted 30 years ago that show this to be the case.
  A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate one. The argument does not draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: This choice suggests a possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not the most accurate flaw in the argument. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the latest technology might make it safe to allow more air traffic than the airport was originally designed for.
  C: This choice suggests a possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not the most accurate flaw in the argument. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: This choice suggests a possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not the most accurate flaw in the argument. The argument does not fail to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, citing studies conducted 30 years ago that show this to be the case even with the latest safety technology.

  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, citing studies conducted 30 years ago.
  Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  
A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has been inferred from a limited number of particular instances (studies conducted 30 years ago), but this is not the most accurate description of the flaw.
B: This choice suggests a possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not the most accurate description of the flaw. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the latest technology might allow for an increase in air traffic without reducing safety; rather, the argument specifically mentions that the council members believe this to be the case.
C: This choice is not a flaw in the argument, but rather a possibility that the argument fails to consider. The argument does not address whether the council members are aware of the studies conducted 30 years ago.
D: This choice most accurately describes the flaw in the argument. The argument assumes that the absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity is evidence against this claim. However, the existence of evidence against the claim (the studies conducted 30 years ago) does not necessarily mean that the claim is false.
E: This choice is not a flaw in the argument, but rather a possibility that the argument fails to consider. The argument does not address whether a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument presents a situation where a healthier diet based on fish protein would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible to adopt the diet universally.
A: The argument presents evidence that taking vitamin E supplements reduces the risk of heart attack, but it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. Therefore, the argument recommends against recommending everyone to take vitamin E supplements every day.
B: The argument presents a situation where heavy taxes on tobacco generate revenue for education, but if the taxes become too high, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding generated for education. Therefore, the argument suggests that such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
C: The argument presents a situation where limiting purchases to what one truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income is better for the consumer, but if everyone did this, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Over the last few decades, public outcries against pollution have brought about stricter regulations of emissions. The cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. This would not have happened without these stricter regulations.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the statements above?
Choices:
  A: In the city with the worst air pollution today, the air quality is better than it was 30 years ago.
  B: No city has worse air pollution today than it did 30 years ago.
  C: Most of the public outcries against pollution came from people in the cities that had the most polluted air.
  D: The most polluted cities today are not the cities that were the most polluted 30 years ago.
  E: Public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not blocked. 
  A: The argument is about how different people react differently to substances, so moderation is not a useful concept.
  B: The argument is about how banning an electronic device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals is not reasonable because most chemicals cause cancer in high doses.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.

Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens immune response because it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers, while M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal even though only about 10 percent of the people who harbor it get sick from it.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning that M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because people who harbor it derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that the number of people who harbor a bacterium is a relevant factor in determining whether it is a commensal or not, which is not necessarily the case.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response. The comparison is made to M tuberculosis, which also causes disease in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  A: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning, as it suggests that M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because people who harbor it derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning, as it suggests that the prevalence of H pylori is much higher than that of M tuberculosis, which could explain why H pylori is considered a commensal despite causing disease in some people.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite its alleged benefits because it can cause stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal despite the fact that only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick from it.
  A: This statement does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement weakens the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the presence of M tuberculosis does not provide any benefit to the host, which is a key characteristic of a commensal.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not does not affect the argument's conclusion.
B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether high-fiber diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer or not does not affect the argument's conclusion.
C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets or not does not affect the argument's conclusion.
D: This statement is relevant to the argument's reasoning. If the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees, then the argument's conclusion that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer may not be valid.
E: This statement is relevant to the argument's reasoning. If foods containing fiber also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer, then the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer may not be valid.

The argument overlooks the possibility that the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees. This is a potential weakness in the argument because it assumes that all types of fiber have the same effect on colon cancer. If the fiber in fruits and vegetables is more effective at preventing colon cancer than the fiber in cereals, for example, then the argument's conclusion may be less convincing.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that the colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not does not affect the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

B: This choice is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether high-fiber diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer or not does not affect the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

C: This choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets or not does not affect the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

D: This choice is relevant to the argument's reasoning. If the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees, then the argument's conclusion that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer may be too simplistic. The argument assumes that all types of fiber have the same effect on colon cancer, but this may not be the case.

E: This choice is also relevant to the argument's reasoning. If foods containing fiber also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer, then the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer may be too simplistic. The argument assumes that fiber is the only factor affecting colon cancer, but this may not be the case.

Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
  The argument provides evidence from studies that show that colon cancer rates are higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods, and lower in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  The argument also provides evidence from Scandinavia that shows that areas with lower consumption of cereals (which are high in fiber) have higher colon cancer rates.
  
A: This choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
C: This choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
E: This choice is the most likely answer, as it suggests that the argument overlooks the possibility that other substances in fiber-containing foods may be responsible for the observed correlation between high-fiber diets and lower colon cancer incidence. This would weaken the argument's claim that insufficient fiber consumption causes colon cancer and sufficient fiber consumption prevents it.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that the colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods. The argument further claims that in Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  
A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably or not. This information is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion.
B: The argument does not address whether high-fiber diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer or not. This information is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion.
C: The argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets or not. This information is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion.
D: The argument does not address whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees or not. This information is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion.
E: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument. The argument assumes that it is the fiber in foods that prevents colon cancer, but it overlooks the possibility that other substances in fiber-rich foods may also play a role in preventing colon cancer. Therefore, this choice is the best answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence. It also claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not does not affect the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument. The argument focuses on the relationship between fiber and colon cancer, not the relationship between fiber and other types of cancer.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument does not address whether it is difficult for people to include fiber in their diets.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument does not compare the cancer-fighting properties of different types of fiber.
  E: This statement is relevant to the argument. The argument claims that fiber prevents colon cancer, but it overlooks the possibility that other substances in foods containing fiber may also prevent colon cancer. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that the colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables. In Scandinavia, it has been shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  
A: The argument is not concerned with the trend of fiber consumption in many countries, but with the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.
B: The argument only focuses on the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates, not on the risk of other types of cancer.
C: The argument does not address the difficulty of including fiber in one's diet, but rather the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.
D: The argument does not compare the cancer-fighting properties of different types of fiber, but rather focuses on the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.
E: This is a possible criticism of the argument, as it is possible that other substances in fiber-rich foods may be responsible for the observed correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia, it has been shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fiber. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably or not. This choice is irrelevant to the argument.
B: The argument does not address the risk of many types of cancer being reduced by high-fiber diets. This choice is irrelevant to the argument.
C: The argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets. This choice is irrelevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not address whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees. This choice is irrelevant to the argument.
E: This choice presents a possibility that the argument overlooks. The argument only focuses on the relationship between fiber and colon cancer and does not address whether foods containing fiber also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence. It further claims that the colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods, and that in Scandinavia, areas with lower consumption of cereals (which are high in fiber) have higher colon cancer rates. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning, as the argument is not concerned with changes in fiber consumption over time.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning, as the argument is only concerned with the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning, as the argument does not address the difficulty of including fiber in one's diet.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning, as the argument does not compare the cancer-fighting properties of different types of fiber.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
C: This statement does not explain why leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
D: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
E: This statement could help resolve the discrepancy if it is true that the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, and that leatherbacks in captivity are not actually older than those in the wild.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales in the market.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and will continue to do so if it maintains its current market share.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that "Hero" already dominates the market in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers.
  The argument assumes that the definition of market dominance is based solely on sales percentage.
  The argument does not provide any evidence to support the claim that Harrold Foods will maintain its current market share.
  
Analysis:
  A: The argument does not commit this error.
  B: The argument does not commit this error.
  C: The argument does not commit this error.
  D: The argument does not commit this error.
  E: The argument commits this error by assuming that the survey results obtained in the past will continue to obtain in the future.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" already has more than 50% of the sales in the market. 
  The argument does not provide any evidence that the market share of "Hero" will remain constant in the future.

  This is a fallacy known as the fallacy of assuming that what is true now will be true in the future.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales in the market.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about Harrold Foods attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. 
  The survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. 
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument is based on the premise that any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market.
  The survey results show that 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The conclusion is that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
  
Analysis:
  The argument seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the definition of market dominance. The fact that 72% of consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market does not necessarily mean that it actually does. The argument assumes that the perception of dominance is equivalent to actual dominance, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.

The argument is based on the premise that any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market. However, the argument fails to consider that the market conditions may change in the future, and that Harrold Foods may need to continue to invest in advertising to maintain its market share.

B: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.

The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.

  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  The rate of sales meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations.
  
A: This information is not relevant to the prediction made by the publisher.
B: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then the rental period of two days is not enough for most players to complete the game. This means that players will have to rent the game multiple times to complete it, which will increase the rental revenue for the publisher. This supports the prediction made by the publisher that rentals will exceed expectations.
C: This information is not relevant to the prediction made by the publisher.
D: If most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, then they are less likely to recommend the game to others, which could negatively impact the sales of the game. This information does not support the prediction made by the publisher.

A: The statement does not address whether foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve. This choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: This choice is not supported by the argument. The official only argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
C: This choice is not supported by the argument. The official does not mention that only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
D: This choice contradicts the argument made by the official. The official argues that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Therefore, foreign citizens should not be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries.
E: This choice contradicts the argument made by the official. The official argues that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. Therefore, cabinet undersecretaries should be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise
  C: criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself
  D: taking lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim
  E: presupposing what it sets out to establish

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the configuration of fingers in humans is not necessarily the best or most useful, and that humans would be just as content with a different configuration if we had evolved from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.

Context: One should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film.

  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  - Statement A is not necessarily true because the museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  - Statement C is not necessarily true because the museum store may not have prints of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  - Statement D is not necessarily true because Hopper's Nighthawks is not necessarily on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  - Statement E is not necessarily true because the painting may be displayed in the museum.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that if someone is not affected by a microorganism, then they must have immunity to it. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it is possible for someone to not develop harmful symptoms due to other factors, such as a low dose of the microorganism or a strong immune system. 
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors washing their hands less often than other health care professionals means that hand washing is not effective in preventing disease, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms implies that the person has an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because there could be other reasons why a person does not develop harmful symptoms after exposure to staphylococcus.
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.

Response 6:
Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms implies having an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This assumption is not necessarily true, as some people may be carriers of staphylococcus without showing symptoms but still be able to transmit the infection to others. Therefore, the student's argument is flawed.
A: This argument is flawed because it confuses moral rightness with serving the interests of everyone.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  A: This choice does not explain the study's findings. It is about the amount of typing done by office workers who have the most control over their own work and those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: This choice provides a possible explanation for the study's findings. It suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: This choice does not explain the study's findings. It is about the keyboards on which office workers type.
  D: This choice does not explain the study's findings. It is about office workers who rarely use keyboards.
  E: This choice does not explain the study's findings. It is about the repetitive motions performed by office workers who have the most control over their own work and those who have the least control over their own work.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

  A: This choice is not relevant to the study's findings.
  B: This choice suggests a possible explanation for the study's findings, but it does not directly explain the relationship between control over one's own work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  C: This choice suggests a possible cause of carpal tunnel syndrome, but it does not directly explain the relationship between control over one's own work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This choice is not relevant to the study's findings.
  E: This choice suggests a possible alternative explanation for the study's findings, but it does not directly explain the relationship between control over one's own work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  The study focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
A: This statement does not explain the study's findings. It suggests that workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do less typing, but it does not explain why those who have the least control over their own work have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
B: This statement suggests a possible explanation for the study's findings. It suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
C: This statement does not explain the study's findings. It suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, but it does not explain why workers who have the least control over their own work have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
D: This statement is not relevant to the study's findings. It discusses office workers who rarely use keyboards, whereas the study focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
E: This statement does not explain the study's findings. It suggests that workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often, but it does not explain why those who have the least control over their own work have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  A: This choice does not explain the study's findings. It is about the amount of typing, not the level of control over one's work.
  B: This choice is about the emotional stress caused by a lack of control over one's work, but it does not explain the study's findings.
  C: This choice is about the keyboards used by office workers, but it does not explain the study's findings.
  D: This choice is about office workers who rarely use keyboards, but it does not explain the study's findings.
  E: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This could explain the study's findings because it suggests that the workers with the most control over their own work are less likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome because they are not doing as much typing as those with less control.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.

  B: This choice provides a possible explanation for the study's findings, but it does not directly help to explain the findings.
  C: This choice provides a possible explanation for the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, but it does not directly help to explain the study's findings.
  D: This choice is not relevant to the study's findings because it only considers office workers who rarely use keyboards.
  E: This choice provides a possible explanation for the study's findings, as it suggests that office workers with the most control over their own work are less likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome because they perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.

  A: This choice does not help to explain the study's findings because it talks about the amount of typing done by workers with different levels of control over their work, but it does not address the relationship between control over work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  B: This choice suggests a possible explanation for the study's findings, as it suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work can lead to emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: This choice does not help to explain the study's findings because it talks about the keyboards on which office workers type, but it does not address the relationship between control over work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This choice does not help to explain the study's findings because it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards, but the study is focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  E: This choice does not help to explain the study's findings because it talks about repetitive motions other than typing, but the study is focused on the relationship between typing and carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but it could bend downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This statement is not required by the argument, as the argument does not claim that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  E: This statement is required by the argument, as the argument claims that Diplodocus fed on underwater vegetation from dry land, and this statement rules out the possibility that Diplodocus could have browsed for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

A: The argument does not require this assumption.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision.
C: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's brain or blood supply.
D: The argument does not require this assumption.
E: This assumption is required by the argument because the argument states that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater, and does not mention any other way of accessing underwater vegetation.

The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones, not on the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision or head angle.
C: The argument does not mention anything about the blood supply to Diplodocus's brain.
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is required by the argument. The argument states that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

A: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones, not on the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision, so this assumption is not required.
C: The argument does not mention anything about the blood supply to Diplodocus's brain, so this assumption is not required.
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation. It only states that the structure of its neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is required by the argument. The argument states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not consider the possibility that Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the movement of raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

Analysis:
The question asks for an assumption required by the argument. An assumption is an unstated premise that must be true for the argument to be valid.

A: The argument does not require the assumption that the same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not require the assumption that Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
C: The argument does not require the assumption that it would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
D: The argument does not require the assumption that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
E: The argument requires the assumption that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, as the argument states that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

Analysis:
The question asks for an assumption required by the argument. An assumption is an unstated premise that is necessary for the argument to hold.

A: This statement is not necessary for the argument. The argument is about the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones, not about the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: This statement is not necessary for the argument. The argument is about Diplodocus's feeding habits, not its vision.
C: This statement is not necessary for the argument. The argument is about Diplodocus's feeding habits, not its brain.
D: This statement is not necessary for the argument. The argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation (i.e. by bending downward and extending its neck below ground level).
E: This statement is necessary for the argument. If Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then the argument's conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater, would not necessarily follow.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the feeding habits of Diplodocus and how its neck structure would have prevented it from browsing for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This statement is not required by the argument because the argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation.
  E: This statement is required by the argument because it eliminates other possible ways for Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is based on the personal experience of the speaker and their social circle, which is not a representative sample of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. This is a classic example of the fallacy of hasty generalization.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses a sample of people known to the speaker, which is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw. Choice B describes circular reasoning, which is not present in the argument. Choice C describes an ad hominem fallacy, which is also not present in the argument. Choice D describes a distinction that is not relevant to the argument. Choice E describes an argument from popularity, which is also not present in the argument.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is based on the premise that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal, and therefore the official results must be rigged. However, this is a flawed reasoning because the sample of people the speaker knows may not be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw in the reasoning.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses a small sample of people that the speaker knows to make a conclusion about the entire population. This is a hasty generalization and is not a reliable way to draw conclusions about a larger population. Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning is that the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw. The other choices do not accurately describe the flaw in the reasoning.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the person knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The sample of people the person knows may not be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it relies on evidence that is not necessarily indicative of the truth. Choice A accurately describes this flaw.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is based on the personal experience of the person making the argument, which is a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the person knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses a small sample of people known to the arguer to make a claim about the general population. This is a classic example of a hasty generalization fallacy. The fact that everyone the arguer knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses a sample of people known to the arguer, which is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the arguer knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The argument is flawed because it relies on a sample that is not representative of the population as a whole. Therefore, the most accurate description of the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses a biased sample (the people the author knows) to make a generalization about the entire population. This is a classic example of a hasty generalization fallacy. Therefore, the most accurate description of the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A is the best answer.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses anecdotal evidence, which is drawn from a small and unrepresentative sample of people the speaker knows, to dispute the official results of the national referendum. This is a logical fallacy known as hasty generalization. The speaker's personal experience is not a reliable indicator of how most people voted. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.

  The passage describes two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast.
  In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  Horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
  Both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.

Analysis:
  A: The passage only states that some horror stories about monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature, not all of them. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  B: The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader, but it does not say that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  C: The passage only states that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  D: The passage states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, but it does not say that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.

Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.

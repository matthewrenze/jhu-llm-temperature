### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument presents a conditional statement and concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds. The argument assumes that the only reason squirrels eat from a bird feeder is that it lacks a protective cover. This assumption is flawed because there could be other reasons why squirrels eat from a bird feeder.
A: The argument presents a conditional statement and concludes that checking tire pressure regularly will prevent tires from wearing out prematurely. The argument assumes that the only reason a tire wears out prematurely is that the tire pressure is too low. This assumption is flawed because there could be other reasons why a tire wears out prematurely.
B: The argument presents a conditional statement and concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. The argument assumes that the only reason tire pressure becomes too low is that the car owner neglects to check it regularly. This assumption is flawed because there could be other reasons why tire pressure becomes too low.
C: The argument presents a conditional statement and concludes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check tire pressure regularly. The argument assumes that car owners are unaware of the consequences of neglecting to check tire pressure regularly. This assumption is flawed because car owners could be aware of the consequences but still neglect to check tire pressure regularly.
D: The argument presents a conditional statement and concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. The argument assumes that the only reason tire pressure becomes too low is that the car owner neglects to check it regularly. This assumption is flawed because there could be other reasons why tire pressure becomes too low.
E: The argument presents a conditional statement and concludes that keeping tire pressure from becoming too low will not help a tire last longer if it is often driven on gravel roads. The argument assumes that the only reason a tire wears out prematurely is that the tire pressure is too low or it is often driven on gravel roads. This assumption is flawed because there could be other reasons why a tire wears out prematurely.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:

Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics

Knowledge: The biologist argues that the critics of the study are wrong to doubt its results, despite the small sample size, because the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years. The study concludes that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.

Action: Answer("E") 

The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The argument suggests that the study's author's reputation and past work are sufficient to support the study's conclusions, without providing any additional evidence or explanation. This is a fallacy known as an "appeal to authority." The argument fails to address the critics' specific concerns about the small sample size and the generalizability of the study's conclusions beyond chameleons.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that the study's conclusion is correct despite its small sample size because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  A: The biologist does not generalize the behavior of chameleons to all lizards, but rather suggests that the study's conclusion applies to chameleons specifically.
  B: The argument does not address how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun, but this is not a vulnerability of the argument.
  C: The argument does focus on the study's author, but this is not a vulnerability of the argument.
  D: The argument does not demonstrate that the study's critics lack relevant expertise, but this is not a vulnerability of the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors has led to a substantial decrease in patient injuries resulting from staff errors at several regional hospitals.
  
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument as it talks about a different policy that was already in place before the implementation of the new plan.

B: This statement weakens the argument as it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be solely attributed to the implementation of the new plan.

C: This statement does not affect the argument as it talks about errors that were not recorded under the plan.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did.
  A: The CEO does not address the possibility of future developments in production methods, but this is not central to their argument.
  B: The CEO's argument is not concerned with different causes having similar effects.
  C: The CEO's argument does generalize from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms.
  D: The CEO does not take for granted that the company has succeeded in reducing the amount of pollution produced, but rather argues that they are environmentally responsible because they are doing all they can to pollute less.
  E: The CEO's argument does not address the possibility of there being other production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The CEO argues that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did, and there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  A: The CEO does not address whether production methods that do not produce pollution can be developed or not.
  B: The CEO's argument does not involve different causes having similar effects.
  C: The CEO's argument does not generalize too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms.
  D: The CEO's argument does not take for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded.
  E: The CEO's argument acknowledges that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, and does not address whether there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. The CEO assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument is flawed in assuming that the current production methods pollute significantly less than the old methods and that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The CEO's argument is flawed because it assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. This is a flawed assumption because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. Therefore, choice A is the correct answer. Choices B, C, D, and E are not directly related to the flaw in the CEO's argument.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute less than their old methods did, and there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  A: This choice is relevant to the argument, but the CEO does not make this assumption.
  B: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This choice is relevant to the argument, but the CEO does not make this generalization.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

If the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will not survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, then the offsetting of future wetland development with the construction of replacement wetland habitats would not protect wildlife.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is concerned with wetland development in industrialized nations, not primarily agricultural ones. This assumption is not necessary for the argument to hold.
D: This assumption supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not necessary for the argument to hold.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is concerned with protecting wildlife in general, not just the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands. This assumption is not necessary for the argument to hold.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that Figoria has as much right to govern its own resources as other countries.
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the number of species endangered by the development of wetlands compared to other types of development.
B: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not address the regulation of wetland development in nations that are primarily agricultural.
D: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the severity of the threat to the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands compared to other designated endangered species.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife and that development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that they have as much right to govern their own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
  
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption. The argument is focused on the protection of wildlife in wetlands, not on the comparison of the effects of wetland development on wildlife versus other types of development.
B: This assumption is necessary for the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission to hold. If the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will not survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, then the construction of replacement wetlands would not offset the loss of natural wetlands.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is focused on the regulation of wetland development in industrialized nations, not on the regulation of wetland development in primarily agricultural nations. Therefore, this assumption is not necessary for the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission to hold.
D: This assumption supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not necessary for the argument to hold. The argument is focused on the protection of wildlife in wetlands, not on the past success of Figorian regulation of development.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption. The argument is focused on the protection of wildlife in wetlands, not on the severity of the threat to the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife and that this would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that they have as much right to govern their own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
  
  A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption. The argument is about the need to regulate wetland development to protect wildlife, not about the relative endangerment of species due to different types of development.
  B: This assumption is necessary for the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission to hold. If the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats would not survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, then the construction of replacement wetlands would not protect wildlife and the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission would be weakened.
  C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is about the need to regulate wetland development to protect wildlife, regardless of the type of nation in which it occurs. This assumption is not necessary for the argument to hold.
  D: This assumption supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not necessary for the argument to hold. The argument is about the need to regulate wetland development to protect wildlife, not about the past success of Figorian regulation.
  E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is about the need to regulate wetland development to protect wildlife, regardless of the severity of the threat to the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands. This assumption is not necessary for the argument to hold.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The argument is discussing the difficulty in justifying the imposition of a severe penalty for pollution without sufficient evidence of the polluter's identity. 
A: This principle is directly relevant to the argument and supports the reasoning that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is necessary before imposing the penalty.
B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument and does not address the question of whether the penalty is justified without sufficient evidence.
C: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument and does not address the question of whether the penalty is justified without sufficient evidence.
D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument and does not address the question of whether the penalty is justified without sufficient evidence.
E: This principle is directly relevant to the argument and supports the reasoning that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be justified without sufficient evidence.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the justification for imposing a penalty for pollution caused by a local auto repair shop.
  The argument suggests that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is required to be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
A: This principle states that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party. This principle supports the reasoning in the argument because it suggests that a severe penalty requires stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility to be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
B: This principle is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument.
C: This principle is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument.
D: This principle is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument.
E: This principle is similar to the principle in choice A, but it is not as strong. It suggests that the severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense. However, the argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is required to be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty, rather than suggesting that the penalty is too severe to be justified.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter without sufficient evidence.
  A: This principle is directly related to the argument, as it suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the certainty of guilt.
  B: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it discusses the appropriate level of penalties in general, rather than the relationship between penalty severity and certainty of guilt.
  C: This principle is related to the argument, but it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt and the difficulty of imposing a penalty without sufficient evidence.
  D: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense, rather than the difficulty of imposing a penalty without sufficient evidence.
  E: This principle is directly related to the argument, as it suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it is impossible to justify punishment due to insufficient evidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the justification of imposing a penalty for pollution.
  The argument suggests that the penalty is too severe to be imposed without stronger evidence or admission of responsibility.
  A: This principle is consistent with the argument's reasoning that the penalty is too severe to be imposed without sufficient certainty of the polluter's identity.
  B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty for pollution.
  C: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning about the certainty of the polluter's identity.
  D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning about the certainty of the polluter's identity.
  E: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning that the penalty is too severe to be imposed without sufficient certainty of the polluter's identity.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the justification for imposing a penalty for a pollution infraction.
  The argument suggests that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also suggests that the evidence is not strong enough to be certain of the identity of the polluter.
A: This principle is consistent with the argument's reasoning that stronger evidence is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty or the certainty of the polluter's identity.
C: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty or the certainty of the polluter's identity.
D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning about the certainty of the polluter's identity or the justification for imposing the penalty.

  B: This principle is not directly related to the argument and does not support the reasoning.
  C: This principle is related to the severity of the penalty, but it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  D: This principle is not directly related to the argument and does not support the reasoning.
  E: This principle is directly related to the argument and supports the reasoning that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the certainty of guilt.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about imposing a penalty on the polluter of a river.
  The argument concludes that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, the penalty cannot be imposed.
  The reason for this conclusion is that the penalty is severe.
A: This principle is consistent with the reasoning in the argument. The argument concludes that the penalty cannot be imposed because there is not enough certainty about the identity of the polluter, and this principle suggests that the more severe the penalty is, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing the penalty.
B: This principle is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument.
C: This principle is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument.
D: This principle is not consistent with the reasoning in the argument. The argument suggests that the severity of the penalty is a reason why the polluter might not admit responsibility, not that the severity of the penalty makes it less likely that anyone will admit responsibility.
E: This principle is consistent with the reasoning in the argument. The argument concludes that the penalty cannot be imposed because there is not enough certainty about the identity of the polluter, and this principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment.
Action: Answer("A")

  B: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it discusses the appropriate level of penalties in general, rather than in relation to the certainty of guilt.
  C: This principle is related to the argument, but it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt, which is the main concern of the argument.
  D: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, rather than the certainty of guilt.
  E: This principle is directly related to the argument, as it suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be justified by the certainty of guilt.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter due to lack of evidence.
  A: This principle is relevant to the argument because it suggests that the severity of the penalty requires a higher level of certainty of guilt. 
  B: This principle is not relevant to the argument because it discusses the appropriate level of penalties, not the level of certainty required to impose them.
  C: This principle is not relevant to the argument because it discusses the proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused, not the level of certainty required to impose it.
  D: This principle is not relevant to the argument because it discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, not the level of certainty required to impose a penalty.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The Florida panther population has increased significantly since the 1970s, but it is still not large enough to be self-sustaining.
  - The current habitat of the Florida panther is not large enough to support more individuals.
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality. - There is no information in the context to support this statement.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining. - This statement contradicts the information in the context, which states that the population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining. - This statement is supported by the information in the context, which states that the current habitat is not large enough to support more individuals.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level. - There is no information in the context to support this statement.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s. - There is no information in the context to support this statement.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment where 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups.

Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  
A: This statement suggests that the patients in the first group may have reported a reduction in pain simply because they knew they were receiving treatment, and not necessarily because the magnets were effective. However, this does not necessarily counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
B: This statement is an opinion and does not provide any evidence to counter the physician's argument.
C: This statement does not necessarily counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain, as it only suggests that there is no evidence to support the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing pain in areas other than the back.
D: This statement does not necessarily counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain, as it only suggests that some of the scientists involved in the experiment had a preconceived belief about the effectiveness of magnetic fields.
E: This statement suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment may have influenced the results, and therefore counters the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.

Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The new program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the number of paychecks issued might not be an accurate estimate of the number of people employed in X. 
  
  A: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
  B: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
  C: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
  D: The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used. However, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the number of paychecks issued might not be an accurate estimate of the number of people employed in X. It is possible that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X to determine the number of people employed.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.

Analysis:
  The new program only counted the number of paychecks issued, not the number of people employed. Therefore, if some workers received more than one paycheck per pay period, the program would overestimate the number of people employed. Since some workers received separate paychecks for different types of pay, the program would count each of those paychecks as a separate employee, leading to an overestimate of the number of people employed.

Action: Answer("D")  
  The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

C: The passage does not provide any information to support this conclusion.
D: The government's new computer program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. If some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions, then the number of paychecks would have been higher than the actual number of employees. Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide 5 years ago, but now it accounts for only 25% of such sales. The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Finally, the argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: This is the correct answer. The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is due to a decline in the total sales of the product. However, it is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased over the past five years, but Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has lost market share to other companies. Therefore, the conclusion that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago is not necessarily true.
  B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them in order to be valid.
  C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers in order to be valid.
  D: The argument assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, so the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years is not relevant to the argument.

A: This choice correctly identifies the flaw in the argument. The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is due to a decline in the total sales of that product. However, it is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased over the past 5 years, and Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales have simply not kept up with the overall market growth. Therefore, the conclusion that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago is not necessarily valid.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them to make its conclusion.
C: The argument only focuses on the sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers, so it is not necessary to discuss sales figures for the company's other products.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Critic: The recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what is of most interest about him. It is by an expert on the history of Elizabethan England, and so does a good job of showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time. But it does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
Question: The conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: There is no way to know what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
  B: The life of the average man in Elizabethan England is uninteresting.
  C: Shakespeare was very different from the other men of his time.
  D: A biography should always focus on what makes its subject distinctive.
  E: What is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
A: This criticism is not relevant to the argument because the argument is not about the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes versus those without such lanes.
B: This criticism is not relevant to the argument because the argument is not about the number of bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes versus those without such lanes.
C: This criticism is not relevant to the argument because the argument is not about the safety of motorists.
D: This criticism is relevant to the argument because the argument is based on the assumption that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the statistics of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes.
E: This criticism is not relevant to the argument because the argument is not based on statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The statements above explain why whipping cream in a blender produces a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. 
  A: This statement is true based on the information given.
  B: This statement is not necessarily true based on the information given. The special attachment can help somewhat, but it may not be enough to fully compensate for the blender's poor air intake.
  C: This statement is not necessarily true based on the information given. The special attachment can help somewhat, but it may not always produce a fluffier result than without using it.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument presents a situation where a healthier diet based on fish protein would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible to adopt the diet universally.
A: The argument presents evidence that taking vitamin E supplements reduces the risk of heart attack, but it has not been established that the supplements are safe for all people. Therefore, it is not recommended that everyone takes vitamin E supplements every day.

Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the statements above?
Choices:
  A: In the city with the worst air pollution today, the air quality is better than it was 30 years ago.
  B: No city has worse air pollution today than it did 30 years ago.
  C: Most of the public outcries against pollution came from people in the cities that had the most polluted air.
  D: The most polluted cities today are not the cities that were the most polluted 30 years ago.
  E: Public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

The statements above suggest that stricter regulations of emissions were put in place in response to public outcries against pollution. As a result, the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. This is the best answer among the given choices.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
The passage states that stricter regulations of emissions were brought about due to public outcries against pollution, and that as a result, the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Choice A cannot be inferred because the passage does not provide information about the city with the worst air pollution today. Choice B is incorrect because the passage only discusses the improvement of air quality in the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago, not the air quality of all cities. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about where the public outcries against pollution came from. Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about the most polluted cities today.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage states that public outcries against pollution have brought about stricter regulations of emissions and that the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. This implies that the public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Therefore, the correct answer is E. 

A cannot be inferred because the passage does not provide information about the city with the worst air pollution today.
B cannot be inferred because the passage only talks about the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago, not about the cities with the worst air pollution today.
C cannot be inferred because the passage does not provide information about where most of the public outcries against pollution came from.
D cannot be inferred because the passage does not provide information about which cities are the most polluted today.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage states that public outcries against pollution led to stricter regulations of emissions, which in turn led to greatly improved air quality in the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about the city with the worst air pollution today. Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about all cities, only those that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about where the public outcries against pollution came from. Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about the most polluted cities today.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

The statements above suggest that stricter regulations of emissions have led to improved air quality in the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. This implies that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of these cities. Therefore, the correct answer is E. 

A is incorrect because the statements do not provide information about the city with the worst air pollution today. 

B is incorrect because the statements do not provide information about all cities, only the ones that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. 

C is incorrect because the statements do not provide information about where the public outcries against pollution came from. 

D is incorrect because the statements do not provide information about the most polluted cities today.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage states that public outcries against pollution led to stricter regulations of emissions, which in turn led to improved air quality in the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Choice A cannot be inferred, as the passage does not provide information about the city with the worst air pollution today. Choice B is incorrect, as the passage does not provide information about all cities. Choice C is not necessarily true, as the passage does not provide information about where the public outcries against pollution came from. Choice D is also incorrect, as the passage does not provide information about the most polluted cities today.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: The passage states that public outcries against pollution led to stricter regulations of emissions, which in turn led to greatly improved air quality in the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not a good way to increase productivity because other things in the office can be distracting too.
A: This argument is about moderation and how it fails to take into account biological differences.
B: This argument is about banning an electronic device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals, but most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses.
C: This argument is about Acme needing to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year.
D: This argument is about how engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the creative writing industry.
E: This argument is about how judging a film's success in terms of its profit relative to its cost is misguided because an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not necessarily helpful in increasing productivity, as other office features such as windows or decorations can also be distracting. 
A: The argument is about how different people react differently to substances, and therefore moderation cannot be defined in a universal way. This argument is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
B: The argument is about how some chemicals can cause cancer in high doses, but we don't ban them all, so we shouldn't ban the electronic device. This argument is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
C: The argument is about how Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 employees are expected to retire. This argument is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
D: The argument is about how engaging characters do not guarantee a sale, as publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. This argument is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
E: The argument is about how judging a movie's success solely in terms of its profit relative to its cost is misguided, as an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie. This argument is similar in reasoning to the employee's argument, as both arguments critique a narrow and incomplete way of measuring success. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not a good way to increase productivity because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, can also be distracting and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.

C: This argument is about how Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
D: This argument is about how engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the creative writing industry. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
E: This argument is about how judging a film's success in terms of its profit relative to its cost is misguided in the movie industry. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
The employee argues that the company's claim that non-work-related websites are distracting and keep employees from doing their best work is flawed because other things in the office can also be distracting, but are not restricted.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence. 
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods compared to non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

A: The argument is not concerned with the trend of fiber consumption, but with the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer incidence. Therefore, this choice is irrelevant.
B: This choice is irrelevant because the argument is only concerned with the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer incidence.
C: The argument does not address the difficulty of including fiber in one's diet, but rather the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer incidence. Therefore, this choice is irrelevant.
D: The argument does not distinguish between the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals. Therefore, this choice is irrelevant.
E: This choice provides an alternative explanation for the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer incidence. It suggests that other substances in foods containing fiber may be responsible for preventing colon cancer. Therefore, this choice is a valid criticism of the argument.

Action: Answer("E")

The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: The argument does not discuss whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably or not. This is not relevant to the argument's conclusion.
B: The argument does not discuss whether high-fiber diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer or not. This is not relevant to the argument's conclusion.
C: The argument does not discuss whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets or not. This is not relevant to the argument's conclusion.
D: The argument does not discuss whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees or not. This is not relevant to the argument's conclusion.
E: This choice is relevant to the argument's conclusion. The argument overlooks the possibility that foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer. Therefore, it is possible that the correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer is not as straightforward as the argument suggests. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. It cites studies that show a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rates. It also notes that in Scandinavia, areas with lower consumption of cereals (which are high in fiber) have higher colon cancer rates.
A: The argument is not concerned with whether the consumption of fiber is rising or falling in many countries, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.
C: This choice is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.
E: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument because it suggests that other substances in foods containing fiber may be responsible for the negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rates, rather than fiber itself.

Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables. The argument further claims that in Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fiber. Finally, the argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning because the argument is not concerned with changes in fiber consumption over time.
B: This choice is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning because the argument is specifically about colon cancer and its relationship to fiber consumption.
C: This choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning because the argument does not claim that everyone must consume fiber to prevent colon cancer. Rather, it claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning because the argument does not compare the cancer-fighting properties of different types of fiber. Rather, it claims that fiber consumption is negatively correlated with colon cancer rates.
E: This choice is the most likely answer because it suggests that the argument overlooks the possibility that other substances in fiber-rich foods may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, rather than fiber itself. This would weaken the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables.

  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

Action: Answer("D")
The argument overlooks the possibility that the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees. This could mean that the relationship between fther and colon cancer is more complex than the argument suggests.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not does not affect the argument's conclusion.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument is specifically about the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer, not other types of cancer.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument does not address whether or not it is difficult for many people to include fiber in their diets.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument does not address the different levels of cancer-fighting properties of fiber in different foods.
E: This statement is a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning. The argument assumes that it is the fiber in foods that prevents colon cancer, but it overlooks the possibility that other substances in foods containing fiber may also contribute to preventing colon cancer.

  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that the colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods. In Scandinavia, it has been shown that the higher the colon cancer rate, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not does not affect the argument's conclusion.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument only focuses on the relationship between fiber and colon cancer, not other types of cancer.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument does not discuss the difficulty of including fiber in people's diets.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument does not compare the cancer-fighting properties of fiber in fruits and vegetables to the fiber in cereals.
E: This statement is the most likely answer. The argument does not consider the possibility that other substances in foods containing fiber may also play a role in preventing colon cancer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that the colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods. In Scandinavia, it has been shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  
A: The argument is not concerned with whether the consumption of fiber is rising or falling in many countries, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument because the argument is only concerned with the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer, not the risk of other types of cancer.
C: The argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not address the degree to which different types of fiber have cancer-fighting properties, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
E: This choice is relevant to the argument because it suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods may be responsible for the observed correlation between high-fiber diets and reduced colon cancer rates.

Action: Answer("E")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known
  E: takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information

  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group.
  The representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed on the document.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The journalist's reasoning is flawed because the journalist does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group. It is possible that Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group but was not included in the document for some reason. Therefore, the conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group is not necessarily valid.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether they are in captivity or in the wild.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
C: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
D: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
E: If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, then it is possible that captive leatherbacks are not actually living as long as they appear to be. This could help explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity that they would not encounter in the wild.
  The passage also states that the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is about the same in captivity and in the wild.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
C: This statement provides some information about the causes of death for leatherbacks in the wild, but it does not help to resolve the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
D: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
E: This statement could help to resolve the discrepancy. If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, then it is possible that captive leatherbacks are not actually living as long as they appear to be, and this could explain why their life expectancy is similar to that of wild leatherbacks.

  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
  C: This statement does not explain why the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity is similar to that of leatherbacks in the wild.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
  E: This statement could help to explain the apparent discrepancy, as it suggests that the size of a leatherback might not accurately reflect its age, making it difficult to compare the life expectancy of captive and wild leatherbacks.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity that they would not encounter in the wild, yet their likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy presented in the passage.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy presented in the passage.
  C: This statement provides a possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy. If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then it is possible that the leatherbacks that survive to reach their maximum life expectancy in the wild are those that are not susceptible to predators and diseases. In captivity, the leatherbacks are not exposed to predators, so the ones that survive are those that are not susceptible to diseases.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy presented in the passage.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy presented in the passage.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well

Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.

Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals.

Knowledge: The argument above assumes that the economic theories of the party were flawed because the inflation rate increased instead of decreasing as it should have if the theories were correct.
A: The argument assumes that the architecture in the valley would have changed if the valley people were invaded or if there was a dramatic climatic change. This is a flawed assumption because there could be other reasons why the architecture remained the same.
B: The argument assumes that the workers will not strike because they promised not to strike. This is a flawed assumption because the workers may still strike if the party keeps its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
C: The argument assumes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries because the stock price did not increase. This is a flawed assumption because there could be other reasons why the stock price did not increase.
D: The argument assumes that the rebels won the battle because the city residents showed support for the rebels. This is a flawed assumption because the residents could be showing support for other reasons.
E: The argument assumes that the new weather forecasting equipment is not an improvement on the old because the station's ratings decreased. This is a flawed assumption because there could be other reasons why the ratings decreased.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above assumes that the party's economic theories were sound, but this is not necessarily true.
  The argument also assumes that the party's failure to lessen inflation means that its economic theories were completely wrong.
  A: This argument assumes that the only reason architecture would change is if the valley people were invaded or if there was a climatic change, but there could be other reasons for architectural changes.
  B: This argument assumes that the workers promised not to strike because they do not believe the party will keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut, but there could be other reasons for the workers' promise.
  C: This argument assumes that the only way the company could have doubled its stock price is by selling its subsidiaries and purchasing the new patent, but there could be other ways for the company to increase its stock price.
  D: This argument assumes that the only reason city residents would show support for the rebels is if they won the battle and freed the jailed rebel leaders, but there could be other reasons for the residents' support.
  E: This argument assumes that the only way the television station's new weather forecasting equipment could be an improvement is if its accuracy increased and its ratings rose, but there could be other factors affecting the ratings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above states that if the party's economic theories had been sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened, but since the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  A: This argument presents a conditional statement that if the people who inhabited the valley had been invaded or if there had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture. However, since the architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay, the argument concludes that the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay. This argument is flawed because it presents a false dichotomy.
  B: This argument presents a conditional statement that if the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. However, since the workers have promised not to strike, the argument concludes that these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This argument is flawed because it presents a false cause.
  C: This argument presents a conditional statement that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. However, since the price of the stock did not increase in that time, the argument concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This argument is flawed because it presents a false cause.
  D: This argument presents a conditional statement that city residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels if the battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. However, since residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days, the argument concludes that the rebels must have won the battle. This argument is flawed because it presents a false cause.
  E: This argument presents a conditional statement that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. However, since the station's ratings actually decreased, the argument concludes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This argument is flawed because it presents a false cause.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument presented in the context is that the party's economic theories were flawed because the inflation rate increased instead of decreasing as predicted.
A: The argument presents a conditional statement that if the people were invaded or if there was a climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture. But the architecture remained the same, so the conclusion is that the people were not invaded. This argument is flawed because it assumes that there are no other reasons why the architecture would remain the same.
B: The argument presents a conditional statement that if the opposition party wins the election and cuts wages, workers in key industries will strike. But the workers have promised not to strike, so the conclusion is that the workers do not believe the party will keep its promise. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the workers' promise not to strike is based solely on their belief that the party will not keep its promise.
C: The argument presents a conditional statement that if the company had sold its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled. But the stock price did not increase, so the conclusion is that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason the stock price did not increase is that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries.
D: The argument presents a conditional statement that if the rebels won the battle and the jailed leaders were freed, city residents would show a great deal of support for the rebels. Residents have shown a great deal of support for the last three days, so the conclusion is that the rebels won the battle. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason residents are showing support is that the rebels won the battle.
E: The argument presents a conditional statement that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment was worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings.

This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason the ratings decreased is that the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that because the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were flawed.
Choices:
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of changes in the valley's architecture means that the valley people were never invaded, without considering other possible reasons for the lack of changes.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the workers' promise not to strike means that they do not fear a dramatic wage cut, without considering other possible reasons for their promise.
  C: This argument is similar to the given argument because it assumes that the absence of an expected outcome (doubling of the stock price) means that a specific cause (failure to sell subsidiaries) did not occur, without considering other possible reasons for the absence of the expected outcome.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the residents' support for the rebels means that the rebels won the battle, without considering other possible reasons for the residents' support.
  E: This argument is similar to the given argument because it assumes that the absence of an expected outcome (increase in ratings) means that a specific cause (new weather forecasting equipment) did not have the expected effect, without considering other possible reasons for the absence of the expected outcome.

E: The argument presents a conditional statement that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. But since the station's ratings actually decreased, the argument concludes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This argument is similar to the argument in the context because it presents a false cause and effect relationship and assumes that the only possible explanation for the decrease in ratings is the ineffectiveness of the new equipment.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

  B: This principle suggests that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations, which supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  C: This principle suggests that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found, which does not support either position.
  D: This principle suggests that environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment, which supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  E: This principle suggests that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources, which supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.

C: This principle suggests that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. However, the columnist's argument is that even if a bill is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it may not be passed into law if those who oppose it are very influential.
D: This principle suggests that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights. However, the columnist's argument is not about bills that violate basic human rights, but rather bills that do not violate basic human rights but are still not passed into law due to the influence of those who oppose it.
E: This principle suggests that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that humans' five fingers are not inherently better than other possible configurations, such as six fingers. The argument is based on the idea that our current configuration is a result of evolution and not a reflection of any inherent superiority. 
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. The argument is not about whether people are content with their fingers or not. 
  B: This statement is not true. People are often content with things that are less useful than other options. For example, people may prefer a less efficient but more aesthetically pleasing car. 
  C: This statement is a generalization that is not always true. People may have different preferences and opinions about things of equal usefulness. 
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument. The argument is that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is influenced by our prejudices, and this statement suggests that our perception of usefulness may not be accurate. 
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. The argument is not about whether a species of fish had six phalanges or not. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if we had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins. The argument implies that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not inherent, but rather a result of our evolutionary history. 
  A: This statement does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are always content with things of equal usefulness.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not inherent, but rather a result of our prejudices.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that at least one species of fish had a different number of phalanges in its fins than the one proposed by the biologist.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that humans' configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, and that humans would be just as content with a different configuration if they had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
  A: This statement does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are content with things of equal usefulness.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective evidence.
  E: This statement does not directly support the biologist's argument, but it does provide evidence that a different configuration of fingers is possible in nature.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have been content with six fingers if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins. 
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument by stating that humans are not equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement supports the biologist's argument by stating that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness. However, it is too strong of a statement to be considered as the best answer.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by stating that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument by stating that at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, which suggests that humans could have had six fingers if we had descended from that species of fish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers we have is not necessarily the most useful or optimal configuration, and that humans would be equally content with other configurations.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the biologist is not claiming that everyone is content with the current configuration.
  B: This statement weakens the argument, as it suggests that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement supports the argument, but it does not strengthen it, as it simply restates the biologist's claim.
  D: This statement supports the argument, as it suggests that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective criteria.
  E: This statement strengthens the argument, as it provides evidence that the biologist's claim is not purely hypothetical and that other species have evolved with different numbers of phalanges.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations, and that humans would be content with any configuration if that was what they had evolved with.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument that the number of fingers is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.
  B: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement supports the biologist's argument, but it is not necessary to strengthen it.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on any objective measure, but rather on our subjective perceptions.
  E: This statement is relevant to the biologist's argument because it suggests that there are other possible configurations of fingers that could have evolved. If there are multiple examples of fish with different numbers of phalanges in their fins, it strengthens the argument that the number of fingers humans have is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.

  The biologist argues that the number of fingers we have is not necessarily the only or the best configuration for our hands, and that we would be just as content with a different number of fingers if we had evolved from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the argument is not about whether people are content with the number of fingers they have, but rather about the possibility of being content with a different number of fingers.
  B: This statement weakens the argument, as it suggests that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness, which would imply that a different configuration of fingers would not be equally useful and therefore not equally content.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the argument is not about whether people are always equally content with things of equal usefulness, but rather about the possibility of being content with a different number of fingers.
  D: This statement supports the argument, as it suggests that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective criteria but rather on our prejudices, which implies that a different configuration of fingers could be just as useful and therefore just as content.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the argument is not about whether a species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, but rather about the possibility of being content with a different number of fingers.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Question: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  - The works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  - Prints of all the museum's permanent collection works are available in the museum store.
  - The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  
  A: The statement is not true because the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: The statement is true because the museum displays only twentieth-century works and prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
  C: The statement is not true because the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  D: The statement is not necessarily true. The fact that Hopper's Nighthawks is sold in the museum store does not mean that it is on loan to the museum from a private collector. 
  E: The statement does not necessarily follow from the curator's statements. The fact that Hopper's Nighthawks is sold in the museum store does not mean that it is not displayed in the museum.

Knowledge:
  - The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  - The works displayed in the museum are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  - Prints of all of the museum's permanent collection works are available in the museum store.
  - The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The curator's statements imply that all of the prints sold in the museum store are of twentieth-century works, either from the museum's permanent collection or on loan from private collectors. However, it is not necessarily true that every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection (choice A). It is also not necessarily true that there are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector (choice C). The curator did not provide any information about whether Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection, so it is not necessarily true that it is both (choice D). Finally, the curator did not provide any information about whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum, so it is not necessarily true that it is not displayed in the museum (choice E). Therefore, the only statement that must be true based on the curator's statements is that every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work (choice B).

Explanation: 
  - Choice A is not necessarily true because the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  - Choice B is true because the curator stated that the museum displays only twentieth-century works and prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
  - Choice C is not necessarily true because the curator did not state that prints of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector are available in the museum store.
  - Choice D is not necessarily true because the curator did not state that Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan to the museum from a private collector.

  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  
  A: The museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, so this statement cannot be true.

  - The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The curator's statements imply that every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work, which is either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. However, the statements do not imply that every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection (A is not necessarily true).

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.
Response 0:

Therefore, Oblicek should not be blamed for her brother's business going bankrupt due to the loan.
C: Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, but he had no reason to think that it would. Therefore, Gougon should not be blamed for his guests getting ill from the hollandaise sauce.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know that giving his patient the wrong medicine would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for the patient's increase in blood pressure.
E: A reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

A: Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. Thus, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. Thus, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know that giving his patient the wrong medicine would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Thus, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm. Any reasonable person could have foreseen that this would start a fire. Thus, Kapp is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.
Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.

  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust.
  A: This weakens the geologist's argument, but it does not directly address the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  B: This is true, but it does not directly address the geologist's argument.
  C: This supports the geologist's argument, as it suggests that it would take a long time for petroleum to form from deep carbon deposits.
  D: This is not relevant to the geologist's argument.
  E: This weakens the geologist's argument, as it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which supports the alternative theory.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
- The opposing scientists argue that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
- The geologist's argument is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum, indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
- The question asks for the option that weakens the geologist's argument the most.

Analysis:
- Option A is irrelevant because it does not address the formation of petroleum.
- Option B is also irrelevant because it does not address the formation of petroleum.
- Option C supports the opposing scientists' argument that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
- Option D is irrelevant because it does not address the formation of petroleum.
- Option E weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which supports the opposing scientists' argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that the person has an immunity to infection by this microorganism. However, this assumption may not be true in all cases because some people may have a weakened immune system or other factors that make them more susceptible to infection.
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors washing their hands less often than other health care professionals means that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to the microorganism. This assumption is flawed because it does not consider the possibility that the person's immune system may have fought off the infection, or that the person may have been exposed to a non-harmful strain of the microorganism. 
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which may not be true.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which may not be true.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which may not be true.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which may not be true.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors' hand-washing habits are the only factor affecting the value of the procedure in preventing disease, which may not be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to a microorganism without developing harmful symptoms means that the person has an immunity to that microorganism. This assumption is not necessarily true, as some people may have other factors that prevent them from developing harmful symptoms. 
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors not washing their hands often means that hand washing is not effective in preventing disease, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is based on a flawed pattern of reasoning called "affirming the consequent". This pattern of reasoning occurs when we assume that if a certain condition is true, then a particular result will follow. When we observe that the result has occurred, we assume that the condition must have been true. However, this is not necessarily the case, since there may be other factors that could have produced the same result.
  A: This argument is based on a flawed pattern of reasoning called "equivocation". The term "just" is used in two different senses in the argument, so the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises.
  B: This argument is based on a flawed pattern of reasoning called "false analogy". The fact that advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true does not imply that writers of fiction do the same thing.
  C: This argument is based on a flawed pattern of reasoning called "false dichotomy". The fact that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms does not imply that Isabel did not take the medication.
  D: This argument is based on a flawed pattern of reasoning called "post hoc ergo propter hoc". The fact that business owners are less willing to expand their businesses does not necessarily imply that their taxes are too high.
  E: This argument is based on a flawed pattern of reasoning called "hasty generalization". The fact that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals does not imply that hand washing cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has immunity to the microorganism. This assumption is not necessarily true, as some people may have developed immunity, while others may not have been exposed to a harmful strain of the microorganism.
A: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the fallacy of the undistributed middle, where the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed to either the major or minor term. 
B: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the fallacy of the excluded middle, where only two options are presented as if they are the only possibilities, when in fact there may be other options. 
C: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the non sequitur fallacy, where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. 
D: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the post hoc fallacy, where a causal relationship is assumed between two events based on their temporal sequence alone. 
E: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the hasty generalization fallacy, where a conclusion is drawn based on insufficient evidence. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The student's argument is that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus is the only factor that determines whether someone develops harmful symptoms or not. There could be other factors, such as the person's immune system, that also play a role.
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.

Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has immunity to the microorganism. This assumption may not be true, as some people may be carriers of the microorganism without showing symptoms.
A: This argument is flawed because it equates moral rightness with serving the interests of everyone, which is not necessarily true.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which may not be true.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which may not be true.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which may not be true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms implies immunity to infection by this microorganism, which is not necessarily true.
  A: The argument is not about morality or justice.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

This may explain why workers who report the least control over their own work have a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome, as they may be doing more typing than workers who have more control over their own work.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  A: This choice does not explain the study's findings because it talks about the amount of typing done by workers with different levels of control over their own work, but it does not explain why those with the least control have a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  B: This choice provides a possible explanation for the study's findings by suggesting that feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: This choice does not explain the study's findings because it talks about the keyboards on which office workers type, but it does not explain why those with the least control have a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This choice is not relevant to the study's findings because it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards, which is not the focus of the study.
  E: This choice does not explain the study's findings because it talks about repetitive motions other than typing, but the study specifically focuses on the effects of typing on the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In marketing their products, drug companies often send gifts to physicians. According to a recent survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument is about the feeding habits of Diplodocus, a dinosaur. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation. Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones, not on the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is about Diplodocus's feeding habits, not its vision.
C: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is about Diplodocus's feeding habits, not its brain or blood supply.
D: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation, so it is not necessary to assume that it had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is required by the argument. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation, but does not consider the possibility that Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument presents evidence that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but could have bent its neck downward and even extended it below ground level to access underwater vegetation. 

A: The argument does not rely on the assumption that the same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not rely on the assumption that Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
C: The argument does not rely on the assumption that it would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
D: The argument does not rely on the assumption that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
E: The argument does not rely on the assumption that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument states that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater because the structure of its neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
A: The argument does not require this assumption.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's ability to see in front of itself.
C: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's brain or its blood supply.
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: The argument assumes that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, as it states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument states that computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the dinosaur from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but that the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

A: This statement is not required by the argument.
B: This statement is not required by the argument.
C: This statement is not required by the argument.
D: This statement is not required by the argument.
E: This statement is not required by the argument.

Action: Answer(None of the above)
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This statement is not necessary for the argument, as the argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access vegetation.
  E: This statement is relevant to the argument, as it suggests that Diplodocus did not have other ways of accessing underwater vegetation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but that it could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing it to access underwater vegetation from dry land. The passage does not provide information to support any of the answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from browsing for high-growing vegetation by raising its neck. However, the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: The argument does not require this assumption.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision.
C: The argument does not discuss blood supply to the brain of Diplodocus.
D: The argument does not state that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is required by the argument. If Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then the argument's conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater, would not be valid.
Action: Answer("E")

The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the dinosaur from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation. Instead, the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

A: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones, not the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision. This assumption is not required by the argument.
C: The argument does not discuss the blood supply to Diplodocus's brain. This assumption is not required by the argument.
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation. It only suggests that the structure of its neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is required by the argument. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not consider the possibility that Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The speaker's social circle may not be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument's conclusion that the official results must be rigged is not necessarily true.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The speaker is making a hasty generalization based on a non-representative sample. Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is based on the premise that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal, and therefore, the official results must be rigged. However, this is a hasty generalization. The speaker is using evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Therefore, the most accurate description of the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A is the correct answer.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is based on the premise that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal, which is not a representative sample of the general population. The fact that the speaker's acquaintances voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument uses evidence drawn from a small sample of people that the speaker knows, which is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The official results of the national referendum indicate that 80 percent of people voted in favor of the proposal, which is a much larger sample size and more likely to be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it relies on evidence that is not representative of the population as a whole.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses anecdotal evidence (personal experience) to claim that the official results must be rigged. This is a logical fallacy because personal experience is not a reliable indicator of the views of the general population. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A best describes this flaw.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument uses a small, non-representative sample (the people the speaker knows) to make a sweeping claim about the entire population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it relies on an unreliable sample. Choice A accurately describes this flaw.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that the people the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The speaker is drawing a conclusion based on a non-representative sample, which is a common flaw in reasoning. Therefore, option A is the most accurate description of the flaw in the argument.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is based on the personal experience of the speaker and their acquaintances, which is a small and biased sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the person knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. This is a classic example of a biased sample, where the sample is not representative of the population as a whole. Therefore, the argument's conclusion is not supported by the evidence presented. Choice A is the best answer because it accurately describes the flaw in the reasoning of the argument. The other answer choices do not accurately describe the flaw in the reasoning of the argument.

Context: Inez: The book we are reading, The Nature of Matter, is mistitled. A title should summarize the content of the whole book, but nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy. Antonio: I do not think that the author erred; according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the conversation above?
Choices:
  A: Inez believes that the book should be called The Nature of Energy.
  B: Antonio believes that there are no differences between matter and energy.

  E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez believes that the book we are reading is mistitled because nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing a different subject: energy.
  Antonio disagrees with Inez and thinks that the author did not err because matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning:
  Inez's argument is that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, since energy is a significant part of the book. Antonio's argument is that matter and energy are closely related and should be considered together. Therefore, the most strongly supported option is E, which summarizes Inez's argument that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. 

Answer: E
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez believes that the book's title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book.
  Antonio disagrees with Inez and believes that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning:
  Inez's statement implies that the book should include energy in its title if it is going to discuss it so extensively. This is supported by her statement that "nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy."
  Antonio's statement does not support any of the answer choices, as he does not say that there are no differences between matter and energy.
  Inez and Antonio do not disagree on whether matter and energy are related, as Antonio's statement implies that they are related.
  There is no evidence in the conversation that Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book.
  Therefore, the best answer is E, which accurately summarizes Inez's belief that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez believes that the book's title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book.
  Antonio believes that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning:
  Inez's statement suggests that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, as nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing energy.
  Antonio's statement supports the idea that matter and energy are related, but it does not suggest that there are no differences between them.
  
Answer("E") is the best answer because it accurately reflects Inez's belief that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez believes that the book's title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book.
  Antonio believes that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
  
Reasoning:
  Inez's statement implies that she thinks the book's title should include both matter and energy, not just matter. Therefore, option A is not correct.
  Antonio's statement implies that he thinks matter and energy are closely related, not that they are the same thing. Therefore, option B is not correct.
  Inez and Antonio both agree that matter and energy are related, so option C is not correct.
  There is no indication that Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book, so option D is not correct.
  Inez's statement supports the idea that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, so option E is correct. 

Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
Inez argues that the book's title is mistitled because it does not mention energy, which is a closely related subject that takes up nearly half of the book. Antonio disagrees and thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Therefore, the conversation suggests that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, which is most strongly supported by choice E.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez thinks that the book's title is mistitled because it only mentions matter and not energy, which is also discussed in the book.
  Antonio thinks that the author did not err because matter and energy are related.
  
Reasoning: 
  Inez and Antonio do not disagree on whether matter and energy are related, but rather on the title of the book. Inez thinks that the title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, while Antonio thinks that the author did not err because matter and energy are related. Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
  
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez argues that the book's title is mistitled and that it should not summarize only half of the content of the book.
  Antonio disagrees with Inez and thinks that the author did not err because matter and energy are closely related.

Reasoning:
  Inez's argument is about the title of the book and how it does not fully represent the content of the book. She does not argue that the book should be called "The Nature of Energy" instead. 
  Antonio's argument is about the relationship between matter and energy and how they are related.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. 

Answer: E
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez believes that the book's title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book.

  The argument in the consumer magazine is that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers, so to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers.
  A: The argument does not mention anything about top-loading washing machines using the same amount of water.
  B: The argument does not mention anything about a laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolving more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
  C: The argument implies that a laundry detergent specially formulated for front-loading washers is needed to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, but it does not say that this is the only way to get clothes really clean in any washing machine.
  D: The argument implies that a laundry detergent that dissolves readily in a washer is needed to get clothes really clean in that washer, but it does not say that this is the only way to get clothes really clean in any washing machine.

Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers because they use less water than top-loading washers. Therefore, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine.

A: The argument does not depend on the amount of water used by top-loading washing machines, so this assumption is not required.
B: The argument is about the effectiveness of detergents in front-loading washers, not about their solubility in top-loading washers, so this assumption is not required.
C: The argument does not make a claim about the effectiveness of laundry detergents in general, so this assumption is not required.
D: This assumption is required by the argument, because the argument is based on the claim that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers and therefore does not get clothes really clean in them.
E: This assumption is not required by the argument, because the argument is not about the relative effectiveness of washers that use different amounts of water.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.

  The passage describes two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast.
  In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  Horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
  Both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.

Analysis:
  A: The passage does not state that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature. It only states that some horror stories about monstrous beasts symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  B: The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. However, it does not state that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: The passage states that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. However, it does not state that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: The passage states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, it does not state that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature. It also states that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Therefore, it is possible that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, based on a comparison of two groups of joggers.
  A: This statement provides additional information about the rate of jogging injuries, but it does not directly weaken the researcher's argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.

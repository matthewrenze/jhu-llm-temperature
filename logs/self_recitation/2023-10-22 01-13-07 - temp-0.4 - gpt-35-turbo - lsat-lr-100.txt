### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five competing colas tasted.
  A: This choice criticizes the advertisement for not considering the possibility that the generalization may not be true for each of the five smaller groups.
  B: This choice criticizes the advertisement for assuming that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola over the other colas tasted.
  C: This choice criticizes the advertisement for not considering the possibility that some cola not tested may have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This choice criticizes the advertisement for not considering the possibility that people may prefer Sparkle Cola for reasons other than its taste.
  E: This choice criticizes the advertisement for not testing other types of beverages.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested. 
  A: This choice is a valid criticism because the study only tested five smaller groups, and it is possible that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: This choice is not a valid criticism because the advertisement does not assume that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted. It only claims that most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  C: This choice is a valid criticism because the study only tested five competing colas, and it is possible that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This choice is a valid criticism because the advertisement overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: This choice is not a valid criticism because the advertisement is not claiming that Sparkle Cola is the best beverage overall, only that it elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted in a study.
  A: This is not a vulnerability in the reasoning of the advertisement.
  B: This is not a vulnerability in the reasoning of the advertisement.
  C: This is a possible vulnerability in the reasoning of the advertisement, as it overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This is not a vulnerability in the reasoning of the advertisement, as it does not contradict the claim made in the advertisement.
  E: This is not a vulnerability in the reasoning of the advertisement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The study involved blindfolded volunteers tasting Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas.
  Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
A: This choice criticizes the generalization made about the entire group of volunteers based on the preference of each smaller group.
B: This choice criticizes the assumption that the preference of the volunteers in the study would translate to real-world situations.
C: This choice criticizes the possibility that there may be other colas that are more preferred than Sparkle Cola, which were not tested in the study.
D: This choice criticizes the possibility that the preference for Sparkle Cola may not be solely based on its taste but rather on other factors such as packaging or price.
E: This choice is irrelevant to the reasoning presented in the advertisement as it criticizes the study's scope rather than the reasoning itself.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted in a carefully controlled study.
  A: This choice raises a concern about the generalizability of the study results to the population as a whole, but it does not directly criticize the reasoning in the advertisement.
  B: This choice raises a concern about the external validity of the study results, but it does not directly criticize the reasoning in the advertisement.
  C: This choice raises a concern about the generalizability of the study results to the population as a whole, but it does not directly criticize the reasoning in the advertisement.
  D: This choice is a valid criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement because it suggests that the preference for Sparkle Cola may not be solely based on its taste.
  E: This choice is not relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement because it does not directly address the study results.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The study divided blindfolded volunteers into five groups and each group tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
A: This choice suggests that the generalization made about the entire group may not be true of the five smaller groups. However, the advertisement clearly states that each group tasted a different cola, so this criticism is not valid.
B: This choice suggests that the advertisement takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola, but the advertisement does not make any such assumption.
C: This choice suggests that there might be another cola that would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. However, the advertisement only claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than any of the competing colas tested.
D: This choice suggests that people may prefer Sparkle Cola for reasons other than its taste, but the advertisement is only concerned with the taste preference of the volunteers.

Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above uses a flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent. It assumes that if A then B, and B is observed, then A must be true. This is a logical fallacy because there could be other reasons for B to occur.
  A: This argument does not use affirming the consequent. It uses a valid pattern of reasoning called modus ponens. If A then B, A is observed, therefore B is true.
  B: This argument uses affirming the consequent, which is the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above.
  C: This argument does not use affirming the consequent. It assumes that car owners are aware of the fact that neglecting to check tire pressure regularly causes premature tire wear, which may not be true for all car owners.
  D: This argument uses affirming the consequent, which is the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above.
  E: This argument introduces a new factor (driving on gravel roads) that can cause premature tire wear, so it is not using affirming the consequent.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument above is a conditional statement in the form "If P, then Q".
  It also uses the contrapositive of the conditional statement, which is "If not Q, then not P".
  The flawed pattern of reasoning is that it assumes that the contrapositive is equivalent to the original conditional statement, which is not always the case.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument above is an example of a flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent. It assumes that if a condition is sufficient for an effect, then the effect is necessary for the condition. This is not always true.
  A: This argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument in the context.
  B: This argument has the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument in the context.
  C: This argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument in the context.
  D: This argument has the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument in the context.
  E: This argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument in the context.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above presents a conditional statement in the form of "If A, then B". It then presents a second conditional statement "If not A, then not B", which is a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the inverse error. 
  A: This argument presents a conditional statement in the form of "If A, then B", but it does not present a flawed pattern of reasoning.
  B: This argument presents a conditional statement in the form of "If A, then B", and it presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the converse error.
  C: This argument presents a conditional statement in the form of "If A, then B", and it presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the denying the antecedent error.
  D: This argument presents a conditional statement in the form of "If A, then B", and it presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the converse error.
  E: This argument presents two conditional statements, but it does not present a flawed pattern of reasoning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument above is an example of flawed reasoning in which the conclusion is based on a conditional statement that has been reversed.
  A: The argument presents a valid conditional statement and concludes that checking the tire pressure regularly will prevent premature tire wear. It is not similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
  B: The argument presents a valid conditional statement and concludes that neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly will cause premature tire wear. It is not similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
  C: The argument presents a valid conditional statement and concludes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure. It is not similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
  D: The argument presents a valid conditional statement and concludes that neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly will cause premature tire wear. It is similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above because it reverses the conditional statement.
  E: The argument presents a valid conditional statement and concludes that keeping the tire pressure from becoming too low will not help a tire last longer if it is often driven on gravel roads. It is not similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as affirming the consequent. The argument assumes that if P then Q, and Q is true, then P must be true. This is a logical fallacy.
  A: This argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as denying the antecedent. The argument assumes that if P then Q, and P is false, then Q must be false. This is a logical fallacy.
  B: This argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as denying the antecedent. The argument assumes that if P then Q, and P is false, then Q must be false. This is a logical fallacy.
  C: This argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as assuming the conclusion. The argument assumes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure, without providing evidence to support this claim.
  D: This argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as denying the antecedent. The argument assumes that if P then Q, and P is false, then Q must be false. This is a logical fallacy.
  E: This argument presents a different flawed pattern of reasoning, known as the fallacy of the undistributed middle. The argument assumes that if P then Q, and R also leads to Q, then R must lead to P. This is a logical fallacy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because it lacks a protective cover. It ignores other possible factors that might affect the attraction of birds to the feeder.
  A: This argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above. It is a valid argument that suggests a way to prevent premature tire wear.
  B: This argument has the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above. It assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is that the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly. It ignores other possible factors that might affect tire wear.
  C: This argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above. It suggests a solution to a problem, rather than making an unsupported assumption.
  D: This argument has the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above. It assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is that the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly. It ignores other possible factors that might affect tire wear.
  E: This argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above. It acknowledges that there are other factors that might affect tire wear, and suggests that low tire pressure is not the only factor that affects tire wear.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:

Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.

Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.

  E: This choice criticizes the psychologist's argument for presuming, without providing justification, that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The psychologist argues that doctors should not prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia, and instead, psychotherapy should be used to alleviate the stress causing their insomnia. 
  A: This choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning by suggesting that the psychologist presumes, without providing warrant, that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress. However, the argument does not make this presumption.
  B: This choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning by suggesting that the argument fails to consider the possibility that sedatives are the only treatment known to be effective for cases of insomnia not caused by stress. However, the argument does not make this claim.
  C: This choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning by suggesting that the argument neglects the possibility that for some people psychotherapy is a completely ineffective treatment for stress. This is a possible flaw in the argument.
  D: This choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning by suggesting that the argument overlooks the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress. This is a possible flaw in the argument.
  E: This choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning by suggesting that the argument presumes, without providing justification, that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia. This is a possible flaw in the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors led to a substantial decrease in patient injuries resulting from staff errors at several regional hospitals. The argument suggests that the knowledge that their errors were being monitored made the hospitals' staffs more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  
A: This statement provides information about the hospitals' policy before the plan was implemented, but it does not provide any information that strengthens or weakens the argument. 
B: This statement suggests that factors other than the implementation of the plan may have contributed to the decrease in patient injuries at the regional hospital that did not participate in the plan. Therefore, this statement weakens the argument.
C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
D: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in the incidence of the injuries began only after the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
E: This statement provides information about the consequences of staff errors but does not provide any information that strengthens or weakens the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors led to a decrease in the incidence of patient injuries at several regional hospitals. The reason for this decrease is that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.

A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. It does not provide any information about the effect of the plan on the incidence of patient injuries.
B: This statement weakens the argument. If the incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question, it suggests that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries at the hospitals that participated in the plan may have been due to factors other than the implementation of the plan.
C: This statement weakens the argument. If the plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not, it suggests that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries may have been due to factors other than the implementation of the plan.
D: This statement strengthens the argument. If the decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, it suggests that the implementation of the plan was responsible for the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. It does not provide any information about the effect of the plan on the incidence of patient injuries.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the systematic recording of staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is not necessarily due to the implementation of the plan.
  C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff becoming more meticulous after they became aware of the records being closely analyzed.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors in order to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors. 
  The incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. 
  The knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  
A: This statement doesn't strengthen the argument because it talks about a policy that was already in place before the implementation of the plan.
B: This statement doesn't strengthen the argument because it talks about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan.
C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that not all staff errors were recorded.
D: This statement strengthens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in the incidence of injuries was a direct result of the staff becoming more meticulous due to the knowledge that their errors were being monitored.
E: This statement doesn't strengthen the argument because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, but it doesn't provide any information about the effectiveness of the plan.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. The CEO assumes that because there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution, the corporation is doing all it can to pollute less. However, this assumption is flawed because it ignores the possibility that such methods could be developed in the future. Therefore, choice A is the correct answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The CEO is arguing that the company is environmentally responsible because they currently pollute less than they used to, and there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. 
A: This answer choice correctly identifies a flaw in the CEO's reasoning. The CEO assumes that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed, which is not necessarily true.
B: This answer choice is not relevant to the CEO's argument.
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the CEO's argument.
D: This answer choice is not relevant to the CEO's argument.

A: This answer choice correctly identifies that the CEO is taking for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. However, this is not the flaw in the CEO's reasoning.
B: This answer choice suggests that the CEO is failing to consider that different causes can have similar effects. However, this is not the flaw in the CEO's reasoning.
C: This answer choice correctly identifies that the CEO is generalizing too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. However, this is not the flaw in the CEO's reasoning.
D: This answer choice suggests that the CEO is taking for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded. However, this is not the flaw in the CEO's reasoning.
E: This answer choice correctly identifies that the CEO is ignoring the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now. This is the flaw in the CEO's reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods, and there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. 

A: The CEO's argument does not address the possibility of new methods that do not produce pollution, but it does not take for granted that such methods cannot be developed. 
B: The CEO's argument does not address different causes having similar effects. 
C: The CEO's argument does generalize from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. 
D: The CEO's argument does not take for granted that the company has succeeded in reducing the amount of pollution produced. 
E: The CEO's argument does not address the possibility of there being currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. The CEO assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, but this assumption is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument is flawed. Choice A correctly identifies this flaw. The other choices do not accurately describe the flaw in the CEO's argument.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The CEO argues that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did, and there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  A: The CEO does not discuss whether production methods that do not produce pollution can be developed or not.
  B: The CEO's argument does not involve different causes having similar effects.
  C: The CEO's argument does not generalize too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms.
  D: The CEO's argument does not take for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded.
  E: The CEO's argument acknowledges that there may be production methods that produce less pollution than the current methods, but states that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: 
The CEO's argument is flawed because it generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. The CEO argues that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did, and there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution. However, this argument does not address the possibility that there may be other ways in which the corporation is not environmentally responsible, such as excessive resource consumption or failure to properly dispose of waste. Therefore, the CEO's argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of one specific criticism means that the corporation is entirely environmentally responsible, which is an overgeneralization.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

The CEO's argument is flawed because it assumes that there are no current production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, and it is possible that there are other methods that could be implemented to reduce pollution even further. Therefore, the CEO's argument ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. The CEO assumes that because there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, the corporation is doing all it can to pollute less. However, it is possible that there are methods that have not yet been developed that could significantly reduce pollution. Therefore, the argument is flawed in assuming that the current methods are the best that can be done.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The CEO argues that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did, and there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  A: The CEO does not address the possibility of developing production methods that do not produce pollution, but this is not the main flaw in their argument.
  B: The CEO's argument does not involve different causes having similar effects, so this is not the main flaw in their argument.
  C: The CEO's argument may generalize too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms, but this is not the main flaw in their argument.
  D: The CEO's argument does not take for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded, so this is not the main flaw in their argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence to identify the polluter.
  A: This principle is directly relevant to the argument because it suggests that the severity of the penalty requires a higher standard of proof.
  B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument because it does not address the issue of identifying the polluter.
  C: This principle is indirectly relevant to the argument because it suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused, but it does not address the issue of identifying the polluter.
  D: This principle is indirectly relevant to the argument because it suggests that severe penalties may discourage people from admitting responsibility, but it does not address the issue of identifying the polluter.
  E: This principle is directly relevant to the argument because it suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be imposed without sufficient evidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a local auto repair shop for polluting a river due to lack of sufficient evidence. The penalty is severe, so the author is hesitant to impose it without stronger evidence or an admission of guilt. 
A: This principle supports the reasoning in the argument, as it suggests that a severe penalty requires a higher level of certainty of guilt. 
B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument. 
C: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument. 
D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument. 
E: This principle is similar to the reasoning in the argument, as it suggests that a penalty should not be so severe that it cannot be justified by certainty of guilt. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty for pollution due to lack of certainty about the identity of the polluter.
  A: This principle is directly related to the argument and supports it.
  B: This principle is not directly related to the argument.
  C: This principle is related to the severity of the penalty, but it does not address the issue of certainty about the identity of the polluter.
  D: This principle is not directly related to the argument.
  E: This principle is directly related to the argument and contradicts it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty. 
A: This principle supports the argument's reasoning by stating that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
B: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
D: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
E: This principle supports the argument's reasoning by stating that the severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the justification for imposing a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe, and therefore, stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is required to justify imposing the penalty.
A: This principle supports the argument's reasoning by stating that a more severe penalty requires a higher level of certainty of guilt before imposing the penalty.
B: This principle is not directly related to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty and the certainty of guilt required to impose it.
C: This principle is not directly related to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty and the certainty of guilt required to impose it.
D: This principle is not directly related to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty and the certainty of guilt required to impose it.
E: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning by stating that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a penalty for pollution without sufficient evidence to identify the polluter.
  A: This principle is relevant to the argument, as it suggests that the severity of the penalty requires a higher burden of proof to justify imposing it.
  B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument, as it discusses the appropriate level of penalties, not the burden of proof required to impose them.
  C: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument, as it discusses the relationship between harm caused and penalty severity, not the burden of proof required to impose a penalty.
  D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument, as it discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, not the burden of proof required to impose a penalty.
  E: This principle is directly relevant to the argument, as it suggests that the severity of the penalty must be limited by the ability to establish guilt.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument is discussing the difficulty of justifying imposing a severe penalty on the auto repair shop without stronger evidence or admission of responsibility.
A: This principle is directly related to the argument and supports the reasoning that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is necessary before imposing a severe penalty.
B: This principle discusses the appropriate severity of penalties, but it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt or the justification for imposing a penalty.
C: This principle discusses the proportionality of penalties to harm caused, but it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt or the justification for imposing a penalty.
D: This principle suggests that severe penalties may discourage someone from admitting responsibility, but it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt or the justification for imposing a penalty.
E: This principle is directly related to the argument and supports the reasoning that a penalty should not be imposed if there is not sufficient certainty of guilt to justify it.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
The argument states that the penalty for pollution is severe and that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is necessary to justify imposing the penalty.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for the pollution in the river and the severity of the penalty for this type of pollution.
  A: This principle is relevant to the argument because it suggests that the severity of the penalty requires a higher level of certainty about the guilt of the party responsible. 
  B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument.
  C: This principle is relevant to the argument because it suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction.
  D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The Florida panther population has increased from the 1970s but is still not self-sustaining at its current population of 70-100.
  The current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  
Answer: "C" Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The Florida panther population has increased from the 1970s, but it is still below the minimum required for self-sustainability.
  - The current habitat of the Florida panthers is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  
A: The fact that the current habitat is not large enough does not necessarily mean that some part of it is only of marginal quality. It could be that the habitat is of good quality, but simply not large enough.
B: The statement does not support this conclusion. It only states that the population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
C: This statement is supported by the fact that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
D: This statement is not supported by the information given. The population has increased significantly since the 1970s.
E: The statement does not provide any information about the size of the current habitat compared to the habitat in the 1970s.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The Florida panther is an endangered species.
  - The current population of Florida panthers is between 70 to 100.
  - The population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining.
  - The current habitat is not large enough to support more of these animals.
  
A: The fact that the current habitat is not large enough to support more panthers does not necessarily mean that some part of the habitat is only of marginal quality. It could be that the habitat is of good quality but simply not large enough to support more animals.
B: This statement contradicts the information given in the passage. The passage states that the population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining, which implies that a population greater than 250 would also be self-sustaining. 
C: This statement is consistent with the information given in the passage. The passage states that the current habitat is not large enough to support more panthers, and that the population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining. Therefore, unless the panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
D: The passage does not provide any evidence to support this statement. In fact, the passage states that the current population represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, which suggests that the population could continue to increase.
E: The passage does not provide any evidence to support this statement. In fact, the passage implies that the current habitat is not large enough to support more panthers, which suggests that the habitat may be smaller than it was in the 1970s.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The Florida panther population is currently between 70 to 100 individuals.
  The population needs to reach at least 250 individuals to be self-sustaining.

A: The fact that the current habitat is not large enough to support more panthers does not necessarily mean that some part of the habitat is only of marginal quality. 
B: The statement is not necessarily true since there could be other factors that prevent the population from being self-sustaining.
C: This statement is true based on the information given.
D: The statement is not necessarily true since the population could continue to increase if they acquire a larger habitat.
E: There is no information given in the text to support this statement.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The Florida panther population has increased from a very low number in the 1970s to 70 to 100 individuals today.
  - For the population to be self-sustaining, it needs to reach at least 250 individuals.
  - The current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  
Analysis:
  - Option A may be true, but it is not a necessary conclusion from the given statements.
  - Option B is not true. The statement says that the population needs to reach 250 to be self-sustaining, but it does not say that exceeding 250 would be self-sustaining.
  - Option C is true. The statement says that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, and that the population needs to reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining. Therefore, unless the habitat is expanded, the population will not be self-sustaining.
  - Option D is not true. The statement says that the population has increased from a very low number in the 1970s to 70 to 100 individuals today, but it does not say that it will never increase beyond its current level.
  - Option E is not true. The statement does not provide any information on whether the habitat has increased or decreased since the 1970s.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The Florida panther is an endangered species.
  The current population of Florida panthers is between 70 to 100.
  The population of Florida panthers must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  The current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  
A: The passage states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, but it does not indicate that any part of the habitat is of marginal quality.
  B: The passage states that the population of Florida panthers must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining, but it does not indicate that exceeding 250 will make it self-sustaining.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The argument concludes that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the fact that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) was far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than Group B (composed of college students). The argument is trying to establish a causal relationship between age and memory.

A: This statement is helpful because it establishes that both groups were of the same size, which is important for ensuring that the two groups were comparable and that any differences in memory performance were not due to differences in group size.
B: This statement is helpful because it establishes that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which is important for ensuring that any differences in memory performance were not due to differences in the way the calls were answered.
C: This statement is helpful because it establishes that there were no persons more than forty years old among the college students, which is important for ensuring that any differences in memory performance were not due to differences in the age range of the participants in the two groups.
D: This statement is helpful because it establishes that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which is important for ensuring that any differences in memory performance were not due to differences in access to telephones.
E: This statement is helpful because it establishes that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which is important for ensuring that any differences in memory performance were not due to differences in the amount of time the participants had to prepare for the task.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The study found that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) was better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than Group B (composed of college students). There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. 
A: This fact is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it indicates that the two groups were of equal size, which is important for making valid comparisons between them.
B: This fact is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it indicates that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which helps to control for potential confounding variables.
C: This fact is not directly related to the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages. 
D: This fact is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it indicates that both groups had equal access to the resources necessary to make the required calls.
E: This fact is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it indicates that the members of the two groups had approximately the same amount of time to prepare for making their telephone calls.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The study compared the ability of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), to make a telephone call at a specified time. Group A performed better than Group B, with only one lapse compared to fourteen lapses.
A: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn, as it indicates that the two groups were of equal size and therefore the comparison is valid.
B: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn, as it indicates that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, ensuring consistency in the measurement of the results.
C: This statement is not helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn, as it does not relate to the ability of the two groups to make a telephone call at a specified time.
D: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn, as it indicates that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, ensuring that any differences in performance were not due to differences in access to resources.
E: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn, as it indicates that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, ensuring that any differences in performance were not due to differences in preparation time.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The study compared the ability of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), to remember to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time. 
  Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. 
  There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A.
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  
A: The number of people in each group is not relevant to the conclusion.
B: The researchers answering the calls is not relevant to the conclusion.
C: The age of the college students is not relevant to the conclusion.
D: The access to telephones is relevant to the conclusion because it could have affected the ability of the groups to make the calls on time.
E: The timing of the instructions is relevant to the conclusion because it could have affected the ability of the groups to make the calls on time.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument concludes that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the evidence that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) performed far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B (composed of college students). The question asks us to identify the least helpful statement in establishing the conclusion.
 
A: This statement is helpful because it tells us that the two groups are of the same size, which means that the difference in performance is not due to the size of the groups.
B: This statement is helpful because it tells us that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which means that the difference in performance is not due to differences in how the calls were answered.
C: This statement is helpful because it tells us that there were no persons more than forty years old among the college students, which means that the difference in performance is not due to the presence of older individuals in Group A.
D: This statement is helpful because it tells us that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which means that the difference in performance is not due to differences in access to telephones.
E: This statement is the least helpful because it tells us that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls. However, this does not have a direct bearing on the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), in terms of their ability to remember to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time. Group A performed better than Group B with only one lapse compared to fourteen lapses in Group B. The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  
A: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups are of the same size and, therefore, the study is fair.
B: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which eliminates a potential source of bias.
C: This statement is not helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it does not address the issue of memory performance in different age groups.
D: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups had the same resources to make the required calls, which eliminates a potential source of bias.
E: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which eliminates a potential source of bias.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The study compared two groups of people: Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students).
  Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
  There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A.
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  The number of people in each group is not relevant to the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages. Therefore, if all of the choices are true, A would be the least helpful in establishing the conclusion.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The study compared the ability of two groups, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), to make a telephone call at a specified time.
  Group A had only one lapse while Group B had fourteen lapses.
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  A: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it ensures that there was an equal number of people in each group, which eliminates the possibility that the difference in results was due to a difference in sample size.
  B: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it ensures that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which eliminates the possibility that the difference in results was due to a difference in the researchers' ability to record the data.
  C: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it ensures that the college students were not older than the age range of Group A, which eliminates the possibility that the difference in results was due to age differences between the two groups.
  D: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups had the same resources available to them, which eliminates the possibility that the difference in results was due to a difference in access to telephones.
  E: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups had the same amount of time to prepare for the task, which eliminates the possibility that the difference in results was due to a difference in preparation time.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared the ability of Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students) to make a telephone call at a specified time. 
  Group A performed better than Group B, with only one lapse in Group A and fourteen lapses in Group B.
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  
A: This statement is helpful because it tells us that the number of people in each group is the same, which means that the comparison between the two groups is fair.
B: This statement is helpful because it tells us that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups. This means that any differences in the responses of the researchers would not affect the comparison between the two groups.
C: This statement is not helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it does not provide any information about the memory of the college students or the older adults. It is irrelevant to the conclusion.
D: This statement is helpful because it tells us that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls. This means that any differences in access to telephones would not affect the comparison between the two groups.
E: This statement is helpful because it tells us that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls. This means that any differences in the amount of time the two groups had to prepare for the task would not affect the comparison between the two groups.

Action: Answer("C")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist's argument is that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct because a large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  A: Inferring from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect is a fallacy known as post hoc ergo propter hoc. There is no indication that the pharmacist is making this fallacy.

B: This choice is not applicable to the argument.
C: This choice is not applicable to the argument.
D: The argument concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct, but the study only showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia's symptoms. Therefore, the argument confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
E: The argument does not provide information about the representativeness of the sample used in the study.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct, based on a large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia that showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the pharmacist.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased.
  C: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the pharmacist.
  D: This choice is relevant to the argument made by the pharmacist, as the argument confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause. The study shows that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia's symptoms, but it does not prove that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  E: The argument does not rely on an unrepresentative sample.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist argues that a large study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms.
  The pharmacist concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct.
  The claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock.
  
Analysis:
  The pharmacist's argument is that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because a large study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms. However, the conclusion that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages does not necessarily follow from this argument. The study may have shown that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms, but it does not necessarily support the claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages. Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a large study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81.

  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of biased individuals.
  C: The argument does not use two different meanings for the same term.
  D: This choice is the best answer. The argument confuses the effect of melatonin ingestion with the cause of insomnia.
  E: The argument does not provide evidence that the sample is unrepresentative.
Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain, based on an experiment with 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the condition of the patients in the first group could be due to a placebo effect.
  B: This statement is an opinion, and it does not provide evidence against the physician's argument.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing back pain.
  D: This statement suggests that the experiment may have been biased, but it does not provide evidence against the physician's argument.
  E: This statement suggests that the variation in the specific causes of the back pain may have affected the results of the experiment, and it provides evidence against the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. 
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  
Analysis:
  Since some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions, the number of paychecks per pay period would not necessarily correspond to the number of people employed. Thus, the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used may be inaccurate.
  
Action: Answer("D")

  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  Since some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions, the number of paychecks per pay period would be greater than the number of employees. Therefore, the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed would be overestimated.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country in 1988.
  The new program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis: 
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X to determine the number of people employed in the country simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used may not be accurate.

  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The government used a new computer program to estimate the number of people employed in Country X. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. So, the correct answer is D.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. 
  The program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. 
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The new program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. Therefore, if some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions, the new program would overestimate the number of people employed in X. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis: 
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the total number of paychecks would not be an accurate estimate of the number of people employed. 

Action: Answer("D") 
  The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X to determine the number of people employed in that country tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The fact that some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions, means that the new program would count each of these paychecks as a separate job, leading to an overestimate of the number of people employed in X. Therefore, we can conclude that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The new program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. This means that the number of paychecks tallied by the program would have been higher than the actual number of people employed. Therefore, we can conclude that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% of all hair dryer sales nationwide over the last 5 years.
  The argument further states that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It states that the hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% of all hair dryer sales nationwide over the last 5 years.
B: The argument provides specific information about the average net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold. Therefore, this choice is not correct.
C: The argument only discusses the sales figures for Wilson Appliance's hair dryers and does not mention any other products. Therefore, this choice is not correct.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which could have kept the net income constant or even increased it. Therefore, this choice is the correct answer.
E: The argument does not provide any information about whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. Therefore, this choice is not correct.
Action: Answer("D")

The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. The argument clearly states that the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has declined from 50 percent to 25 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. The argument is concerned with the net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers. The argument is concerned with the sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years. If the retail price of the hair dryer has increased, then the net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold may not have remained constant over the last 5 years. Therefore, the argument's conclusion that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago may not be valid.
E: The argument does not need to provide independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. The argument is concerned with the net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold.

  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide.
  The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: This is a correct assessment of the argument's flaw. The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is due to a decline in total sales of the product, which may not be the case. Other companies may have entered the market, increasing competition and reducing Wilson's market share.
B: The argument does not need to provide information about the profits hair dryers generate for other companies. It only needs to focus on Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of their hair dryer.
C: The argument only focuses on Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales and does not need to discuss sales figures for other products.
D: The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed, so an increase in retail price is not relevant to the conclusion.
E: The argument does not provide any evidence about whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago, but currently, it only accounts for 25 percent of such sales. The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, and concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. The argument clearly states that the hair dryer's market share has declined from 50% to 25% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. The argument is concerned with the net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold, which has not changed over the last 5 years.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers. The argument is focused on the hair dryer product and its decline in market share.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years. If the retail price of the hair dryer increased, then the net income per hair dryer sold could have remained the same or even increased, despite the decline in market share.
E: The argument provides no information about whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. The argument only discusses the decline in market share and net income from sales of the hair dryer product.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% of all hair dryer sales nationwide over the past 5 years.
  The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The conclusion of the argument is that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: This is the correct answer. The argument assumes that the decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is due to a decline in the total sales of that product. However, it is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased over the past 5 years, and that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales have simply declined relative to the sales of other hair dryer brands. Therefore, the argument's reasoning is flawed.
  B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them in order to be valid.
  C: The argument only focuses on the sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers, so it is not necessary to discuss sales figures for the company's other products.
  D: The argument assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, so it is not relevant whether the retail price of the hair dryer has increased.
  E: The argument does not provide any evidence about the profitability of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer compared to its other products, so it is not relevant whether the hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago, but now it only accounts for 25 percent of such sales. The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
A: This is a correct choice because it points out that the argument confuses a decline in market share with a decline in total sales. The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the last 5 years, which may not be true. 
B: The argument is not concerned with the profits generated by other companies that produce hair dryers, so this choice is not relevant.
C: The argument is only concerned with the sales figures of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers, so this choice is not relevant.
D: This is not a correct choice because the argument states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
E: This is not a correct choice because the argument does not provide any evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.

Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

  D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist assumes that the absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity is evidence against this claim.
  E: This choice presents an alternative possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not a flaw in the argument itself.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, despite the purchase of the latest safety technology. The argument is based on studies conducted 30 years ago.
A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it does not accurately reflect the argument's reasoning or evidence.
B: This choice suggests an alternative possibility, but it does not address the argument's reasoning or evidence.
C: This choice suggests that the city council members are aware of the studies, but it does not address the argument's reasoning or evidence.
D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The editorialist's argument confuses a lack of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
E: This choice suggests an alternative possibility, but it does not address the argument's reasoning or evidence.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, despite the purchase of the latest safety technology. The editorialist supports this argument by citing numerous studies conducted 30 years ago that show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances (i.e. numerous studies conducted 30 years ago). However, this flaw is not the most accurate description of the argument's flaw.
B: This choice describes a possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does not address the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
C: This choice does not describe a flaw in the argument. The argument does not address whether the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
D: This choice most accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim. The argument assumes that the studies conducted 30 years ago are still valid and applicable to the current situation, without providing any evidence to support this assumption.
E: This choice describes a possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does not address whether a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, despite the purchase of the latest safety technology.

  B: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  C: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist assumes that the studies conducted 30 years ago are still relevant today, without considering the possibility that the latest safety technology may have improved since then. The editorialist also assumes that the council members are unaware of the studies, without any evidence to support this claim.
  E: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, based on studies conducted 30 years ago, even with the latest safety technology.
A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it does not accurately describe the flaw. The argument does not draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement inferred from a limited number of particular instances.
B: This choice describes a possible flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the latest technology may affect safety.
C: This choice is incorrect. The argument acknowledges that the council members support the increase, but it does not consider whether they are aware of the studies.
D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The editorialist argues that safety would be reduced, based on studies conducted 30 years ago, but does not provide evidence that the latest safety technology would not mitigate the risks.
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument, which focuses on safety risks.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, citing studies conducted 30 years ago which show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology. 
A: This choice describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has been inferred from a limited number of particular instances.
B: This choice is not accurate. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is. In fact, the argument claims that the latest safety technology would not prevent a decrease in safety.
C: This choice is not accurate. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago. The argument simply disagrees with the council members' conclusion that the latest safety technology would prevent a decrease in safety.
D: This choice describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument and is the most accurate choice. The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim. The studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, but the argument does not provide evidence that the latest safety technology would not prevent a decrease in safety.
E: This choice is not accurate. The argument does not consider the possibility that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:

C: This answer choice is relevant to the argument, but it does not criticize the argument itself. It is not a vulnerability of the argument.
  
D: This answer choice is a potential criticism of the argument. The argument assumes that the presence of bicycle lanes on roads is not a factor in the number of accidents that occur on those roads. However, this assumption may not be true if the bicycle lanes are poorly designed or implemented. If the bicycle lanes are not safe, then the presence of bicycle lanes on roads could actually increase the number of accidents that occur on those roads. Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it assumes that all bicycle lanes are safe and effective.
  
E: This answer choice is not a vulnerability of the argument. The argument is based on statistics, and this answer choice does not criticize the use of statistics as evidence.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:

Context: Over the last few decades, public outcries against pollution have brought about stricter regulations of emissions. The cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. This would not have happened without these stricter regulations.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the statements above?
Choices:
  A: In the city with the worst air pollution today, the air quality is better than it was 30 years ago.
  B: No city has worse air pollution today than it did 30 years ago.
  C: Most of the public outcries against pollution came from people in the cities that had the most polluted air.
  D: The most polluted cities today are not the cities that were the most polluted 30 years ago.

Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
The passage states that stricter regulations of emissions have brought about improved air quality in cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. It also states that this improvement would not have happened without these stricter regulations. From this, we can infer that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Therefore, the correct answer is E. 

A cannot be inferred because the passage only mentions that the air quality has improved, not that it is better than any other city.
B cannot be inferred because the passage does not provide information about the air quality of all cities.
C cannot be inferred because the passage only mentions public outcries against pollution, not where they came from.
D cannot be inferred because the passage does not provide information about the air quality of all cities.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only source of distraction in the workplace, and that other sources of distraction, such as windows or decorations, are not treated the same way.
A: The argument is about moderation and how it does not take into account people's biological differences.
B: The argument is about banning a device based on research that shows it causes cancer in laboratory animals.
C: The argument is about the number of employees a company needs to hire.
D: The argument is about engaging characters in creative writing classes not guaranteeing a sale.
E: The argument is about the movie industry's criterion for success being misguided.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not necessarily helpful in increasing productivity, since other factors can be distracting as well.
A: The argument is about how different people react differently to certain substances, so it is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
B: The argument is about how most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason, so it is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
C: The argument is about how Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because it expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year, so it is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
D: The argument is about how engaging characters do not guarantee a sale, so it is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
E: The argument is about how judging a film's success in terms of its profit relative to its cost is misguided, since an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, so it is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.

Response 2:
Knowledge: The employee argues that the company's reasoning for blocking non-work-related websites is flawed because other distractions, such as an undecorated, windowless room, can also affect productivity.
A: This argument is about individual differences in reaction to substances and how it affects the idea of moderation. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
B: This argument is about banning a device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals, but most chemicals cause cancer in high doses. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
C: This argument is about the need for Acme to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 of its employees are expected to retire. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
D: This argument is about the relationship between engaging characters and the sale of novels and stories. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The employee argues that the company's reasoning for blocking non-work-related websites is flawed since other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not blocked. 
A: This argument is about moderation and how it fails to take into account people's basic biological differences. It does not share the same reasoning as the employee's argument.
B: This argument is about banning an electronic device due to its potential to cause cancer in laboratory animals. It does not share the same reasoning as the employee's argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that just because H pylori is present in many people without causing stomach ulcers, it does not mean it should be considered a commensal. The comparison is made with M tuberculosis which is also present in many people without causing tuberculosis, but it is not considered a commensal.
  A: This statement does not affect the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement does not affect the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning.
  D: This statement does not affect the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement weakens the argument's reasoning because it shows that the number of people who harbor H pylori is larger than the number of people who harbor M tuberculosis, which could explain why H pylori is more likely to be considered a commensal.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite its alleged immune-strengthening properties because it can cause stomach ulcers. The counterexample is M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis but is not considered a commensal despite the fact that only about 10% of people who harbor it get sick.
  A: This statement does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning by suggesting that M tuberculosis is not a commensal because people who harbor it derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: This statement does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the prevalence of a bacterium is a relevant factor in determining whether it is a commensal.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response. The counterexample given is M tuberculosis, which does not benefit the host and can cause tuberculosis in some people even though most people who harbor it do not get sick.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning by showing that M tuberculosis is not a commensal.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement weakens the argument's reasoning because it suggests that H pylori is more likely to be a commensal than M tuberculosis simply because more people harbor it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about whether Helicobacter pylori can be considered a commensal bacterium despite its role in causing stomach ulcers.
  The argument compares H pylori to Mycobacter tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis.

A: This statement does not directly address the argument's reasoning. 
B: This statement does not directly address the argument's reasoning. 
C: This statement weakens the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the presence of a bacterium that causes illness does not necessarily mean that it cannot also provide benefits to the host. 
D: This statement does not directly address the argument's reasoning. 
E: This statement does not directly address the argument's reasoning. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:

  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning by suggesting that M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because it does not provide any benefit to the people who harbor it.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the fact that more people harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis could be a reason to consider H pylori a commensal, even if it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens immune response and only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of those who harbor it.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer and low-fiber diets cause colon cancer. It provides evidence from studies that show a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rates. However, the argument may overlook other factors that could affect colon cancer rates.
A: The argument is not concerned with changes in fther consumption over time, so this is not a relevant criticism.
B: This statement, if true, would support the argument's conclusion that high-fiber diets prevent cancer, rather than undermine it. Therefore, it is not a relevant criticism.
C: This statement, if true, would not necessarily undermine the argument's conclusion that low-fiber diets cause colon cancer. Therefore, it is not a relevant criticism.
D: This statement, if true, would not necessarily undermine the argument's conclusion that low-fiber diets cause colon cancer. Therefore, it is not a relevant criticism.
E: This statement presents an alternative explanation for the correlation between high-fiber diets and lower colon cancer rates. If other substances in fiber-rich foods are responsible for the correlation, then the argument's conclusion that fther alone causes colon cancer may be incorrect. Therefore, this is the most relevant criticism of the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument claims that a negative correlation exists between high-fiber diets and colon cancer. It supports this claim by citing studies that show a lower incidence of colon cancer in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, and by citing a study in Scandinavia that shows a correlation between low consumption of cereals (which are high in fiber) and high colon cancer rates. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument, as it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
C: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument, as it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
D: This statement is somewhat relevant to the argument, as it raises the possibility that different types of fiber may have different effects on colon cancer. However, the argument does not rely on the assumption that all types of fiber have the same effect on colon cancer, so this statement does not significantly weaken the argument.
E: This statement is the most relevant to the argument, as it raises the possibility that other substances in fiber-rich foods may be responsible for the observed correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer. If this is the case, then the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it, would be called into question.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer and low-fiber diets cause it.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  C: This statement does not weaken the argument's reasoning because it does not contradict the claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  E: This statement is a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning because it suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods may be responsible for the observed correlation between high-fiber diets and lower colon cancer rates.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer, and that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer while sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether or not the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising does not affect the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer while sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  B: This choice is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Whether or not the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fiber diets does not affect the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer while sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  C: This choice is not a valid criticism of the argument's reasoning. The argument does not claim that everyone can or should consume fiber, but rather that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer while sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
D: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning. If the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees, then the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer while sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it may not be valid.
E: This choice is also a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning. If foods containing fiber also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer, then the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer while sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it may not be valid.

Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It also claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning as it talks about the consumption of fiber in many countries, but the argument is about the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning as the argument is only concerned with the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning as it talks about the difficulty of including fiber in people's diets, but it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
D: This statement is relevant to the argument's reasoning as it suggests that the type of fiber in fruits and vegetables and the type of fiber in cereals may have different effects on colon cancer. 
E: This statement is relevant to the argument's reasoning as it suggests that other substances in foods containing fiber may also be preventing colon cancer. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. It cites studies that demonstrate a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. The argument also cites the example of Western countries where the colon cancer rate is higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia, the argument cites that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  
A: The argument is not concerned with whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably or not. This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
B: The argument does not discuss the risk of many types of cancer being reduced by high-fiber diets. This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
C: The argument does not discuss whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets. This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not discuss whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees. This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
E: This statement presents an alternative explanation for the negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. If foods containing fiber also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer, then the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it may be too simplistic. Therefore, this statement is a possible criticism of the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence. It further claims that in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, the incidence of colon cancer is lower. Additionally, in Scandinavia, it has been shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably or not. It is irrelevant to the argument.
B: The argument does not address the risk of many types of cancer being reduced by high-fiber diets. It is irrelevant to the argument.
C: The argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets or not. It is irrelevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not address whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees or not. It is irrelevant to the argument.
E: This choice presents a possible criticism of the argument. The argument assumes that it is the fiber in foods that is responsible for the observed correlation between high-fiber diets and low colon cancer incidence. However, it is possible that other substances in foods containing fiber are responsible for the observed correlation. Therefore, this choice is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.

  The argument states that halogen lamps from most major manufacturers are on display at Furniture Labyrinth and any item on display at Furniture Labyrinth is well crafted.

A: The argument states that there is a chance of storms most days this week and whenever there are storms, the temperature drops suddenly. The two parts of the argument are not related to each other, so it is not similar in reasoning to the original argument.

B: The argument states that Melinda has written several different kinds of sonnets and everything Melinda writes is disturbing. The two parts of the argument are not related to each other, so it is not similar in reasoning to the original argument.

C: The argument states that Gianna can have her car worked on at any of several shops in the city, and every shop is capable of doing good mechanical work. This is similar in reasoning to the original argument, as it establishes a relationship between the availability of a service and the quality of the service.

D: The argument states that many different species of minnow can be found in lakes nearby, and every lake nearby is teeming with healthy fish. The two parts of the argument are not related to each other, so it is not similar in reasoning to the original argument.

E: The argument states that cornmeal is among the ingredients used in preparing meals at Matteo's Trattoria, and whenever a meal is prepared at Matteo's Trattoria, only healthful, organic ingredients are used. This is similar in reasoning to the original argument, as it establishes a relationship between the presence of an ingredient and the quality of the food.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well

  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
  
Analysis:
  The argument seems to be based on a correct premise that any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is dominant in that market. However, the argument mistakes a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result. The survey results show that 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market, but it does not necessarily mean that Harrold Foods dominates the market. The argument assumes that maintaining the current market share is sufficient to continue dominating the market, but it does not consider the possibility of new competitors entering the market or consumers switching to other products.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that Harrold Foods dominates the market and only needs to maintain its current market share to continue to do so.

A: This answer choice is not applicable to the argument.
B: This answer choice is not applicable to the argument.
C: This answer choice is not applicable to the argument.
D: This answer choice is not applicable to the argument.
E: This answer choice is the best answer. The argument describes survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.

  The argument is based on the premise that any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market.
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so, based on the survey results that show that 72 percent of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  
Analysis:
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result. The fact that more than 50% of the sales in a market is a condition required for a product to be dominant in that market, but it is not sufficient to guarantee that a product is dominant in that market. The argument assumes that because 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market, then it must be true that "Hero" dominates the market, without providing any additional evidence to support this claim.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Response 0:

- Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
The science journalist's statements indicate that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. This is supported by the fact that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so their lithium cannot be consumed. None of the other statements are supported by the journalist's statements.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.

  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("B")  
The science journalist states that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. This is because stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Brown dwarfs, on the other hand, do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so their lithium cannot be consumed. Therefore, option B is the most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements.
Response 2:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:

Topic: Law
Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.

Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument above states that if a party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have decreased, but since the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
A: The argument presents a conditional statement that if something had happened, then something else would have happened, but since the second thing did not happen, the first thing must not have happened either. 
B: The argument presents a conditional statement that if something happens, then something else will happen, but since the second thing did not happen, the first thing must not happen either.
C: The argument presents a conditional statement that if something had happened, then something else would have happened, but since the second thing did not happen, the first thing must not have happened either.
D: The argument presents a conditional statement that if something had happened, then something else would have happened, and since the second thing did happen, the first thing must have happened too.
E: The argument presents a conditional statement that if something had happened, then something else would have happened, but since the second thing did not happen, the first thing must not have happened either.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably, but the opposite occurred. Therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  A: The argument states that if the valley people had been invaded or there had been a climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture. But since the architecture remained the same, the valley people must not have been invaded. This argument is flawed because it assumes that changes in architecture can only occur if there is an invasion or climatic change.
  B: The argument states that many people fear that if the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But since the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the workers' promise not to strike is based on their belief that the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: The argument states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only way for the stock price to double is if the company sells its subsidiaries and purchases a new patent.
  D: The argument states that city residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels if the battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason for the residents' support is if the rebels won the battle.
  E: The argument states that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason for the decrease in ratings is the new weather forecasting equipment.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument above assumes that the party's economic theories were sound, but they were not. It also assumes that the implementation of the program would have led to a decrease in the inflation rate, but it actually increased. 
A: This argument involves an assumption about the reason for the architecture remaining the same. It assumes that the valley people were never invaded, but there may be other reasons why the architecture remained the same.
B: This argument involves an assumption about the workers' thinking. It assumes that they believe the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut, but there may be other reasons why they promised not to strike.
C: This argument involves an assumption about the reason for the stock price not increasing. It assumes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries, but there may be other reasons why the stock price did not increase.
D: This argument involves an assumption about the outcome of the battle. It assumes that the rebels won the battle because the residents showed support, but there may be other reasons why the residents showed support.
E: This argument involves an assumption about the effectiveness of the new weather forecasting equipment. It assumes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old because the station's ratings decreased, but there may be other reasons why the ratings decreased.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument above assumes that the party's economic theories were sound, but the inflation rate increased, which means that the theories were wrong.
A: The argument assumes that the architecture would have changed if the valley people were invaded or if there were climatic changes, but since the architecture remained the same, the valley people were not invaded. This is a flawed assumption.
B: The argument assumes that because workers promised not to strike, they think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This is a flawed assumption.
C: The argument assumes that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. This is a flawed assumption.
D: The argument assumes that the city residents showed a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days, so the rebels must have won the battle. This is a flawed assumption.
E: The argument assumes that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. This is a flawed assumption.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument above makes a conditional statement that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, the inflation rate increased, so the argument concludes that the party's economic theories were far off the mark. 

A: This argument presents a conditional statement that if the people who inhabited the valley were invaded or if there was a dramatic climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture. However, since the architecture remained the same throughout their stay, the argument concludes that the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay. This argument does not have the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.

B: This argument presents a conditional statement that if the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. However, the workers have promised not to strike, so the argument concludes that these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This argument does not have the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.

C: This argument presents a conditional statement that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. However, the price of the stock did not increase in that time, so the argument concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This argument has the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.

D: This argument presents a conditional statement that city residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels if the battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days, so the argument concludes that the rebels must have won the battle. This argument does not have the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.

E: This argument presents a conditional statement that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. However, the station's ratings actually decreased, so the argument concludes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This argument has the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.

Since cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable, it is logical to conclude that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries. Therefore, the statement that most logically completes the government official's argument is "foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries."
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The government official argues that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  A: This choice is not related to the argument made by the government official.
  B: This choice is not supported by the argument made by the government official. The official only argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries, not cabinet undersecretaries.
  C: This choice is not supported by the argument made by the government official. The official does not mention that only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  D: This choice contradicts the argument made by the government official that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.
  E: This choice contradicts the argument made by the government official that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed because those who would be adversely affected by it are very influential, which suggests that the democracy is not functioning well. Option B provides a principle that supports the columnist's reasoning by stating that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle implies that the fact that the bill is not passing despite its popularity among most people is a sign of a malfunctioning democracy. The other options do not provide principles that directly support the columnist's reasoning.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist argues that the fact that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights is not passed into law because of the opposition of influential people shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. Choice B most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning because it states that if a democracy is well-functioning, any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This implies that the fact that the bill is not passed into law despite being favored by most people suggests that the democracy is not well-functioning.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The columnist argues that the fact that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights is not passed into law due to the opposition of influential people, shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. The principle that best justifies the columnist's reasoning is that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle supports the idea that a well-functioning democracy should prioritize the interests of the majority, even if they are opposed by a minority with more power and influence.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed because those who would be adversely affected by it are very influential, which suggests that the democracy is not functioning well. The principle that best justifies this reasoning is B, which states that if a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle supports the columnist's argument that the bill will not be passed because influential people are opposing it, despite the fact that most people favor it.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

The columnist argues that the fact that a bill that would benefit most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights is not passed because of the opposition of influential people shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. Choice B supports this reasoning by stating that in a well-functioning democracy, any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. Therefore, the columnist's reasoning is most justified by choice B.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed because those who would be adversely affected by it are very influential, which suggests that the democracy is not functioning well. Choice B most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning by stating that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle supports the columnist's argument that the bill will not be passed because of the influence of those who oppose it, despite the fact that most people favor it.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed into law because those who would be adversely affected are influential, which suggests that the democracy is not functioning well. Choice B most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning by stating that if a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle supports the columnist's argument that the bill is not passing into law because the democracy is not functioning well.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the fact that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law because of the opposition of influential people shows that the democracy is not well-functioning. Option B most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning by stating that in a well-functioning democracy, any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle is consistent with the columnist's argument that the bill will not be passed for many years, if at all, because of the opposition of influential people.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist argues that the fact that the bill, which most people favor and does not violate anyone's basic human rights, will not be passed for many years, if at all, shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. Choice B supports this reasoning by stating that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle aligns with the columnist's argument that the bill is not being passed because those who would be adversely affected by it are very influential.

C: The argument criticizes the source of a claim (the economic advisor) rather than examining the claim itself (the suggestion to reduce taxes without significantly decreasing government services).
D: The argument does not take lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim.
E: The argument presupposes what it sets out to establish, namely that the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services because the economic advisor's advice is untrustworthy.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The author is trying to argue that the premier should not listen to the economic advisor's advice on reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services. The author supports this conclusion by pointing out that the advisor was convicted of embezzlement in his youth and therefore his economic advice is untrustworthy.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, and that it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries rather than an accountant, because an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  
A: This weakens the detective's argument because if the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized by supervisors, then it is less likely that one of them would have been able to embezzle without being detected. Therefore, this choice does not belong to the answer.
B: This weakens the detective's argument because if there were breaches in computer security, then it is possible that someone outside XYZ Corporation could have accessed the internal financial records and committed the embezzlement. Therefore, this choice weakens the detective's argument.
C: This does not weaken the detective's argument because the argument is not based on the number of accountants or actuaries employed by XYZ Corporation.
D: This weakens the detective's argument because if an independent report had already concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, then it is possible that the embezzler was not an employee of XYZ Corporation and that the crime was committed by an outsider. Therefore, this choice weakens the detective's argument.
E: This does not weaken the detective's argument because the argument is not based on the difficulty of access to internal financial records.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The detective's argument is based on the assumption that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary, and that an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Therefore, the detective concludes that it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized than those of the accountants, it would weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries.
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to internal financial records, it would weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records.
  C: If there were more accountants than actuaries, it would weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries.
  D: If an independent report had already concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, it would weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records.
  E: If certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, it would weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: Weakens the argument because it suggests that the accountants could have made mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  B: Weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside of XYZ Corporation could have had access to internal financial records.
  C: Weakens the argument because it suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, making it more likely that the embezzler is an accountant.
  D: Does not weaken the argument because it is unrelated to the detective's reasoning.
  E: Weakens the argument because it suggests that the actuaries may not have had access to internal financial records.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: This choice suggests that the actuaries were more closely scrutinized than the accountants, which would strengthen the argument that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries. Therefore, this weakens the detective's argument.
  B: This choice suggests that someone outside of XYZ Corporation could have had access to the internal financial records, which weakens the argument that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries.
  C: This choice suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, which weakens the argument that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries.
  D: This choice suggests that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement even before the crime took place, which weakens the argument that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries.
  E: This choice suggests that it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, which would strengthen the argument that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries. Therefore, this weakens the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely an actuary because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that the accountants might have made mistakes that went unnoticed by supervisors.
  B: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that someone outside of XYZ Corporation could have gained access to the internal financial records.
  C: This does not weaken the detective's argument.
  D: This does not weaken the detective's argument.
  E: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that the actuaries might not have had access to the internal financial records.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because accountants would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. 
  A: If the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized than the accountants', it would make it less likely that an actuary could have embezzled money without being caught. This strengthens the detective's argument, so it does not weaken it. 
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation could have had access to internal financial records, it would weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler must have worked for XYZ Corporation. 
  C: If there are more accountants than actuaries, it would weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries.

  - The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: From the given statements, we can conclude that every print sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work since the museum only displays twentieth-century works. However, we cannot conclude that every print in the store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection. We also cannot conclude that there are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector. We cannot determine whether Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan to the museum from a private collector or not, so we cannot conclude that it is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector. We also cannot determine whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum or not.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
The curator states that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, and prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. Therefore, every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. However, there is no information to suggest that every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection (choice A). There is also no information to suggest that there are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector (choice C). The curator does not state that Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan to the museum from a private collector (choice D). Finally, there is no information to suggest whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum (choice E).

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The question asks which scenario is best justified by the principles that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if they could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. If the accident does occur, he should not be blamed for it.
B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. If the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
C: Gougon did not think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. If the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know that giving his patient the wrong medicine would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. If no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm and started a fire. Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Kapp should be blamed for starting the fire.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The geologist argues that the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: This statement does not weaken the geologist's argument, because the presence of biomarkers in some fossils does not necessarily mean that all fossils lack biomarkers.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the geologist's argument, because the argument is not about when living organisms emerged.
  C: This statement does not weaken the geologist's argument, because the argument is not about how long it would take for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the geologist's argument, because the argument is not about whether bacteria can survive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: This statement weakens the geologist's argument, because it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which would support the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust.
  A: This weakens the geologist's argument, but it does not directly address the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  B: This statement is true, but it does not directly address the geologist's argument.
  C: This statement supports the geologist's argument, as it suggests that it would take a long time for petroleum to form from non-living material.
  D: This statement does not directly address the geologist's argument.
  E: This statement weakens the geologist's argument, as it suggests that some carbon deposits could have formed from the fossilized remains of plants, even if not all petroleum did.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: This weakens the geologist's argument only if it can be shown that these fossils are not the source of petroleum.
  B: This statement is true, but it does not specifically address the geologist's argument.
  C: This statement supports the geologist's argument.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the geologist's argument.
  E: This statement weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which is consistent with the dominant view.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust, and that this theory is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: This weakens the argument that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum is evidence that it is formed from the fossilized remains of living organisms.
  B: This is irrelevant to the argument.
  C: This supports the argument that it would take a long time for organisms to become petroleum, which implies that petroleum is formed from the fossilized remains of living organisms.
  D: This is irrelevant to the argument.
  E: This weakens the argument that petroleum is formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
- To weaken this argument, we need to find an answer choice that challenges the idea that biomarkers can only come from living organisms.

Action: Answer("A")
Explanation: 
If fossils devoid of biomarkers have been discovered, then it is possible that petroleum could have formed from those fossils without the presence of biomarkers. This weakens the argument that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum necessarily means that it formed from the fossilized remains of living organisms.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: This weakens the geologist's argument, but it does not explain how petroleum is formed.
  B: This statement is true, but it does not address how petroleum is formed.
  C: This statement supports the geologist's argument.
  D: This statement is true, but it does not address how petroleum is formed.
  E: This statement weakens the geologist's argument by providing an alternative source for carbon deposits.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum refutes the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  A: This weakens the argument that biomarkers are always present in fossils and petroleum.
  B: This does not directly address the argument.
  C: This supports the argument that it would take a long time for petroleum to form from deep carbon deposits.
  D: This does not directly address the argument.
  E: This weakens the argument that petroleum did not form from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument.
  C: This statement supports the geologist's argument.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  E: This statement weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting an alternative source for petroleum.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  A: This choice suggests that fossils can exist without biomarkers, which does not necessarily weaken the geologist's argument.
  B: This choice is irrelevant to the geologist's argument.
  C: This choice actually supports the geologist's argument by suggesting that it would take a long time for petroleum to form from non-living material.
  D: This choice is also irrelevant to the geologist's argument.
  E: This choice weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which supports the alternative theory that petroleum can form from non-living material.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
- The opposing theory is that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
- The geologist's argument is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum, indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
- We are looking for the answer choice that weakens the geologist's argument the most.

Analysis:
- Answer choice A does not weaken the geologist's argument because the presence of biomarkers in fossils is not relevant to the argument that petroleum is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
- Answer choice B does not weaken the geologist's argument because the argument is not about when living organisms emerged, but about how petroleum is formed.
- Answer choice C does not weaken the geologist's argument because the argument is not about the time it takes for organisms to become petroleum, but about how petroleum is formed.
- Answer choice D does not weaken the geologist's argument because the argument is not about whether bacteria exist deep inside the earth's crust, but about how petroleum is formed.
- Answer choice E weakens the geologist's argument because it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which supports the opposing theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that because many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they have an immunity to this microorganism. However, this assumption is not necessarily true since some people may be carriers of staphylococcus without developing symptoms, but they can still transmit the microorganism to others who may develop harmful symptoms.
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything that is morally right is just, which may not be true in all cases.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which may not be true in all cases.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which may not be true in all cases.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which may not be true in all cases.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors washing their hands less often than other health care professionals means that handwashing cannot prevent disease, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. However, not developing harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has immunity to infection by a microorganism. 
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. 
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true because they are not advertisers. 
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and that Isabel did not take the medication because she is still quite ill.

Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The student's argument is based on a faulty assumption that exposure to a microorganism without developing harmful symptoms implies immunity to that microorganism.
  A: This argument is based on a faulty assumption that everything morally right is just.
  B: This argument is based on an unsupported assumption that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: This argument is based on a faulty assumption that medication always either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
  D: This argument is based on a faulty assumption that a recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation.
  E: This argument is based on a faulty assumption that doctors are the only healthcare professionals responsible for preventing disease.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The student's argument is that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms implies that people have immunity to the microorganism. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms implies immunity.
A: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as denying the antecedent. It assumes that if an action is morally right, then it is just. If an action is not morally right, then it is not just. Thus, it concludes that some morally right actions are not just.
B: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as a false dichotomy. It assumes that writers of fiction are not advertisers, and thus, they never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
C: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as a non sequitur. It assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and thus, Isabel must still be quite ill because she did not take the medication.
D: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as a post hoc fallacy. It assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is caused by excessive taxation without providing any evidence to support this claim.
E: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as a hasty generalization. It assumes that doctors' failure to wash their hands frequently implies that hand-washing is not an effective procedure in preventing disease.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The student's argument is that because many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is equivalent to immunity.
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily the case.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily the case.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that the person has an immunity to the microorganism. This assumption is flawed because some people may have developed harmful symptoms in the past but have recovered and are now immune to the microorganism.
A: The argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
B: The argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
C: The argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
D: The argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is that if a person is not affected by a microorganism, then they must have immunity to that microorganism.
  A: This argument is about the relationship between morally right actions and actions that serve the interests of everyone. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  B: This argument is about the persuasive intentions of advertisers and writers of fiction. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  C: This argument is about the relationship between taking medication and curing a disease or alleviating its symptoms. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  D: This argument is about the relationship between taxation and business expansion. It is not similar to the student's argument.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms means that the person has an immunity to the microorganism. However, this is not always the case, as some people may have a natural resistance to the microorganism but not a complete immunity.
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.

Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms implies immunity to the microorganism. However, this assumption is not necessarily true since some people may be carriers of the microorganism without developing symptoms. 
A: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as denying the antecedent, where the consequent of a conditional statement is negated and the antecedent is inferred to be false. This is not similar to the student's argument.
B: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as a false analogy, where two things are compared that are not similar enough to warrant the comparison. This is not similar to the student's argument.
C: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as a non-sequitur, where the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. This is not similar to the student's argument.
D: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as post-hoc ergo propter hoc, where a causal relationship is assumed between two events that are merely correlated. This is not similar to the student's argument.
E: This argument involves a flawed pattern of reasoning known as hasty generalization, where a conclusion is drawn based on insufficient evidence. This is similar to the student's argument, where a conclusion is drawn based on an incomplete understanding of the relationship between exposure to a microorganism and immunity to it.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the movement of raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument also states that Diplodocus's neck could bend downward and extend below ground level, allowing it to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
A: The argument does not require this assumption.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision.
C: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's brain or blood supply.
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its very long neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: The argument does not require this assumption as it is not relevant to the conclusion.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision or head angle.
C: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's brain or blood supply.
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation. It only concludes that Diplodocus did not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is necessary for the argument to conclude that Diplodocus fed on underwater vegetation from dry land.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the feeding habits of the dinosaur Diplodocus.
  The computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation.
  
Assumption:
  An assumption required by the argument is not explicitly stated in the context. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the argument assumes that Diplodocus's feeding habits were limited by the structure of its neck bones, and that it had to adapt to its environment to find food. Therefore, the most likely assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus had to rely on the available food sources in its environment to survive.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the dinosaur from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation. However, the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  
A: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument only discusses the neck structure of Diplodocus and does not compare it to other animals.
B: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument only discusses the neck structure of Diplodocus and does not mention anything about its vision.
C: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument only discusses the neck structure of Diplodocus and does not mention anything about its brain.
D: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, so it had another way of accessing food besides rising up on its hind legs.
E: This assumption is required by the argument. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not consider the possibility of Diplodocus browsing for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but it could bend downward and extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. 
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument is about the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones and how it affected its feeding habits, not about the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument is about Diplodocus's feeding habits, not about its vision.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument is about Diplodocus's feeding habits, not about its brain or blood supply.
D: This statement contradicts the argument. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land by bending its neck downward and extending it below ground level. Therefore, it did not have to rely on rising up on its hind legs to access high-growing vegetation.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument is about Diplodocus's feeding habits, not about its ability to browse for underwater vegetation. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the dinosaur from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but that the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. The conclusion is that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: This statement is not necessary for the argument. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones, not on the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: This statement is not necessary for the argument. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones, not on its ability to see in front of itself.
C: This statement is not necessary for the argument. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones, not on the blood supply to its brain.
D: This statement is not necessary for the argument. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, so it is not necessary to assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: This statement is not necessary for the argument. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not address whether Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the dinosaur from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. Instead, the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument does not rely on the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument does not rely on Diplodocus's vision.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument does not rely on the blood supply to Diplodocus's brain.
D: This statement is not required by the argument. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, so it is not necessary for Diplodocus to have risen up on its hind legs to access high-growing vegetation.
E: This statement is not required by the argument. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, so it is not necessary for Diplodocus to have kneeled beside bodies of water or walked into them to browse for underwater vegetation.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation. Instead, it could bend its neck downward and even extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This statement is not necessary because the argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access vegetation.
  E: This statement is necessary because the argument assumes that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that Diplodocus could not have browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck, but instead must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater, because the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
 
A: The argument does not mention anything about the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals, so this assumption is not required by the argument.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's ability to see in front of itself, so this assumption is not required by the argument.
C: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's brain or blood supply, so this assumption is not required by the argument.
D: The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land by bending its neck downward and even extending it below ground level, so this assumption is not required by the argument.
E: The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not mention anything about kneeling beside bodies of water or walking into them, so this assumption is not required by the argument.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument is based on the premise that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal, and therefore the official results must be rigged. However, this is a classic example of a biased sample. The speaker is only considering the people they know, who may not be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population, which is the flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument presents evidence from a non-representative sample (the people the speaker knows) to conclude that the official results must be rigged. This is a classic example of the fallacy of hasty generalization, which occurs when a conclusion is drawn from a sample that is too small or unrepresentative. Therefore, the most accurate answer is A. The other options, while they may describe flaws in other arguments, are not relevant to this particular argument.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses a small and biased sample (the people the author knows) to conclude that the official results must be rigged, without considering the possibility that the sample is not representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument commits the fallacy of hasty generalization. Choice A accurately describes this flaw in the reasoning. Choice B describes the circular reasoning fallacy, which is not present in the argument. Choice C describes the ad hominem fallacy, which is also not present in the argument. Choice D describes a possible flaw, but it is not the most accurate one. Choice E describes the bandwagon fallacy, which is not present in the argument.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses a small and unrepresentative sample (the people the speaker knows) to try to disprove the official results of the referendum. This is a classic example of a hasty generalization fallacy, where a conclusion is drawn from insufficient evidence. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not mean that most people did. Therefore, the argument's reasoning is flawed. Choice A correctly describes this flaw by pointing out that the evidence is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The other choices do not accurately describe the flaw in the argument.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses anecdotal evidence from the people the speaker knows to conclude that the official results are rigged. However, this evidence is unlikely to be representative of the general population, which is what the official results reflect. Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses a small sample of people known to the arguer, rather than a representative sample of the general population. Therefore, the argument's conclusion that the official results must be rigged because everyone the arguer knows voted against the proposal is not necessarily valid. This is a classic example of the fallacy of hasty generalization. Choice A accurately describes this flaw in the argument. Choice B describes the circular reasoning fallacy, choice C describes the ad hominem fallacy, choice D describes a distinction without a difference, and choice E describes the bandwagon fallacy.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses a sample of people that the speaker knows, which is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The official results of the national referendum indicate that 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal, which suggests that the speaker's sample is not representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is based on the personal experience of the speaker and their circle, which is not a representative sample of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses a small, non-representative sample (the people the speaker knows) to make a claim about the larger population. Just because the speaker and their acquaintances voted against the proposal does not mean that most people did. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it relies on evidence that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw. Choices B, C, D, and E do not accurately describe the flaw in the reasoning.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses a small and biased sample (the people the speaker knows) to claim that the official results are rigged. This is a fallacy of hasty generalization. Therefore, the most accurate description of the flaw in the reasoning is that the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A is the best answer.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. So, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine?
Choices:
  A: All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water.
  B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
  C: A washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine.
  D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
  E: Washers that use more water get clothes cleaner than those that use less.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers because they use less water than top-loading washers. Therefore, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed.
  A: The argument does not depend on whether all top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water.
  B: The argument is about the effectiveness of detergents in front-loading washers, not about how well they work in top-loading washers.
  C: The argument does not state that laundry detergent formulated for a specific machine is required to get clothes really clean.
  D: This statement is consistent with the argument in the consumer magazine, but it is not an assumption required by the argument.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument in the consumer magazine.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading washer, one needs to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers.
  A: The argument does not depend on the amount of water used by top-loading washing machines, so this is not an assumption required by the argument.
  B: The argument is about the effectiveness of a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers in front-loading washers, not about how it compares to its effectiveness in top-loading washers, so this is not an assumption required by the argument.
  C: This answer choice is close to the argument, but it goes beyond it by saying that a laundry detergent specially formulated for a machine is the only way to get clothes really clean. The argument only says that a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, but it does not exclude the possibility that other detergents or methods might also work.
  D: This answer choice is very close to the argument, and it captures the idea that a detergent needs to dissolve readily in a washer to get clothes really clean. This is an assumption required by the argument.
  E: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument, which is about the effectiveness of a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers in front-loading washers, regardless of the amount of water used by the washer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent because ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument.
  C: This statement is too extreme and goes beyond the scope of the argument. The argument only talks about front-loading washers and the detergent that should be used in them.
  D: This statement is an assumption required by the argument because the argument is based on the premise that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers, and therefore, a laundry detergent that dissolves readily in the washer is required to get clothes really clean.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the consumer magazine states that front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, and that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. Therefore, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine.
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
B: This statement is not necessary for the argument, because the argument is about the need for a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, not about the differences between top-loading and front-loading washers.
C: This statement is not necessary for the argument, because the argument is not about the general effectiveness of laundry detergents, but about the need for a specific type of detergent for front-loading washers.
D: This statement is necessary for the argument, because the argument assumes that the reason why ordinary powder detergent does not work well in front-loading washers is because it does not dissolve readily in them.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers, so a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine.

  B: The argument is about front-loading washers, not top-loading washers.
  C: The argument does not make a claim about washing machines in general, only about front-loading washers.
  D: This assumption is required by the argument because the argument claims that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers, so a detergent that dissolves readily is needed to get clothes really clean.
  E: The argument does not make a claim about the relative effectiveness of washers that use more or less water.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:

Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

  In horror stories about mad scientists, the author's feeling is that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  The passage states that both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader. Therefore, any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader. However, the passage does not suggest that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature (choice A), that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed (choice C), that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views (choice D), or that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature (choice E).

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above assumes that the number of sociology majors and psychology majors enrolled in the class are the only factors that determine which major is more represented in the class. This assumption may not be true.
  A: This argument assumes that the Metro Art Museum only displays paintings it owns, which may not be true.
  B: This argument assumes that there are only two options: being in favor of spending more on roads or being in favor of spending more on parks.
  C: This argument assumes that the arboretum is representative of the San Felipe area, which may not be true.
  D: This argument assumes that the Valley Food Co-op and the Jumbo Supermarket are the only places where one can buy organic vegetables, which may not be true.
  E: This argument assumes that the number of houses and condominiums that Acme is offering for sale are the only factors that determine which type of property is more represented on the website. This assumption may not be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above assumes that the number of sociology majors taking Introduction to Social Psychology is greater than the number of psychology majors taking the same class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  A: The argument assumes that the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are owned by the museum.
  B: The argument assumes that the opinion poll is representative of the entire population of Silver Falls.
  C: The argument assumes that the San Felipe city arboretum is representative of the San Felipe area.
  D: The argument assumes that the Valley Food Co-op and Jumbo Supermarket are the only places to buy vegetables.
  E: The argument assumes that the number of houses and condominiums offered for sale by Acme Realty is equal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the question assumes that the number of students enrolled in the class is proportional to the number of majors in each field.
  A: The argument assumes that the number of paintings owned by the museum is proportional to the number of paintings on display.
  B: The argument assumes that the residents' opinions on spending are mutually exclusive.
  C: The argument assumes that the number of trees in the arboretum is proportional to the species of the trees.
  D: The argument assumes that the number of vegetables available at each store is proportional to the type of vegetables.
  E: The argument assumes that the number of houses and condominiums offered for sale by Acme Realty is proportional to the number of photos on their website.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument above assumes that the number of sociology majors and psychology majors in the class is related to the number of students enrolled in the class.
  A: The argument above is not about ownership or display of paintings, so it is not similar to this flawed pattern of reasoning.
  B: The argument above assumes that the opinions of those who participated in the opinion poll are representative of the opinions of all Silver Falls residents.
  C: The argument above assumes that the proportion of local and exotic species in the arboretum is representative of the proportion of local and exotic species in the San Felipe area.
  D: The argument above assumes that the number of organic vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op and Jumbo Supermarket is related to the number of vegetables available at each store.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument uses a conditional statement in the form "If P, then Q"
  The argument also uses the contrapositive of the conditional statement, which is "If not Q, then not P"
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover based on the premise that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.

Analysis:
  A: This argument uses a conditional statement and concludes that checking tire pressure regularly will prevent premature tire wear. The reasoning is valid.
  B: This argument uses a conditional statement and concludes that neglecting to check tire pressure regularly will cause premature tire wear. The reasoning is valid.
  C: This argument concludes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check tire pressure regularly based on the premise that tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check tire pressure regularly. The reasoning is valid.
  D: This argument uses a conditional statement and concludes that neglecting to check tire pressure regularly will cause premature tire wear. The reasoning is valid.
  E: This argument concludes that keeping tire pressure from becoming too low will not help a tire last longer if it is often driven on gravel roads based on the premise that a tire will wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. The reasoning is valid.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above presents a conditional statement that concludes with an "if-then" statement, but the conclusion is not necessarily true because it depends on a single cause-and-effect relationship. 
  A: This argument presents a valid conditional statement, but it does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above.
  B: This argument presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above, where the conclusion is based on a single cause-and-effect relationship.
  C: This argument presents a different pattern of reasoning, where the conclusion is based on a hypothetical scenario and not a cause-and-effect relationship.
  D: This argument presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above, where the conclusion is based on a single cause-and-effect relationship.
  E: This argument presents a different pattern of reasoning, where the conclusion is based on two possible causes for the same effect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above presents a conditional statement in the form of a hypothetical syllogism: if A then B, and if C then A; therefore, if C then B. The argument is flawed because it does not consider the possibility that squirrels might not be the only factor affecting the number of birds attracted to a feeder.
  A: This argument presents a valid conditional statement in the form of a hypothetical syllogism. It is not flawed.
  B: This argument presents a valid conditional statement in the form of a hypothetical syllogism. It is not flawed.
  C: This argument presents a valid conditional statement in the form of a hypothetical syllogism. It is not flawed.
  D: This argument presents a valid conditional statement in the form of a hypothetical syllogism. It is not flawed.
  E: This argument presents a conditional statement that is not in the form of a hypothetical syllogism. It is not similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument uses conditional statements to make a conclusion.
  The conclusion is that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument assumes that squirrels are the only reason why a bird feeder would not attract many birds.
  A: The argument is not about tires and tire pressure.
  B: The argument is similar to this one because it uses conditional statements to make a conclusion. However, the conclusion is different from the one in the original argument.
  C: The argument is not about car tires and tire pressure.
  D: The argument is similar to this one because it uses conditional statements to make a conclusion. However, the conclusion is different from the one in the original argument.
  E: The argument is not about car tires and tire pressure.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument presents a conditional statement that says that if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, then squirrels will eat from it, and as a result, it will not attract many birds. The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder might not attract many birds is because squirrels eat from it. 

A: This argument presents a conditional statement that says that if a tire's pressure is too low, then the tire will wear out prematurely. The argument concludes that if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely. This argument is not flawed.
B: This argument presents a conditional statement that says that if a tire's pressure is too low, then the tire will wear out prematurely. The argument concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. This argument is not flawed.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above presents a conditional statement: if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, then squirrels will eat from it and it will not attract many birds. The argument then concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because the argument assumes that the presence of squirrels is the only factor affecting the attractiveness of the bird feeder to birds.
  A: This argument presents a conditional statement: if a tire's pressure is too low, then the tire will wear out prematurely, and it concludes that checking the tire pressure regularly will prevent tires from wearing out prematurely. This argument is not flawed in the same way as the original argument.
  B: This argument presents a conditional statement: if a tire's pressure is too low, then the tire will wear out prematurely, and it concludes that neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly will cause tires to wear out prematurely. This argument is not flawed in the same way as the original argument.
  C: This argument concludes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure, but it does not present a flawed pattern of reasoning.
  D: This argument presents a conditional statement: if a tire's pressure is too low, then the tire will wear out prematurely, and it concludes that neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly will cause tires to wear out prematurely. This argument is not flawed in the same way as the original argument.
  E: This argument presents a conditional statement: if a tire's pressure is too low, then the tire will wear out prematurely, and it adds the additional condition that driving on gravel roads will also cause tires to wear out prematurely. It concludes that keeping tire pressure from becoming too low will not help tires to last longer if they are often driven on gravel roads. This argument is not flawed in the same way as the original argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risk of being victims of natural disasters than those who do not.
  
A: This statement does not weaken the argument since it does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks.
  
B: This statement suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, which contradicts the argument. Therefore, this weakens the argument.
  
C: This statement supports the argument by stating that people who watch a below-average amount of television have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of natural disasters.
  
D: This statement suggests that people who are well-informed about natural disasters tend to become informed through other means than watching television. However, this does not weaken the argument.
  
E: This statement suggests that people who live in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch an above-average amount of television. However, this does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
A: This statement doesn't directly address the argument. It talks about people overestimating dangers in general, not specifically in relation to watching television.
B: This statement does not weaken the argument. It talks about people who watch an above-average amount of television being less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which is irrelevant to the argument.
C: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that people who watch less television have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of natural disasters.
D: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well-informed about the risks of natural disasters tend to become well-informed in ways other than watching television.
E: This statement doesn't directly address the argument. It talks about the relationship between watching television and living in areas prone to natural disasters, not about the effect of watching television on people's perceptions of natural disasters.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. 
  The argument also claims that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.

A: This answer choice doesn't address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks. It is out of scope.
B: This answer choice actually supports the argument. If a person watches an above-average amount of television, and that person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, then the person is less likely to overestimate the risks of a natural disaster. Therefore, this answer choice strengthens the argument rather than weakening it.
C: This answer choice weakens the argument because it states that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. This suggests that the amount of television watched is related to overestimating risks.
D: This answer choice weakens the argument because it suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This suggests that watching television may not be the main factor in overestimating risks.
E: This answer choice doesn't address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks. It is out of scope.

Action: Answer("D")

E: This statement may be true, but it does not weaken the argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The argument claims that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not. We need to find an option that weakens this reasoning.
A: This option does not address the argument directly, as it talks about people in general and not about people who watch an above-average amount of television.
B: This option contradicts the argument, as it claims that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters. This information does not support the argument.
C: This option supports the argument, as it claims that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. This information strengthens the argument.
D: This option weakens the argument, as it claims that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This information suggests that watching television may not be the only factor that influences people's perception of the risks of natural disasters.
E: This option does not address the argument directly, as it talks about the relationship between natural disasters and television watching, but it does not provide information about whether people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors resulted in a substantial decrease in patient injuries at regional hospitals. The reason for this decrease is attributed to the fact that the knowledge of being monitored made the staff more meticulous in carrying out their duties.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not provide any information that can strengthen or weaken the argument.
  B: This statement weakens the argument, as it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be attributed to the implementation of the plan, but rather to other factors that may have affected the hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not provide any information that can strengthen or weaken the argument.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument, as it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries can be attributed to the implementation of the plan, and not to other factors that may have affected the hospitals.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not provide any information that can strengthen or weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  A year ago several regional hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record all staff errors that caused patient injuries, which has led to a substantial decrease in the incidence of these injuries.
  A: The hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient, but it is not clear how this strengthens the argument.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question, but it does not necessarily strengthen the argument that the decrease in injuries was due to the plan implemented by the hospitals.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not, which is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, which supports the argument that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors, but it is not clear how this strengthens the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - A plan was implemented to record all staff errors at several regional hospitals.
  - The incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors has substantially decreased since the implementation of the plan.
  - The argument claims that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries is due to the knowledge that staff errors were being carefully monitored, which made the hospitals' staff more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  
A: This statement does not provide any new information about the plan and how it affected the incidence of patient injuries.
B: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries may not be due to the implementation of the plan, but rather due to other factors that affected all regional hospitals, including the one that did not participate in the plan.
C: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries was indeed due to the implementation of the plan, as it started only after the staff became aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
E: This statement does not provide any new information about the plan and how it affected the incidence of patient injuries.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  A: The hospitals had a policy of investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased.
  C: The plan did not record staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries began after the implementation of the plan.
  E: The hospitals' staff members who made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.

Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: The argument states that the knowledge that the errors were being monitored made the hospitals' staffs more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties, which led to a substantial decrease in the incidence of patient injuries. Option D strengthens the argument by stating that the decrease in the incidence of injuries began after the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to systematically record staff errors resulted in a substantial decrease in patient injuries caused by staff errors. The reason for this decrease is attributed to the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored, which made the hospital staff more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
A: This statement provides information about a policy that was in place before the implementation of the plan. However, it does not provide any evidence to strengthen the argument.
B: This statement presents information about another hospital that did not participate in the plan but experienced a decrease in patient injuries. It does not provide any evidence to support the argument that the implementation of the plan resulted in the decrease in patient injuries.
C: This statement weakens the argument by providing information that suggests the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
D: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in the incidence of injuries began only after the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. This provides evidence to support the argument that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospital staff more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument as it provides information about the consequences of staff errors, not the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - A plan was implemented to record all staff errors in some hospitals to reduce patient injuries.
  - The incidence of patient injuries has decreased at these hospitals since the plan was implemented.
  - The argument is that the knowledge that errors were being monitored made staff more careful.
Choices:
  A: This statement is about investigating life-threatening injuries, which is not directly related to the plan implemented to reduce patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
  B: This statement suggests that something other than the plan implemented at the hospitals may have caused the decrease in patient injuries at the regional hospital that did not participate in the plan. It does not support the argument that the plan was effective.
  C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive enough to record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was a result of the staff becoming more careful after they became aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
  E: This statement is about the consequences of staff errors, which is not directly related to the effectiveness of the plan implemented to reduce patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  A: The hospitals had a policy of investigating life-threatening staff errors.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries decreased at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  C: The plan did not record staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of injuries began only after the staff became aware of the monitoring.
  E: Staff members received only reprimands for their first errors under the plan.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  The argument is that the plan to record staff errors reduced patient injuries. To strengthen this argument, we need to show that the reduction in patient injuries is due to the plan. Choice B provides evidence that the reduction in patient injuries is not due to other factors because a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also experienced a decrease in patient injuries. Therefore, we can conclude that the plan was the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries at the hospitals that implemented the plan has decreased since the plan was implemented. This is attributed to the fact that staff members became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties because they knew their errors were being monitored.
  
A: This statement provides information about the hospitals' policy before the plan was implemented but does not provide evidence that would strengthen the argument. 
B: This statement provides evidence that the incidence of patient injuries decreased at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan. However, this statement does not provide evidence that would strengthen the argument that the implementation of the plan caused the decrease in patient injuries at the hospitals that implemented the plan.
C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
D: This statement strengthens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was a result of the staff becoming more meticulous after they became aware that their errors were being monitored.
E: This statement provides information about the consequences of staff members making errors that cause injuries to patients, but it does not provide evidence that would strengthen the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors resulted in a substantial decrease in the incidence of patient injuries at several regional hospitals.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information that strengthens the argument.
  B: This statement weakens the argument because it implies that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries may not be solely attributed to the implementation of the plan.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information that strengthens the argument.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries was a direct result of the staff being aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information that strengthens the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that the implementation of a plan to systematically record all staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
  
A: This statement provides information about the hospitals' policy before the plan was implemented, but it does not strengthen the argument that the plan helped reduce the incidence of patient injuries.
  B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the reduction in patient injuries may not be due to the implementation of the plan.
  C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to capture all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: If this statement is true, it strengthens the argument by suggesting that the reduction in patient injuries was due to the implementation of the plan and not some other factor.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a penalty for pollution without sufficient evidence of the polluter's identity. 
A: This principle is directly relevant to the argument's reasoning, as it suggests that the severity of the penalty for pollution requires a higher standard of evidence to justify imposing it. 
B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the issue of uncertain evidence. 
C: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the issue of uncertain evidence. 
D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the issue of uncertain evidence. 
E: This principle is indirectly relevant to the argument's reasoning, but it suggests that the penalty should not be so severe as to preclude punishment entirely, whereas the argument is concerned with the difficulty of justifying punishment without sufficient evidence. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about whether or not there is enough evidence to justify imposing a severe penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.
  A: This principle states that the more severe the penalty is, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing the penalty. This principle supports the reasoning in the argument.
  B: This principle is about the appropriate severity of penalties for crimes, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  C: This principle is about the proportionality of penalties to the harm caused by an infraction, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  D: This principle suggests that severe penalties may discourage people from admitting responsibility, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  E: This principle suggests that penalties should not be so severe that they cannot be justified by the evidence, which supports the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument is discussing the difficulty of justifying a penalty for pollution when the identity of the polluter is uncertain. The argument suggests that the penalty is severe enough that a higher standard of certainty is required before imposing it.
A: This principle supports the argument's conclusion that a higher standard of certainty is required before imposing a severe penalty.
B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's conclusion about the level of certainty required to impose a penalty.
C: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's conclusion about the level of certainty required to impose a penalty.
D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's conclusion about the level of certainty required to impose a penalty.
E: This principle directly supports the argument's conclusion that a penalty cannot be justified if the level of certainty required to impose it is too high.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence or admission of responsibility.
  A: This principle is directly related to the argument's reasoning, stating that the severity of the penalty must be proportional to the certainty of guilt.
  B: This principle is discussing the general idea of appropriate penalties, but it is not directly related to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This principle is discussing the general idea of proportional penalties, but it is not directly related to the argument's reasoning.
  D: This principle is discussing the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for a severe offense, but it is not directly related to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This principle is directly related to the argument's reasoning, stating that the severity of the penalty must not be so great that it cannot be justified by the certainty of guilt.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the penalty for the pollution is so severe that stronger evidence is needed to justify imposing it.
  A: This principle is similar to the argument, stating that a more severe penalty requires a higher standard of proof.
  B: This principle is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument, as it does not address the standard of proof required to impose a penalty.
  D: This principle is not relevant to the argument, as it concerns the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense.
  E: This principle directly supports the argument, stating that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument is discussing the difficulty in imposing a severe penalty on the local auto repair shop without stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility. 
A: This principle supports the argument's reasoning that a higher burden of proof is necessary before imposing a severe penalty.

C: This principle is related to the severity of the penalty, but it does not address the issue of uncertainty about the identity of the polluter. 
D: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning about the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility. 
E: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning that a penalty should not be imposed if there is not sufficient certainty of guilt. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a penalty for pollution due to lack of certainty about the identity of the polluter.
  A: This principle is directly related to the argument, as it states that a higher penalty requires a higher level of certainty about guilt. However, it does not address the issue of certainty in the argument.
  B: This principle is not related to the argument, as it discusses the general idea of appropriate penalty levels, rather than the issue of certainty in imposing a penalty.
  C: This principle is related to the argument, but it does not address the issue of certainty in imposing a penalty. It discusses the idea of proportional penalties based on harm caused, which is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This principle is not related to the argument, as it discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, rather than the issue of certainty in imposing a penalty.

A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.

Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The Florida panther population has increased from the 1970s but it is still not self-sustaining.
  - The current habitat of the Florida panther is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  
A: The statement may be true, but it is not a necessary conclusion from the given information.
B: The statement contradicts the given information that the population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. 
C: This is a necessary conclusion from the given information that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
D: The statement contradicts the given information that the population has increased from the 1970s.
E: The statement contradicts the given information that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The Florida panther population has increased but is not yet self-sustaining.
  Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  
A: The passage mentions that the current habitat is not large enough to support more panthers, but it does not indicate that any part of the habitat is of marginal quality. Therefore, A is not necessarily true.
B: The passage states that the population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining, but it does not suggest that exceeding that number would guarantee self-sustainability. Therefore, B is not necessarily true.
C: The passage states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers, and it also states that the population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Therefore, C must be true.
D: The passage indicates that the population has increased significantly from the 1970s, but it does not suggest that the population will never increase much beyond its current level. Therefore, D is not necessarily true.
E: The passage does not indicate that the Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat today than they did in the 1970s. Therefore, E is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The current Florida panther population is between 70 to 100 individuals.
  - The population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  - The current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  
A: The fact that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers does not necessarily mean that some part of the habitat is only of marginal quality. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
B: This statement is not necessarily true because it does not address the issue of habitat size.
C: This statement is true because the passage states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, and that the population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
D: This statement is not necessarily true because the passage states that the current population represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s.
E: The passage does not provide any information to support or refute this statement.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Florida panthers' current population is 70 to 100.
  - Their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  - Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  
A: There is no information in the passage that supports this statement. It is not a must be true statement.
B: This statement is not a must be true statement. It is not mentioned in the passage whether the population will be self-sustaining if it exceeds 250.
C: This statement must be true. The passage clearly states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals and that their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
D: This statement is not a must be true statement. The passage mentions that the population has increased significantly since the 1970s, but it does not make any predictions about future population growth.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), and their ability to remember to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time. Group A had only one lapse, while Group B had fourteen lapses. The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  A: This statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it ensures that the size of each group is not a factor in the results.
  B: This statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it ensures that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by both groups, eliminating any potential bias in the results.
  C: This statement is not helpful in establishing the conclusion because it is not relevant to the comparison between the two groups' ability to remember to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  D: This statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it ensures that both groups had equal access to the resources necessary to complete the task.
  E: This statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it ensures that both groups had approximately the same amount of time to prepare for the task.

Topic: Law
Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
Question: The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: widespread cynicism is beneficial to the wellbeing of society
  B: cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the am01mt of information one has about them
  C: the work of contemporary journalists reflects a cynicism that is not really genuine
  D: any accurate description of human bebavior portrays it as selfish
  E: cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society
Response 0:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist claims that a study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates the symptoms of insomnia in people aged 65-81.
  The pharmacist also claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are evidently correct.
  The manufacturers' claim is that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  
A: This choice is not relevant to the argument presented by the pharmacist.
B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of biased individuals.
C: The argument does not use two different meanings for the same term.
D: This choice is the best answer. The argument confuses the effect of a phenomenon (melatonin alleviating insomnia symptoms) with its cause (the pineal gland producing less melatonin as it ages).
E: There is no information to suggest that the sample used in the study is unrepresentative.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist argues that a study showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  The pharmacist then concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
  
A: This choice describes a flaw in reasoning called "post hoc ergo propter hoc" (after this, therefore because of this), which means inferring causation from correlation. However, the argument does not commit this flaw.
  B: This choice describes a flaw in reasoning called "source bias," which means relying on biased sources. However, the argument does not commit this flaw.
  C: This choice describes a flaw in reasoning called "equivocation," which means using two different meanings of the same term to draw a conclusion. However, the argument does not commit this flaw.
  D: This choice describes a flaw in reasoning called "confusing cause and effect," which means mistaking the cause of a phenomenon for its effect. However, the argument does not commit this flaw.
  E: This choice describes a flaw in reasoning called "sampling bias," which means relying on a sample that is unrepresentative of the population. This is a plausible flaw in the argument, as the argument only refers to a study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia, which may not be representative of the general population.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that a study showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. The argument concludes that recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
A: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased.
C: The argument does not depend on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
D: This choice is relevant to the argument. The argument confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause. The study shows that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia's symptoms, but it does not prove that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages. The argument assumes that the cause of insomnia is the pineal gland producing less melatonin as it ages, but this is not proven by the study.
E: The argument does not rely on a sample that is unrepresentative.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist argues that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because a large study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates most of insomnia's symptoms. The study was conducted on people aged 65-81. Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland and plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock.
  A: This choice is not related to the argument made by the pharmacist.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased.
  C: This choice is not related to the argument made by the pharmacist.
  D: This choice is the closest to the flaw in the argument made by the pharmacist. The argument confuses the effect of melatonin on insomnia symptoms with the cause of insomnia, which is not necessarily related to the amount of melatonin produced by the pineal gland.
  E: The argument does not provide enough information to determine whether the sample used in the study is representative or not.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist's argument claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct because a large study showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  A: Inferring from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect is a fallacy of equivocation, which is not present in the argument.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased.
  C: The argument does not depend on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment with 50 patients with chronic back pain. One group received small magnets applied to their backs, while the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, but very few in the second group did.
  A: This statement is not a counterargument to the physician's argument, as it is discussing a different phenomenon.
  B: This statement is not a counterargument to the physician's argument, as it is discussing the effectiveness of medication versus magnets, not the effectiveness of magnets alone.
  C: This statement is not a strong counterargument to the physician's argument, as it only limits the generalizability of the experiment to other areas of pain relief.
  D: This statement is not a counterargument to the physician's argument, as it only discusses the beliefs of some of the scientists involved in the experiment, not the actual results of the experiment.
  E: This statement is the strongest counterargument to the physician's argument, as it suggests that the variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain could have affected the results of the experiment and that the effectiveness of magnets could be limited to specific causes of chronic back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the first group's pain could be due to the placebo effect. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  B: This statement is an opinion and does not provide any evidence that counters the physician's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that the experiment may not be generalizable to other areas of pain, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  D: This statement suggests that the scientists who designed the experiment may have had a bias towards magnetic fields, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  E: This statement suggests that the variation in the causes of the chronic back pain could have affected the results of the experiment, which counters the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument is about whether the university president's speech was inappropriate solely based on Professor Riley's testimony. The argument concludes that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.

A: The argument does not take for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory. Rather, it argues that there must be independent reasons to deem the speech inflammatory for it to be inappropriate. Incorrect.
B: The argument does not address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences. It only argues that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate. Incorrect.
C: The argument does not favor the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing. It only argues that Professor Riley's testimony alone is not sufficient to conclude that the president's speech was inappropriate. Incorrect.
D: The argument does not conclude that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true. Rather, it argues that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate. Incorrect.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. 
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
  A: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
  B: The passage does not provide any information about the knowledge of the people who designed the new program.
  C: The passage does not provide any information about the government's report for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government's new program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and used that figure as its estimate of employment. If some employers in X issued separate paychecks for different types of payment, the number of paychecks would be greater than the actual number of people employed. Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: The passage does not provide any information to support this conclusion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:

  The new computer program used by the government of Country X simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. 
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis: 
  The new program used by the government of Country X to determine the number of people employed in the country simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. However, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed may not be accurate.

Action: Answer("D")  
The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country in 1988.

  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X to estimate employment counts the number of paychecks issued per pay period by employers in X. However, some employers in X issue separate paychecks for different types of pay. Therefore, the program may overestimate the number of people employed in X. 
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Therefore, the best conclusion that can be drawn from the information given is that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 5:

  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  The new computer program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. So, the correct answer is D.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and uses that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The new program simply tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and uses that figure as its estimate of employment. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed may have been affected. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers to estimate employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis: 
  Since some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses and commissions, the number of paychecks per pay period would not be an accurate estimate of employment. Therefore, the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used would be overestimated. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers to estimate the number of people employed in that country.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
A: The information does not suggest that the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before. There is no information about the accuracy of the estimate before the new program was used.
B: The information does not suggest that the people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period. There is no information about the knowledge of the program designers.
C: The information does not suggest that the government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used. There is no information about the employment growth in the quarters before the new program was used.
D: The fact that some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions suggests that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. Therefore, D is the correct answer.
E: The information does not suggest that there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used. There is information that the government reported a large increase in the number of people employed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago, but now it accounts for only 25 percent of such sales. It also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. The conclusion drawn from these premises is that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It clearly states that the hair dryer's market share has declined from 50 percent to 25 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them, as it is only concerned with the net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers, as it is only concerned with the sales of the hair dryer.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which could have offset any decline in sales volume. This is a flaw in the reasoning.
E: The argument does not discuss whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products, so this choice is not relevant to the flaw in the reasoning.

  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It simply mentions that the company's product accounts for a smaller percentage of total sales.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them because it only focuses on Wilson Appliance Company's product.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers because it only focuses on the hair dryer product.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which could affect the net income per hair dryer sold.
E: The argument does not provide information about whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago, but currently, it accounts for only 25 percent of such sales. The average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It clearly states that the hair dryer's market share has declined from 50 percent to 25 percent.
B: The argument does not require specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. It only considers the net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold.
C: The argument does not fail to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers. It only focuses on the hair dryer product.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years. If the price increased, it could have offset the decline in the market share of the hair dryer and maintained the company's net income.
E: The argument does not provide any evidence about whether the hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has declined from 50% to 25% over the last 5 years and that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. It concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It is clear that the market share has declined, and the argument assumes that the total sales have declined as well.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. The argument is concerned with the net income of Wilson Appliance Company and not with the profits of the hair dryer industry in general.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers because the argument is only concerned with the sales of hair dryers.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which could have resulted in an increase in net income despite the decline in market share. Therefore, this choice is the correct answer.
E: The argument does not provide evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago, and currently, the company's product makes up only 25% of such sales. 
  The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The conclusion is that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: This is correct. The argument assumes that the decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is due to a decline in the total sales of that product. However, there could be other hair dryer brands that have entered the market, which may have caused a decline in Wilson's market share, even if the total sales of hair dryers have gone up. 
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them to be valid.
C: The argument is only concerned with the sales figures of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers, so it does not need to discuss sales figures for other products.
D: The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the past 5 years, so an increase in the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer would not affect the conclusion.
E: The argument does not provide any information about the profitability of Wilson Appliance's other products, so this choice is irrelevant.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% over the last 5 years.
  The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the last 5 years.
  The argument states that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the last 5 years. However, this assumption is not supported by the argument and may not be true. The decline in market share may be due to an increase in competition or a decrease in demand for hair dryers overall. Therefore, the conclusion that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago is not necessarily true.

Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% of all hair dryer sales nationwide over the last 5 years.
  The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: This is the correct answer. The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is the same as the decline in total sales of the product. However, it is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased over the last 5 years, which means that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales could have increased even though its market share declined. Therefore, the conclusion that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago is not necessarily true.
  
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them in order to be valid.

C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers in order to be valid.

D: The argument assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Therefore, the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years does not affect the argument's validity.

E: The argument does not need to provide independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products in order to be valid.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that Wilson Appliance Company's net income from sales of their hair dryer product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago because the product's market share has declined from 50% to 25%, and the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in market share for a decline in total sales. Instead, the argument uses the decline in market share to infer a decline in net income from sales of the product.
B: The argument is not concerned with the profits that hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. It is only concerned with the net income generated by Wilson Appliance Company from sales of their hair dryer product.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance Company's products other than hair dryers, as the argument only concerns the net income generated by sales of the hair dryer product.
D: The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has remained constant over the last 5 years, so the possibility of a retail price increase is irrelevant to the conclusion.
E: The argument does not provide any evidence about the profitability of other products produced by Wilson Appliance Company. It only focuses on the net income generated by sales of the hair dryer product.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the iguana species on a small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  B: If the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, this would suggest that they did not simply raft over from the Americas, and would weaken the argument.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses does not necessarily mean that it is impossible, so this statement does not weaken the argument.
  D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, this would suggest that the ancestors of the iguanas on the islands could have come from Australia, not the Americas, and would weaken the argument.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the scientist's argument about the iguanas.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the scientist's argument. The genetic differences between the iguana species on the islands and those found in the Americas do not contradict the idea that the progenitors of the island species rafted across the Pacific Ocean.
  C: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that rafting is uncommon among iguanas or that it may not have been a viable means of transport for the progenitors of the island species.
  D: This statement does not necessarily weaken the argument because it is possible that the progenitors of the island species rafted from Australia rather than the Americas.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the scientist's argument about the iguanas.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, citing studies conducted 30 years ago to support this claim. The council members argue that the increase would not decrease safety because they would purchase the latest safety technology.
  
A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it does not accurately describe the flaw. The argument does not draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement inferred from a very limited number of particular instances. Instead, the argument draws on studies conducted 30 years ago to support its claim.
B: This choice describes a possible flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate description of the flaw. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is. Instead, the argument claims that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
C: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the argument. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago. Instead, the argument claims that the increase would decrease safety, despite the council members' claims that it would not.
D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim. The argument cites studies conducted 30 years ago to support its claim that safety would be reduced by increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity. However, the argument does not provide any evidence that the latest safety technology would be insufficient to prevent this reduction in safety.
E: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the argument. The argument does not fail to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind. Instead, the argument claims that safety would be reduced by increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity, regardless of any potential benefits.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  A: This choice is not a direct criticism of the argument. It discusses the possibility of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents, but it does not address the argument's claim about the safety of bicyclists in general.
  B: This choice is not a direct criticism of the argument. It discusses the possibility of the number of bicyclists on roads with bicycle lanes versus roads without such lanes, but it does not address the argument's claim about the safety of bicyclists in general.
  C: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument. The argument assumes that any alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists, but that may not be the case. For example, adding bicycle lanes may cause more congestion and delays for motorists, which could increase the risk of accidents.
  D: This choice is not a direct criticism of the argument. It discusses the possibility that only some roads that currently have bicycle lanes are safe, but it does not address the argument's claim about the safety of bicyclists in general.
  E: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument. The argument uses statistical evidence to support its claim, but the evidence may not be relevant or may be misinterpreted. For example, the evidence may not account for other factors that affect the safety of bicyclists, such as the design of the bicycle lanes or the behavior of motorists.

Knowledge: 
  The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  
A: This option suggests that the injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes could be as serious as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes. However, this does not directly criticize the argument's conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  
B: This option suggests that there may be more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than on roads without such lanes. However, this does not directly criticize the argument's conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  
C: This option suggests that the argument takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists. However, the argument does not make this assumption, so this option is not a valid criticism of the argument.
  
D: This option suggests that the argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe. However, the argument does not make this assumption, so this option is not a valid criticism of the argument.
  
E: This option suggests that the argument takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion. This is a valid criticism of the argument, as the statistics provided do not necessarily support the conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.

C: This choice is not relevant to the argument's conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists. The argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  
D: This choice is incorrect because the argument does not conclude that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe. The argument concludes that adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  
E: This choice is correct. The argument takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion. The argument infers that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the fact that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. However, the statistic does not necessarily imply causation, and it is possible that other factors, such as higher traffic volume, may be responsible for the higher collision rate on roads with bicycle lanes.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

E: The argument discusses the impact of restricting land development in wilderness areas on species preservation and proliferation. This argument is different from the given argument, which discusses the impact of universal adoption of a diet on marine species.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument presented here is that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat, but if everyone adopted this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible. Therefore, the argument concludes that the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.

Action: Answer("E") 

The reasoning in option E is similar to the argument presented in the question. The argument suggests that restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve species, but it also reduces the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas. Therefore, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas. Similarly, in the argument presented in the question, adopting a healthier diet based on fish protein would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible. Therefore, the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.

B: The argument presents that governments have the right to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education, but if the taxes become too high, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education, so such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
C: The argument presents that a consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income, but if everyone did this, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people, so this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
D: The argument presents that if legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected, but if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected, so it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
E: The argument presents that if we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas, but we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas, so it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Action: Answer("C")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decoration, are not blocked and can also be distracting.
  A: The argument is about moderation and how it fails to take into account people's biological differences. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  B: The argument is about banning a device due to its potential to cause cancer, but the comparison to chemicals is made in terms of high doses. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  C: The argument is about the number of employees that a company needs to hire to replace those who retire. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  D: The argument is about engaging characters in creative writing and how it does not guarantee success. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  E: The argument is about how success in the movie industry is measured and how it can be counterintuitive. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.

B: The argument is about how activists are calling for a ban on an electronic device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals, but most chemicals probably cause cancer in high doses, yet we do not ban all these chemicals.
C: The argument is that Acme expects 1,000 of its employees to retire and therefore will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year, which is a logical conclusion.
D: The argument is that aspiring writers are told that engaging characters are necessary for a successful novel, but this does not guarantee a sale because publishers and agents may reject manuscripts that focus too much on character.
E: The argument is that a film's success should not be judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost, because this criterion is counter-intuitive.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The employee argues that website filtering software does not necessarily improve productivity, as other factors such as office environment can also be distracting. 
A: This argument is about individual differences in how people react to certain substances, and how moderation cannot be uniformly applied. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
B: This argument is about the limitations of banning a device based on findings from animal studies, as many chemicals can cause cancer in high doses. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
C: This argument is about the need for a company to hire new employees to replace those who retire. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
D: This argument is about the misconception that engaging characters are the only important factor in selling a novel or story. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute

Choices:
  A: the rug store in Glendale sold rugs of inferior quality
  B: it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale
  C: it is possible to determine the market for rugs in Glendale
  D: any other stores have gone out of business in Glendale
  E: rug stores can close because of insufficient demand for rugs
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The dialogue suggests that Mario thinks that rugs are not in demand in Glendale, and therefore, it would be a bad idea to open a rug store there. Renate, on the other hand, disagrees with Mario's conclusion, arguing that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, the most reasonable inference is that they disagree on whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. 

Option A is not supported by the dialogue. There is no mention of the quality of the rugs sold by the store. 

Option C is not directly addressed in the dialogue. 

Option D is not relevant to the topic of the dialogue. 

Option E is partially supported by the dialogue, but it is not the main point of disagreement between Mario and Renate.
Response 1:

The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Mario suggests that since the only rug store in Glendale went out of business, there is little demand for rugs in Glendale and thus it would be a product to avoid. Renate disagrees with Mario and suggests that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, the disagreement is about whether opening a rug store in Glendale is a good idea or not. 

Choices A, C, D, and E are not supported by the dialogue.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The dialogue suggests that Mario believes that it is not a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale because the only rug store in the area went out of business. Renate disagrees with Mario and suggests that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Thus, the correct answer is B.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Mario suggests that the only rug store in Glendale went out of business because there is little demand for rugs in Glendale. Therefore, he advises Renate to avoid rugs if she is planning to open a new business in Glendale. On the other hand, Renate disagrees and suggests that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Mario thinks that since the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business, there is little demand for rugs in Glendale and hence it would be a bad idea to open a rug store there.

  Mario suggests that since the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business, there is little demand for rugs in Glendale, so opening a new business selling rugs would not be a good idea.
  Renate disagrees with Mario's conclusion and suggests that the closing of the store had little to do with the product it sold.

Analysis:
  The disagreement between Mario and Renate is about whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale, given that the only rug store in the area has gone out of business. Mario thinks that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale, while Renate thinks that the closing of the store had little to do with the product it sold.

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Mario suggests that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale and therefore it would be a bad idea to open a rug store there. Renate disagrees and suggests that the closing of the only rug store in Glendale had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. This is best supported by the fact that Mario suggests avoiding rugs as a product to sell, while Renate suggests that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori should not be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens immune response and only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10 percent of those who harbor it. The argument compares it to Mycobacter tuberculosis, which also only causes sickness in about 10 percent of those who harbor it, but is not considered a commensal.
  A: This statement is about the treatment of stomach ulcers and tuberculosis, which is not relevant to the argument about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal or not.
  B: This statement is about the duration of tuberculosis and ulcers caused by H pylori, which is not relevant to the argument about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal or not.
  C: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the presence of M tuberculosis does not provide any benefit to the person who harbors it, which weakens the comparison made between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  D: This statement is about the number of people who harbor M tuberculosis and H pylori, which is not relevant to the argument about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal or not.
  E: This statement is about the number of people who harbor H pylori and M tuberculosis, which is not relevant to the argument about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal or not.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal despite its role in causing stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal despite the fact that most people who harbor it do not get sick from it.
  A: This statement provides information about treatment options for the two diseases, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement provides information about the duration of the two diseases, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement provides information that supports the argument's reasoning, but it does not undermine it.
  D: This statement provides information about the number of people who harbor the two bacteria, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  E: If there are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis, this could suggest that H pylori is more likely to be a commensal than M tuberculosis, which would undermine the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response. The counterexample is that M tuberculosis does not provide any benefit to people who harbor it, even though only about 10% of them get sick from it. 
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument.
C: This statement supports the argument by providing a counterexample.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
E: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that H pylori is more likely to be a commensal than M tuberculosis.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether Helicobacter pylori should be considered a commensal or not, despite the fact that it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers.
  The argument compares H pylori to Mycobacter tuberculosis, another bacterium that can cause disease in humans.
  The argument states that only about 10 percent of the people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it, yet no one would call it a commensal.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning by suggesting that M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because people who harbor it derive no benefit from its presence.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that if the number of people who harbor H pylori is significantly higher than those who harbor M tuberculosis, then it is possible that H pylori is a commensal despite its role in causing stomach ulcers.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that just because only a small percentage of people develop stomach ulcers from H pylori, it does not mean that it is a commensal. The argument compares H pylori with M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning because it suggests that people who harbor M tuberculosis do not derive any benefit from its presence.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that the number of people who harbor H pylori is greater than the number of people who harbor M tuberculosis, which means that H pylori is more likely to be a commensal than M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument is trying to establish that H pylori is not a commensal, despite its alleged benefits, because it causes stomach ulcers in some people. The comparison to M tuberculosis is used to support this claim by pointing out that M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal despite the fact that it causes disease in only a small percentage of those who harbor it.

A: This statement provides information about the treatment of stomach ulcers and tuberculosis, but it does not address the argument's reasoning. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.
B: This statement provides information about the duration of tuberculosis and ulcers caused by H pylori, but it does not address the argument's reasoning. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.
C: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the presence of M tuberculosis does not provide any benefit to those who harbor it, which weakens the argument's claim that H pylori cannot be a commensal because it causes disease in some people.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This supports the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. This is not relevant to the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances. This is not relevant to the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. This is not relevant to the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.

Knowledge:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  Evidence cited is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  
A: This information doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered by the naturalists. The polar bear could have stopped and changed course for many reasons.
B: This information doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered by the naturalists. The fact that the site was on the bear's annual migration route could be a reason why it was able to find its way home.
C: This information doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered by the naturalists. The fact that the route consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice could be a reason why it was able to find its way home.
D: This information doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered by the naturalists. The fact that other species of mammal have been known to find their way home from considerable distances doesn't mean that polar bears can't do the same.
E: This information doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered by the naturalists. The fact that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory doesn't mean that they can't navigate over considerable distances.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
  The argument also claims that the colon cancer rate in Western countries is higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, the argument claims that there is a correlation between higher colon cancer rates and lower consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  
A: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning.
B: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning.
C: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning.
D: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning.
E: This statement is a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning. If foods containing fiber also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer, then the argument's conclusion that fiber is the sole cause of the negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence is weakened. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion. The argument is about the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer, not about changes in fiber consumption over time.
B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion. The argument is specifically about colon cancer, not about the risk of other types of cancer.
C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion. The argument is not about the difficulty of including fiber in one's diet, but rather about the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
D: This statement is relevant to the argument's conclusion. If the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees, then the argument's conclusion that "sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer" may be too simplistic.
E: This statement is relevant to the argument's conclusion. If foods containing fiber also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer, then the argument's conclusion that "insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer" may be too simplistic.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It argues that colon cancer rates are higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods, compared to many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods. The argument also cites a study in Scandinavia that found a negative correlation between the consumption of cereals (which are high in fiber) and the incidence of colon cancer.
  
A: The argument is focused on the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates, so whether fiber consumption is rising in many countries is not relevant to the argument.
B: This choice provides support for the argument's conclusion rather than criticizing the argument's reasoning, so it is not the best answer.
C: The argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not distinguish between the different types of fiber in fruits and vegetables and cereals, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
E: This choice presents an alternative explanation for the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates, which is a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets are negatively correlated with the incidence of colon cancer.
  The argument provides evidence that supports the claim, such as the colon cancer rate being higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: The argument does not concern itself with changes in the consumption of fiber over time, so this is not a relevant criticism.
B: This statement, even if true, does not address the argument's claim that high-fiber diets are negatively correlated with colon cancer.
C: The argument does not address whether it is difficult for people to consume fiber. This statement is not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not address whether different types of fiber have different cancer-fighting properties. This statement is not relevant to the argument.
E: This statement is a possible criticism of the argument. The argument assumes that it is the fiber alone that prevents colon cancer, but it is possible that other substances in fiber-rich foods also contribute to preventing colon cancer. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It further supports this claim by citing examples of Western and non-Western countries and the consumption of cereals, fruits, and vegetables. Finally, the argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning, as it does not address the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning because it does not address the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer. Additionally, the argument asserts that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer, so the difficulty of including fiber in one's diet would not undermine this relationship.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning because it does not address the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer. Additionally, the argument's conclusion is based on the premise that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer, regardless of the degree of cancer-fighting properties in different sources of fiber.
E: This statement is the most likely answer because it suggests that the argument overlooks the possibility that other substances in foods containing fiber may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, rather than fiber itself. This would weaken the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a negative correlation exists between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. The colon cancer rate is lower in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods. In Scandinavia, a lower consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber, is associated with a higher colon cancer rate. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: The argument is focused on the relationship between fiber and colon cancer, and the fact that the consumption of fiber is rising in many countries does not affect the argument's reasoning. This choice is not the best answer.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument is specifically discussing the relationship between fiber and colon cancer, not other types of cancer.
C: This choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument does not address the difficulty of including fiber in one's diet.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument does not address the differences in cancer-fighting properties between the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals.
E: This choice presents an alternative explanation for the relationship between fiber and colon cancer. If foods containing fiber also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer, then the argument's conclusion that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer may be flawed. This is the best answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate in Western countries is higher than in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, it has been shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  
A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably or not, so it is not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument does not address whether the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fiber diets or not, so it is not relevant to the argument.
C: The argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets or not, so it is not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not address whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees or not, so it is not relevant to the argument.
E: This choice presents a possibility that the argument overlooks. The argument assumes that fiber is the only substance in foods that prevents colon cancer, but this choice suggests that there may be other substances in fiber-containing foods that also prevent colon cancer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets can prevent colon cancer.
  A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fiber is rising appreciably in many countries or not.

Finally, the argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

A: The argument is focused on the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer, and does not address whether the consumption of fiber is increasing or decreasing. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument and can be eliminated.

B: The argument does not discuss the risk of other types of cancer and is solely focused on colon cancer. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument and can be eliminated.

C: The argument does not address the difficulty of including fiber in one's diet, but instead focuses on the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument and can be eliminated.

D: The argument does not distinguish between the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals, but instead treats all fiber as having the same effect on colon cancer. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument and can be eliminated.

E: This choice suggests that foods containing fiber may also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer. The argument does not address this possibility, and if true, it could weaken the argument's conclusion that fiber alone is the cause of the negative correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer.

It is also mentioned that more vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary. Therefore, it is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week. Hence, the correct answer is C.
Response 6:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks, when in captivity, are more susceptible to fatal diseases compared to when they are in the wild.
  The likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
C: This statement provides an explanation for why leatherbacks in the wild may not reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy. However, it does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy.
D: This statement provides a possible explanation for why leatherbacks in captivity may be susceptible to fatal diseases. However, it does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks, when in captivity, are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  The likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
  
A: This statement does not help resolve the discrepancy between the two facts.
B: This statement provides a general information about the average life expectancy of sea turtles and does not help to resolve the discrepancy between the two facts.
C: This statement provides a reason for the death of most leatherbacks in the wild, but it does not help to resolve the discrepancy between the two facts.
D: This statement also does not help to resolve the discrepancy between the two facts.
E: This statement provides a possible explanation for why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild. If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, then it is possible that captive leatherbacks are not actually living longer than those in the wild, but rather they are simply being misidentified as older due to their size. Therefore, this statement helps to resolve the discrepancy between the two facts.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.

  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("B")  
The science journalist's statement supports that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.

Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.

Topic: Law
Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument presents a conditional statement, where it is assumed that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, then the inflation rate would have lessened. However, it is concluded that because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark. This is a flawed reasoning because there could be other factors that contributed to the inflation rate increase, and the argument assumes that the party's economic theories were the only factor.

Action: Answer("C") 
The flawed reasoning in option C is similar to the reasoning in the argument above because it presents a conditional statement where it is assumed that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, then the stock price would have doubled in the last two years. However, it is concluded that because the price of the stock did not increase in that time, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This is a flawed reasoning because there could be other factors that contributed to the stock price not increasing, and the argument assumes that the company's failure to sell its subsidiaries was the only factor.
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument presented in the context is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were the only factor affecting the inflation rate. It is possible that other factors contributed to the increase in the inflation rate.
A: The argument assumes that the only reason for changes in the valley's architecture would be invasion or climatic change. It ignores other possible reasons for changes in architecture.
B: The argument assumes that the workers' promise not to strike is based on their belief that the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. It ignores other possible reasons for the workers' promise.
C: The argument assumes that the only way for the company's stock price to double is for it to sell its subsidiaries and purchase the new patent. It ignores other possible ways for the stock price to increase.
D: The argument assumes that the only reason for the residents' support of the rebels is the outcome of the battle. It ignores other possible reasons for the residents' support.
E: The argument assumes that the only reason for the television station's ratings to increase is the accuracy of its forecasts. It ignores other possible reasons for changes in ratings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument above assumes that the party's economic theories were the only factor that could have affected the inflation rate, and that the party's failure to implement its program was the only reason why the inflation rate increased. This is a flawed assumption because there could have been other factors that affected the inflation rate, and the party's program may not have been the only solution to the problem.
A: This argument assumes that the only reason why there were no changes in the valley's architecture was because the valley people were not invaded. This is a flawed assumption because there could have been other reasons why the architecture remained the same.
B: This argument assumes that the workers promised not to strike because they believe the opposition party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This is a flawed assumption because there could be other reasons why the workers promised not to strike.
C: This argument assumes that the only reason why the stock price did not increase was because the company failed to sell its subsidiaries. This is a flawed assumption because there could have been other reasons why the stock price did not increase.
D: This argument assumes that the only reason why the residents showed support for the rebels was because the rebels won the battle and freed the jailed leaders. This is a flawed assumption because there could have been other reasons why the residents showed support for the rebels.
E: This argument assumes that the only reason why the station's ratings decreased was because the new weather forecasting equipment was no improvement on the old. This is a flawed assumption because there could have been other reasons why the ratings decreased.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument suggests that because the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were flawed.

  A: The argument suggests that because the architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay. This is a flawed reasoning of causality.
  B: The argument suggests that because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This is a flawed reasoning of causality.
  C: The argument suggests that because the price of the stock did not increase in two years, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This is a flawed reasoning of causality.
  D: The argument suggests that because residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days, the rebels must have won the battle. This is a flawed reasoning of causality.
  E: The argument suggests that because the station's ratings actually decreased, the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This is a flawed reasoning of causality.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument in the given context assumes that the party's economic theories were the only possible cause of the inflation rate. It ignores other factors that could have led to the increase in inflation rate. 
A: The argument assumes that the only possible cause of changes in the valley's architecture is invasion or climatic change. It ignores other factors that could have led to changes in the architecture.
B: The argument assumes that the only reason workers will not strike is that they do not believe the party will keep its promise of a wage cut. It ignores other reasons why workers may not strike.

A: The argument presents a cause-and-effect relationship that is not necessarily true. The valley people's architecture remaining the same does not necessarily mean they were not invaded.
B: The argument presents a cause-and-effect relationship that is not necessarily true. The workers' promise not to strike does not necessarily mean they do not fear a wage cut.
C: The argument presents a cause-and-effect relationship that is not necessarily true. The stock price not increasing does not necessarily mean the company failed to sell its subsidiaries.
D: The argument presents a cause-and-effect relationship that is not necessarily true. The residents showing support for the rebels does not necessarily mean the rebels won the battle.

Knowledge: 
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries since some of the duties of cabinet secretaries should only be performed by citizens.
  The official also argues that since cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable, it is important that they should be citizens.
  
Analysis: 
  The logical completion of the official's argument would be a statement that reinforces the argument that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries, or that they should be appointed only if they become citizens. 

Action: Answer("D") 

Answer Explanation: 
  The most logical completion of the official's statement is that foreign citizens should not be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries. This is because cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Therefore, the best answer is D: "foreign citizens should not be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries."
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The government official argues that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries, because some duties of cabinet secretaries should be performed only by citizens. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. 
  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the government official.
  B: This choice contradicts the argument made by the government official, who states that foreign citizens can serve at most levels.
  C: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the government official.
  D: This choice contradicts the argument made by the government official, who argues that some duties of cabinet secretaries should be performed only by citizens.
  E: This choice contradicts the argument made by the government official, who states that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because they perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  Cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  If cabinet undersecretaries are foreign citizens, then they would be unable to perform the duties of the cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. Since the official argues that no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform, it follows logically that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries. Therefore, the statement that most logically completes the government official's argument is "foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries."

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.

Context: Dried parsley should never be used in cooking, for it is far less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley is.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most clearly helps to justify the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
  B: Only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used in cooking.
  C: Ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful.
  D: Parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking.
  E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
The argument in the context is that dried parsley is inferior to fresh parsley in terms of taste and healthfulness. The principle that justifies this argument is that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients in cooking. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is E. 

Option A is too broad and does not specifically address the issue of dried parsley. Option B is incorrect because tastiness is not the only consideration in cooking. Option C is too extreme and not necessarily true. Option D is too narrow and does not consider the possibility of other ingredients being used in combination with parsley.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that dried parsley is far less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  A: This principle is too broad and does not directly address the argument made in the passage.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.

  D: This does not weaken the detective's argument, as the report was released before the crime took place and does not provide evidence that an accountant was the embezzler.
  E: This weakens the detective's argument because if certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, then it is less likely that an actuary could have embezzled from the company.

Explanation: 
  The curator's statements provide information about the museum's collection and the prints available in the museum store. The only statement that must be true based on this information is that every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. This is because the museum only displays twentieth-century works, and prints of all the museum's permanent collection works are available in the store. Additionally, the store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks, which is also a twentieth-century work. However, there is no information to support any of the other statements.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The student's argument is based on the premise that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. However, this premise is flawed because it does not necessarily follow that exposure without symptoms implies immunity.
  A: This argument is flawed because it contains a fallacy of equivocation, where the term "just" is used in two different senses.
  B: This argument is flawed because it contains a fallacy of composition, where the characteristics of the parts are attributed to the whole.
  C: This argument is flawed because it contains a false dilemma, where only two options are presented as if they are the only possibilities.
  D: This argument is flawed because it contains a post hoc fallacy, where a correlation is assumed to imply causation.
  E: This argument is flawed because it contains a hasty generalization, where a conclusion is drawn from insufficient evidence.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to the microorganism. This assumption is not necessarily true, as some people may have other factors that prevent the development of symptoms. 
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors washing their hands less often than other health care professionals means that handwashing is not effective in preventing disease, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to a microorganism without harmful symptoms means that the person has immunity to that microorganism, which is not necessarily true.
A: This argument is flawed because it confuses the meaning of two different concepts (moral rightness and serving the interests of everyone).
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that business owners' willingness to expand their businesses is solely based on taxation, which is not necessarily true.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors' hand washing habits are the only factor in preventing disease, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The student's argument is based on the premise that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, which is not enough evidence to conclude that they have immunity to the microorganism.
  A: This argument is flawed because it confuses moral rightness with what serves the interests of everyone.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is based on an assumption that exposure to a microorganism without developing symptoms means that a person has immunity to that microorganism, which is not necessarily true.
  A: This argument talks about moral rightness and serving the interests of everyone, which is different from the student's argument about immunity to microorganisms.
  B: This argument talks about advertisers and writers of fiction, which is different from the student's argument about immunity to microorganisms.
  C: This argument talks about Isabel's medication, which is different from the student's argument about immunity to microorganisms.
  D: This argument talks about excessive taxation and business expansions, which is different from the student's argument about immunity to microorganisms.
  E: This argument talks about the value of handwashing in preventing disease, which is different from the student's argument about immunity to microorganisms.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician who criticized the book is employed by the company that manufactures that drug and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
  A: This option is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
  B: This option is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument. The journalist assumes that the physician is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of the drug because of his association with the company that manufactures the drug. However, this assumption may not be true in all cases.
  C: This option is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
  D: This option is not a criticism of the journalist's argument. It is a possibility that the journalist's argument fails to address, but it does not undermine the journalist's argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

  A: This choice is irrelevant to the study's findings as it talks about the amount of typing done by workers with different levels of control over their own work, but not about the relationship between control and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  B: This choice provides a possible explanation for the relationship between control and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as it suggests that emotional stress caused by feeling a lack of control over one's own work makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: This choice is irrelevant to the study's findings as it talks about the keyboards used by office workers, but not about the relationship between control and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This choice is irrelevant to the study's findings as it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards, but the study is focused on workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  E: This choice is irrelevant to the study's findings as it talks about repetitive motions other than typing, but the study is focused on the relationship between control and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome among office workers who do similar amounts of typing.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

A: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is focused on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones and does not make any comparison with modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision and how it was affected by the structure of its neck bones.
C: The argument does not discuss anything about the blood supply to Diplodocus's brain.
D: The argument does not make any assumptions about Diplodocus's ability to access high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is required by the argument as the argument presents that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not mention anything about Diplodocus's ability to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument discusses the feeding habits of Diplodocus and how its neck structure suggests that it fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. The argument also mentions computer models as a source of evidence.
A: The argument does not require this assumption, as it does not discuss modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not discuss Diplodocus's vision or the angle of its head.
C: The argument does not discuss Diplodocus's brain or blood supply.
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is not required, as the argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. The argument also states that Diplodocus's neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing the dinosaur to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: This statement is not required by the argument. 
B: This statement is not required by the argument.
C: This statement is not required by the argument.
D: This statement is not required by the argument.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The argument is about the feeding habits of Diplodocus, a dinosaur with a long neck. The computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. However, the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

Analysis:
The question asks for an assumption required by the argument. An assumption is something that is taken for granted or accepted as true without proof.

A: The argument does not depend on the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals, so this is not an assumption required by the argument.
B: The argument does not mention anything about the ability of Diplodocus to see in front of itself, so this is not an assumption required by the argument.
C: The argument does not depend on the blood supply to the brain of Diplodocus, so this is not an assumption required by the argument.
D: This is a possible alternative way for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation, but the argument does not depend on this assumption.
E: This is a possible alternative way for Diplodocus to browse for underwater vegetation, but the argument does not depend on this assumption.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones and how they would have prevented the dinosaur from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation. Instead, the neck could bend downward and extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. The conclusion is that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
 
A: This is not relevant to the argument.
B: This is not relevant to the argument.
C: This is not relevant to the argument.
D: This is not necessary, as the argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument relies on personal anecdotes and experiences, which is a small and potentially biased sample size, to refute the official results of the national referendum. The fact that everyone the person knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw in the reasoning. Choices B, C, D, and E do not accurately describe the flaw in the reasoning.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument is flawed because it uses evidence drawn from a small and biased sample (the people the speaker knows) to make a claim about the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument is based on a false premise and cannot be considered valid. Answer A is the best choice because it accurately describes this flaw in the reasoning. Answer B is incorrect because the argument does not presume the truth of the conclusion, but rather attempts to prove it with inadequate evidence. Answer C is incorrect because the argument does not reject a claim, but rather makes a claim that is not supported by the evidence. Answer D is incorrect because the argument does not fail to make a needed distinction, but rather fails to provide any evidence to support its claim. Answer E is incorrect because the argument does not defend a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it, but rather makes a claim based on inadequate evidence.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument is based on anecdotal evidence, which is not a reliable way to determine the outcome of a national referendum. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses anecdotal evidence (everyone I know voted against the proposal) to claim that the official results must be rigged. This is a hasty generalization and a logical fallacy. The fact that the people the author knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The argument also fails to consider the possibility that the author's social circle is not representative of the general population. Therefore, the most accurate description of the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the person knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The sample of people the person knows may not be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument's conclusion that the official results must be rigged is flawed.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument relies on anecdotal evidence, which is not representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal is not evidence that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The argument claims that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal, but this sample is unlikely to be representative of the entire population. The official results of the referendum, on the other hand, provide a more reliable indication of how the population as a whole voted. Therefore, the argument's conclusion that the results must be rigged is not supported by the evidence presented.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses a sample of people that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Just because the people the speaker knows voted against the proposal, it does not mean that most people voted against it. The speaker is making a hasty generalization based on a small and biased sample. Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning is that the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument relies on anecdotal evidence, which is based on a small and unrepresentative sample of people. Just because the people the arguer knows voted a certain way does not mean that everyone voted the same way. The official results of the referendum indicate that 80 percent of voters voted in favor of the proposal, which is strong evidence that the majority of people voted for it. Therefore, the argument's conclusion is not supported by reliable evidence. Choice A describes this flaw in the argument's reasoning.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted a certain way does not necessarily mean that most people voted that way. The sample size is too small and the people the speaker knows may not be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument commits the fallacy of hasty generalization.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Inez: The book we are reading, The Nature of Matter, is mistitled. A title should summarize the content of the whole book, but nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy. Antonio: I do not think that the author erred; according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the conversation above?
Choices:
  A: Inez believes that the book should be called The Nature of Energy.
  B: Antonio believes that there are no differences between matter and energy.
  C: Inez and Antonio disagree on whether matter and energy are related.
  D: Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book.
  E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez believes that the book's title is not appropriate because it does not summarize the content of the whole book.
  Inez thinks that nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing energy, a subject closely related to matter.
  Antonio thinks that the author did not err because modern physics views matter and energy as two facets of the same phenomenon.
  
Reasoning:
  Inez thinks that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, which is in line with her belief that the book is mistitled. 
  Antonio's statement that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon does not necessarily mean that he thinks there are no differences between them, so option B can be eliminated.
  Inez and Antonio do not disagree on whether matter and energy are related, so option C is incorrect.
  There is no indication in the conversation that Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book, so option D can also be eliminated.
  
Therefore, the most strongly supported option is E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez believes that the book's title is mistitled because it does not mention energy, which is closely related to matter.
  Antonio believes that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon, which implies that they are closely related.
  
Reasoning: 
  Inez and Antonio both agree that matter and energy are closely related. However, Inez believes that the title of the book should reflect this relationship by mentioning both matter and energy. Therefore, the best-supported statement is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. 
Choice A is not supported because Inez does not suggest a specific alternative title. 
Choice B is not supported because Antonio does not suggest that there are no differences between matter and energy. 
Choice C is not supported because both Inez and Antonio agree that matter and energy are related. 
Choice D is not supported because there is no indication that Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
- Inez argues that the book's title is mistitled because it discusses energy as well as matter.
- Antonio disagrees and argues that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

In the conversation, Inez argues that the book's title is mistitled because it discusses energy as well as matter. Antonio disagrees with Inez's argument, but his disagreement is not about whether matter and energy are related. Therefore, we can eliminate choices B and C. Additionally, there is no indication that Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book, so we can eliminate choice D. Choice A is incorrect because Inez does not explicitly suggest that the book should be called "The Nature of Energy." However, she does argue that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, which is captured in choice E. Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
Inez argues that the book's title is mistitled because it does not mention energy, which is a significant component of the book. Antonio disagrees, stating that matter and energy are related. Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, which is option E.
Response 4:

Knowledge:
- Inez thinks that the book's title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book.
- Inez thinks that nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy.
- Antonio thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning:
Inez thinks that the book's title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book and that nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy. Antonio thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Therefore, Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Hence, the most strongly supported option is E. 

Answer: E

Knowledge: 
  Inez believes that the book's title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book.
  Antonio thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
  
Reasoning:
  Inez thinks that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, because nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing energy. This is the most strongly supported by the conversation above, as Antonio's comment does not contradict this statement. Therefore, options A, B, C, and D are incorrect.
  
Therefore, the answer is E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
Inez argues that the book is mistitled because it does not mention energy, which is a closely related subject that occupies nearly half of the book. Antonio disagrees and argues that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. This is best captured by choice E.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:

  Inez thinks that nearly half of the book discusses a different, albeit closely related subject: energy.
  Antonio thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning:
  Inez thinks that the book should be titled in a way that does not mention matter without mentioning energy. She thinks that the current title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book. 
  Antonio thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. This does not necessarily mean that he thinks that the book's title is appropriate or that he disagrees with Inez's statement about the title.

Therefore, the most strongly supported option is E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
- Inez believes that the book is mistitled because it does not fully reflect the book's content.
- Antonio believes that matter and energy are closely related according to modern physics.

Explanation:
The conversation is mainly about the book's title and its content. Inez argues that the book's title is misleading because it does not fully reflect the content of the book, which includes a significant discussion of energy. Antonio, on the other hand, believes that the book's title is appropriate because matter and energy are closely related concepts. Therefore, the most strongly supported statement by the conversation is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Choice A is incorrect because Inez does not suggest a specific alternative title for the book. Choice B is incorrect because Antonio acknowledges that matter and energy are related but does not suggest that they are the same thing. Choice C is incorrect because Inez and Antonio do not disagree on the relationship between matter and energy. Choice D is incorrect because the conversation does not provide any indication that Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. So, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine?
Choices:
  A: All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water.
  B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
  C: A washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine.
  D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
  E: Washers that use more water get clothes cleaner than those that use less.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the consumer magazine claims that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers and that a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine.

Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent. This is because ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument made in the consumer magazine.
  B: This statement is not required by the argument in the consumer magazine, as the article is not discussing the solubility of detergents in top-loading washers.
  C: This statement is not required by the argument in the consumer magazine, as the article is only discussing the use of front-loading washers.
  D: This statement is required by the argument in the consumer magazine, as it supports the claim that ordinary powder detergent does not get clothes really clean in a front-loading washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
  E: This statement is not required by the argument in the consumer magazine, as the article is not discussing the effectiveness of washers that use more or less water.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
A: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above. If Joe made a legitimate offer to Sandy and Sandy has not rejected the offer, then there was a valid contract.
B: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above. If Gus made the offer in jest and Kenta was unaware of this, then the contract was not valid.
C: This argument does not apply the principle stated above. The fact that Frank's offer was legitimate does not mean that Mindy is obliged to accept it.
D: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above. If Hai's offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, then they have a valid contract if Lea accepts the offer.
E: This argument is not valid because it does not consider whether the offer made by Sal was legitimate or not.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The principle stated above is about the legitimacy of an offer.
  A: This argument talks about the validity of a contract based on a legitimate offer and acceptance. However, it does not specifically address the issue of whether the offer was made in jest.
  B: This argument talks about an offer that was made in jest, which would not be a legitimate offer. Therefore, this argument is consistent with the principle stated above.
  C: This argument talks about a legitimate offer, but it does not address the issue of whether the offer was made in jest.
  D: This argument talks about an offer that was not made in jest, which would be a legitimate offer. Therefore, this argument is consistent with the principle stated above.
  E: This argument talks about an offer that was not legitimate, but it does not specifically address the issue of whether the offer was made in jest.

A: This argument is valid, but it does not justify the reasoning in the principle stated above.
B: This argument is valid and it justifies the reasoning in the principle stated above.
C: This argument is not valid, as the principle stated above does not state that a reasonable person must accept a legitimate offer.
D: This argument is valid, but it does not justify the reasoning in the principle stated above.
E: This argument is not valid, as it does not address the issue of whether an offer is legitimate or not.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The principle stated in the context most helps to justify the reasoning in option B, which states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus made the offer in jest. Since an offer made in jest is not legitimate, there was no valid contract between Gus and Kenta.
Response 4:
Knowledge: The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
A: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above to justify the validity of the contract.
B: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above to justify the invalidity of the contract.
C: This argument does not take into account the principle stated above and is therefore irrelevant.
D: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above to justify the validity of the contract.
E: This argument is irrelevant since it is not clear whether the offer was legitimate or not.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Legitimate offer is an offer that is serious and reasonable.
  
Analysis:
  A: This argument is not justified by the principle stated above because it does not address the issue of whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  B: This argument is justified by the principle stated above because it shows that the offer was not legitimate and the contract was not valid.
  C: This argument is not justified by the principle stated above because it assumes that if the offer was legitimate, then Mindy would accept it, which is not necessarily true.
  D: This argument is justified by the principle stated above because it shows that the offer was made in such a way that it would be considered legitimate, and if Lea accepts it, they have a valid contract.
  E: This argument is not justified by the principle stated above because it does not address the issue of whether the offer was legitimate or not.

Action: Answer("B")

However, the passage does not suggest that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature, that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed, that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views, or that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. 
  Both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  The passage does not state that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  The passage does not state that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  The passage states that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, but it does not state that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  The passage states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, but it does not state that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  The passage does not state that stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Whether or not one can rightfully call a person's faithfulness a virtue depends in part on the object of that personas faithfulness. Virtues are by definition praiseworthy, which is why no one considers resentment virtuous, even though it is in fact a kind of faithfulness-faithfulness to hatreds or animosities.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous.
  B: Virtuous behavior is praiseworthy by definition.
  C: Behavior that emerges from hatred or animosity cannot be called virtuous.
  D: Faithfulness and resentment are obviously different, despite some similarities.
  E: Resentment should not be considered a virtuous emotion.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses the relationship between faithfulness and virtue, and how the object of faithfulness determines whether it is virtuous or not. Therefore, the most accurate conclusion that can be drawn is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. This is expressed in choice A. Choice B is too general, and choice C is too specific. Choice D is true but not the overall conclusion of the argument. Choice E is related, but not the overall conclusion of the argument.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument is about how the object of a person's faithfulness affects whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. The author explains that virtues are praiseworthy and that resentment, while a kind of faithfulness, is not virtuous because it is faithfulness to something negative. Therefore, the overall conclusion is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge:
The passage discusses how faithfulness can be considered a virtue, but only if the object of that faithfulness is praiseworthy. It also mentions that resentment, despite being a kind of faithfulness, is not considered virtuous.

A: This choice accurately summarizes the main point of the argument, which is that the object of a person's faithfulness affects whether or not that faithfulness is considered virtuous.
B: This choice is too broad. While the passage does mention that virtuous behavior is praiseworthy, this is not the main point of the argument.
C: This choice is too extreme. The passage does not say that all behavior that emerges from hatred or animosity is not virtuous, only that faithfulness to these emotions is not virtuous.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument. While the passage mentions that faithfulness and resentment are similar in some ways, this is not the main point of the argument.
E: This choice is too narrow. While the passage does say that resentment is not considered virtuous, this is not the main point of the argument.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. It also gives an example of resentment, which is not considered virtuous because it is faithfulness to hatreds or animosities. Therefore, the overall conclusion drawn in the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A accurately expresses this conclusion. Choice B is too general and does not capture the argument's main point. Choice C is too specific and only applies to resentment. Choice D is incorrect because the argument is not discussing the differences between faithfulness and resentment. Choice E is a specific example used in the argument, but it does not capture the overall conclusion.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness determines whether or not that faithfulness can be considered virtuous. The author provides the example of resentment, which is a type of faithfulness but is not considered virtuous. Therefore, the overall conclusion drawn in the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. This is most accurately expressed in choice A.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses the relationship between faithfulness and virtues. It argues that faithfulness can be virtuous or not depending on the object of that faithfulness. The author also explains that virtues are praiseworthy and that resentment is not considered virtuous, even though it is a kind of faithfulness. Therefore, the overall conclusion drawn in the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. This is best expressed in choice A.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses whether or not faithfulness can be considered a virtue. It concludes that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Therefore, the most accurate expression of the overall conclusion drawn in the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A best reflects this conclusion.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness determines its virtuousness, and how resentment, despite being a kind of faithfulness, is not considered virtuous. The overall conclusion drawn from this is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 

Option B is too broad as it doesn't cover the full scope of the argument. Option C is incorrect because it only discusses resentment, not faithfulness in general. Option D is incorrect because it only discusses the differences between two concepts, not the virtuousness of faithfulness. Option E is incorrect because it only discusses resentment, not faithfulness in general.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
- The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness determines whether it is virtuous or not.
- It also mentions that virtues are praiseworthy and that resentment is not considered virtuous despite being a kind of faithfulness.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness determines whether that faithfulness is virtuous or not. It also mentions that virtues are praiseworthy and that resentment is not considered virtuous, despite being a kind of faithfulness.

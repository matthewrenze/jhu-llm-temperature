### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study compares Sparkle Cola to five competing colas based on blindfolded volunteers' taste preferences.
  A: The study already divided the volunteers into five groups, each tasted a different cola, and most preferred Sparkle Cola. Therefore, this choice does not criticize the advertisement's reasoning.
  B: The study did not mention anything about the price or purchase preference of the volunteers. Therefore, this choice does not criticize the advertisement's reasoning.
  C: The study only compares Sparkle Cola to five competing colas, and the advertisement does not claim that Sparkle Cola is the best cola in the world. Therefore, this choice does not criticize the advertisement's reasoning.
  D: The advertisement does not specify the reason for the volunteers' preference. Therefore, this choice does not criticize the advertisement's reasoning.
  E: The study only compares colas, and the advertisement does not claim that Sparkle Cola is the best beverage in the world. Therefore, this choice does not criticize the advertisement's reasoning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The advertisement is claiming that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested. The claim is based on a study in which blindfolded volunteers were divided into five groups, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.

A: This is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement. The study did divide the volunteers into five smaller groups and reported the results of each group.

B: This is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement. The study did not make any assumptions about whether the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola or any other cola.

C: This is a possible criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement. The study only tested five competing colas, and it is possible that another cola not tested would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.

D: This is a possible criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement. The study did not control for factors such as packaging or price that may have influenced the volunteers' preferences.

E: This is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement. The study only tested colas, and the advertisement is only claiming that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than any of the competing colas tested.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that in a study, blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  A: This choice criticizes the generalization made by the advertisement by pointing out that the preference may not be true for each of the five smaller groups. However, the advertisement does not mention the size of the groups, so this criticism is not applicable.
  B: This choice criticizes the advertisement for assuming that the preference for Sparkle Cola will translate into actual purchases. However, this is not mentioned in the advertisement.
  C: This choice criticizes the advertisement for overlooking the possibility that another untested cola may be preferred over Sparkle Cola. This is a valid criticism of the study.
  D: This choice criticizes the advertisement for overlooking other reasons why people may prefer Sparkle Cola over other colas. This is a valid criticism of the study.
  E: This choice criticizes the advertisement for only testing colas and not other beverages. However, this is not a valid criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to one of five competing colas tasted.
  A: This answer choice criticizes the study design by suggesting that the generalization may not be true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: This answer choice criticizes the assumption that the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola over the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: This answer choice criticizes the study design by suggesting that some cola not tested in the study may have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This answer choice criticizes the study design by suggesting that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as packaging or price, rather than taste.
  E: This answer choice criticizes the study design by suggesting that the study does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested, based on a study that blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  A: This is not a vulnerability of the reasoning in the advertisement.
  B: This is not a vulnerability of the reasoning in the advertisement.
  C: This is a vulnerability of the reasoning in the advertisement, as it overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This is not a vulnerability of the reasoning in the advertisement, as the advertisement is only claiming that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than the competing colas tested, not all colas in general.
  E: This is not a vulnerability of the reasoning in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five competing colas.
  A: This choice criticizes the generalization that the study made about the preference of Sparkle Cola by the entire group, but it does not directly criticize the reasoning in the advertisement.
  B: This choice criticizes the assumption that the volunteers would choose Sparkle Cola over other colas outside the study, but it does not directly criticize the reasoning in the advertisement.
  C: This choice criticizes the possibility that a cola not tested in the study would have been preferred by the volunteers, but it does not directly criticize the reasoning in the advertisement.
  D: This choice criticizes the possibility that factors other than taste may have influenced the preference of Sparkle Cola, which directly criticizes the reasoning in the advertisement.
  E: This choice criticizes the limited scope of the study, but it does not directly criticize the reasoning in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested. 
  A: This choice criticizes the generalization made by the advertisement, stating that it may not be true for each of the five smaller groups. This is a valid criticism.
  B: This choice is not relevant to the reasoning presented in the advertisement.
  C: This choice suggests that there could be a cola that is not tested in the study that could elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. This is a valid criticism.
  D: This choice suggests that people may prefer Sparkle Cola for reasons other than its taste, such as packaging or price. This is a valid criticism.
  E: This choice is not relevant to the reasoning presented in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement presents a study where blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, and most of them preferred Sparkle Cola.
  A: This choice criticizes the generalization made from the study, suggesting that it may not apply to each of the five smaller groups.
  B: This choice criticizes the assumption that the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola instead of other colas tasted, assuming that the price of Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: This choice criticizes the study's limitation of not testing other colas, suggesting that a cola not tested may have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This choice criticizes the study's limitation of not considering other factors that may influence consumers' preferences, such as packaging or price.
  E: This choice criticizes the study's limitation of not considering non-cola beverages, suggesting that the results may not apply to other types of drinks.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement is based on a controlled study in which blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
A: This choice criticizes the advertisement by pointing out that the study may not be representative of the entire group of volunteers, but it does not address the reasoning used in the advertisement.
B: This choice criticizes the advertisement by assuming that the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola, but the advertisement does not make this assumption.
C: This choice criticizes the advertisement by pointing out that there may be other colas that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola, but it does not address the reasoning used in the advertisement.
D: This choice criticizes the advertisement by pointing out that there may be reasons other than taste that would make people prefer Sparkle Cola, but it does not address the reasoning used in the advertisement.
E: This choice criticizes the advertisement by pointing out that the study only elicits responses to colas, but it does not address the reasoning used in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  The advertisement bases this claim on a study conducted on blindfolded volunteers who were divided into five groups and tasted Sparkle Cola and one of the five competing colas.

A: This is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement because the advertisement acknowledges that the volunteers were divided into five smaller groups, and that each group tasted a different cola. 

B: The advertisement does not assume that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive. Therefore, this is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.

C: The advertisement does not overlook the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. Therefore, this is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.

D: This is a possible criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement because the advertisement does not consider the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.

E: This is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement because the study was only concerned with colas.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the context presents a cause-and-effect relationship that is flawed because it assumes that the absence of a protective cover is the only reason why squirrels eat from a bird feeder. 
  A: The argument presents a valid cause-and-effect relationship and does not have the same flaw as the argument in the context.
  B: The argument presents a valid cause-and-effect relationship and does not have the same flaw as the argument in the context.
  C: The argument presents a valid cause-and-effect relationship and does not have the same flaw as the argument in the context.
  D: The argument presents a cause-and-effect relationship, but it assumes that neglecting to check tire pressure is the only reason why tire pressure becomes too low. This is a similar flaw as the argument in the context.
  E: The argument presents a valid cause-and-effect relationship, but it introduces an additional cause that may also lead to the effect. This is not a similar flaw as the argument in the context.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument above presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as affirming the consequent. This pattern of reasoning occurs when an argument mistakenly assumes that if the consequent (the second part of a conditional statement) is true, then the antecedent (the first part of a conditional statement) must also be true. 
A: This argument does not exhibit the flawed pattern of reasoning known as affirming the consequent. 
B: This argument exhibits the flawed pattern of reasoning known as affirming the consequent.
C: This argument does not exhibit the flawed pattern of reasoning known as affirming the consequent. 
D: This argument exhibits the flawed pattern of reasoning known as affirming the consequent.
E: This argument does not exhibit the flawed pattern of reasoning known as affirming the consequent. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument above presents a conditional statement: If a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, squirrels will eat from it, and if squirrels eat from it, it will not attract many birds.
  The conclusion drawn is: A bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  A: This argument presents a conditional statement: If a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely. The conclusion drawn is that a car owner should check the tire pressure regularly.
  B: This argument presents a conditional statement: If a car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely. The conclusion drawn is that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: This argument presents a conditional statement: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. The conclusion drawn is that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: This argument presents a conditional statement: If the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely. The conclusion drawn is that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  E: This argument presents a conditional statement: A tire will wear out prematurely if its pressure is too low or if it is often driven on gravel roads. The conclusion drawn is that keeping the tire pressure from becoming too low will not help a tire last longer if it is often driven on gravel roads.
  
Flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above: The argument presents a conditional statement and concludes that the consequent will not happen if the antecedent does not happen, without considering other possible factors that may affect the consequent.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above uses a flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent. This is when we assume that if A then B, and we observe B, then A must have occurred. However, this is not necessarily true, as there may be other reasons why B occurred. 
  A: This argument does not use affirming the consequent. It presents a valid conditional statement, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.
  B: This argument uses affirming the consequent. It assumes that if A then B, and we observe B, then A must have occurred. However, this is not necessarily true, as there may be other reasons why B occurred.
  C: This argument does not use affirming the consequent. It presents a valid conditional statement, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.
  D: This argument uses affirming the consequent. It assumes that if A then B, and we observe B, then A must have occurred. However, this is not necessarily true, as there may be other reasons why B occurred.
  E: This argument presents a different kind of flaw, called a false dilemma. It presents only two options (low tire pressure or gravel roads) when there may be other reasons why the tire wears out prematurely.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument above presents a flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent. It assumes that if a condition (squirrels eating from a bird feeder) is present, the consequence (the bird feeder will not attract many birds) must also be present. However, this is not necessarily true, as there may be other reasons why a bird feeder does not attract many birds.
A: This argument does not use the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above.
B: This argument uses a similar flawed pattern of reasoning to the argument above, as it assumes that if a condition (neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly) is present, the consequence (the tire will wear out prematurely) must also be present.
C: This argument does not use the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above.
D: This argument uses a similar flawed pattern of reasoning to the argument above, as it assumes that if a condition (neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly) is present, the consequence (the tire will wear out prematurely) must also be present.
E: This argument does not use the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a conditional statement: if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, then squirrels eat from it.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds.
  The argument assumes that the presence of squirrels will deter birds from using the feeder.
  A: This argument presents a conditional statement and a conclusion based on that statement, but it does not assume anything about an intermediate cause (like the squirrels in the original argument).
  B: This argument presents a conditional statement and an intermediate cause (neglecting to check the tire pressure), but it does not assume anything about a third factor that could affect the conclusion.
  C: This argument presents a claim about causation and a proposed solution to a problem, but it does not assume anything about a third factor that could affect the conclusion.
  D: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it presents a conditional statement and an intermediate cause, and it concludes that a certain outcome will occur. However, it does not assume anything about a third factor that could affect the conclusion.
  E: This argument presents a conditional statement and an intermediate cause, and it introduces a third factor that could affect the conclusion. However, it does not assume that the third factor will necessarily negate the effect of the intermediate cause.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the context involves a conditional statement and an "only if" statement, but it confuses the necessary and sufficient conditions.
  A: The argument in option A involves a conditional statement and a "likely cause" statement, but it does not confuse the necessary and sufficient conditions.
  B: The argument in option B involves a conditional statement and a "only if" statement, but it correctly identifies the necessary and sufficient conditions.
  C: The argument in option C involves a conditional statement and an "unless" statement, but it does not confuse the necessary and sufficient conditions.
  D: The argument in option D involves a conditional statement and a "therefore" statement, but it correctly identifies the necessary and sufficient conditions.
  E: The argument in option E involves a conditional statement and an "also" statement, but it is not similar to the argument in the context.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the only reason why a bird feeder would not attract many birds is because it lacks a protective cover, when in reality there could be other reasons as well.
  A: This argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above.
  B: This argument has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above, in that it assumes that the only reason why a tire would wear out prematurely is because the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly, when in reality there could be other reasons as well.
  C: This argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above.
  D: This argument has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above, in that it assumes that the only reason why a tire would wear out prematurely is because the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly, when in reality there could be other reasons as well.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. It also states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not watch that much television.
  A: This statement does not address the argument and does not weaken it.
  B: This statement contradicts the argument. If a person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television, then it is not true that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  C: This statement supports the argument. If people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, then it suggests that people who watch more television are more likely to overestimate the risks.
  D: This statement weakens the argument. If people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, then it suggests that watching television is not the only factor that leads people to overestimate the risks.
  E: This statement does not address the argument and does not weaken it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that there is a correlation between watching an above-average amount of television and overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  
A: This statement does not necessarily weaken the argument, as it is possible that people who watch more television are still more likely to overestimate risks.
B: This statement also does not affect the argument, as it is possible that people who watch more television are still more likely to overestimate risks, regardless of where they live.
C: This statement actually supports the argument, as it suggests that people who watch less television are more accurate in their estimations of natural disaster risks.
D: This statement could potentially weaken the argument, as it suggests that people who are well informed about natural disaster risks do not rely on television for their information.
E: This statement does not affect the argument, as it is possible that people who watch more television are still more likely to overestimate risks, regardless of where they live.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument claims that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risk of natural disasters. We need to find an option that suggests that this is not the case or that there is no correlation between the two variables.
A: This option does not address the relationship between television watching and overestimating risks.
B: This option suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters. This does not provide any information about whether or not television watching is correlated with overestimating risks.
C: This option suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster. This strengthens the argument.
D: This option suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This weakens the argument.
E: This option suggests that people who live in an area that is prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch an above-average amount of television. This does not provide any information about whether or not television watching is correlated with overestimating risks.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  A: This statement does not address the relationship between television watching and the overestimation of natural disasters.
  B: This statement contradicts the argument by suggesting that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters.
  C: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of natural disasters.
  D: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well-informed about the risks of natural disasters tend to become informed in ways other than by watching television.
  E: This statement does not address the relationship between television watching and the overestimation of natural disasters.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them, and that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not.
  A: This statement does not address the argument and fails to weaken it.
  B: This statement contradicts the argument, suggesting that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters. This weakens the argument.
  C: This statement supports the argument, suggesting that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. This does not weaken the argument.
  D: This statement supports the argument, suggesting that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This does not weaken the argument.
  E: This statement does not address the argument and fails to weaken it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  
A: This statement doesn't weaken the argument. It is possible that many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, but this doesn't contradict the argument.
B: This statement doesn't weaken the argument. It is possible that a person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television, but this doesn't contradict the argument.
C: This statement strengthens the argument. If people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, then it suggests that watching too much television is what leads people to overestimate the risks.
D: This statement weakens the argument. If people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, then it suggests that watching television is not the only factor that leads people to overestimate the risks.
E: This statement doesn't weaken the argument. It is possible that a person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not, but this doesn't contradict the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
 The argument states that watching too much television leads people to overestimate the risks of being victims of natural disasters. It implies that if people watch less television, they will not overestimate the risks.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not address the effect of watching television on people's perception of natural disasters risk.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the effect of watching television on people's perception of natural disaster risk.
  C: This statement strengthens the argument because it shows that people who watch less television are more likely to have an accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of natural disasters.
  D: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well-informed about the risks of natural disasters may not have acquired their knowledge from watching television.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not address the effect of watching television on people's perception of natural disasters risk.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the study's sample size was small but the study's author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years. The biologist concludes that the critics of the study are wrong to doubt its results.
  A: The biologist doesn't make a claim that chameleons' behavior is generalizable to lizards as a whole, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The biologist's argument is not vulnerable to this criticism, as the argument explains that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  C: The biologist's argument may be criticized for focusing on the study's author rather than on the study itself, so this choice is relevant to the argument.
  D: The biologist's argument doesn't address the expertise of the study's critics, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
  E: The biologist's argument doesn't hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The argument implies that the study's author is trustworthy and that the study's results are reliable based on the author's reputation and previous work, rather than on the merits of the study itself. This is a fallacy known as an appeal to authority. The argument does not address the critics' concerns about the small sample size or explain how the study's conclusions were reached. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is E, which captures the flaw in the biologist's argument.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The biologist's argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The argument supports the study's conclusion based on the author's reputation for doing excellent work, while dismissing the critics' doubts about the study's results by pointing out that the author has been doing excellent work for years. This implies that the author's reputation alone is sufficient to validate the study's conclusion, which is not a sound argument. Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The argument implies that the study's author is trustworthy and has been doing excellent work for years, but does not provide any evidence or reasoning to refute the critics' argument that the sample size was very small. Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism for not addressing the critics' argument directly and for relying solely on the author's reputation. Choice (E) accurately describes this vulnerability.
Response 4:
The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument:
Knowledge: The argument states that the study's sample size was small but it is reliable because the author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument mentions that chameleons regulate their production of vitamin D by basking in the sun.
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the study's critics lack relevant expertise.
E: This answer choice accurately describes the argument's vulnerability to criticism. The argument holds the study's author to a higher standard than the study's critics.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The biologist's argument suggests that the study's conclusion is valid despite the small sample size because the author is an expert who has been doing excellent work for years. 
  A: The argument does not make this generalization. It only talks about chameleons.
  B: The argument mentions that chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
  C: The argument defends the study's conclusion by referring to the author's professional reputation, but it does not focus solely on the author.
  D: The argument does not address whether the critics have relevant expertise.
  E: The argument does not make any comparison between the author and the critics, so it does not hold them to different standards.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The biologist argues that the study's conclusion is valid despite the small sample size because the study's author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years. The study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.

A: The biologist does not claim that the behavior of chameleons is generalizable to lizards as a whole. The biologist only mentions chameleons in the argument.
B: The biologist does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun. The biologist states that the careful study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
C: The biologist does mention the study's author, but this is not the main focus of the argument. The biologist uses the author's reputation to support the validity of the study's conclusion.
D: The biologist does not make any claims about the expertise of the study's critics.
E: This is a possible criticism of the argument. The biologist may be holding the study's author to a higher standard than the study's critics.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
The biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument:
Knowledge: The argument states that "Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years."
A: This is not a vulnerability of the argument.
B: The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
C: This is not a vulnerability of the argument.
D: The argument does not demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise.
E: This choice is the most likely answer, as the argument holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The biologist concludes that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  The critics of the study pointed out that the sample size was very small.
  The author of the study has a good professional reputation.
  
A: The biologist does not claim that the behavior of chameleons is generalizable to all lizards, so this choice is not the correct answer.
B: The biologist does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun, so this choice is not the correct answer.
C: The biologist does not focus solely on the study's author, but rather uses the author's professional reputation as evidence to support the study's validity. Therefore this choice is not the correct answer.
D: The biologist does not fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise. Therefore this choice is not the correct answer.
E: The biologist does hold the study's author to a higher standard than the study's critics, by using the author's professional reputation as evidence to support the study's validity. Therefore, this choice is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D based on a study of six individual chameleons. 
  Critics of the study are wrong to doubt its results because the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  
A: The biologist does not take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole. The biologist only concludes that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
B: The biologist provides an explanation of how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
C: The biologist does mention the study's author, but only to argue that the author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years. The biologist also makes a clear argument based on the study's findings.
D: The biologist does not address the expertise of the study's critics.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors resulted in a substantial decrease in patient injuries caused by staff errors. It suggests that the staff was more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties because they knew their errors were being recorded.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the effect of the plan on the incidence of patient injuries.
  B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is not necessarily a result of the plan's implementation.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the effect of the plan on the incidence of patient injuries.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is a result of the plan's implementation and not due to some other factor.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the effect of the plan on the incidence of patient injuries.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the systematic recording of staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries since it made the staff more careful in carrying out their duties.
  
A: This statement does not provide information that strengthens the argument. The argument is about the effect of systematic recording, not the hospital's policy of investigating errors. 
B: This statement does not provide information that strengthens the argument. The argument is about the effect of systematic recording at the hospitals that implemented the plan.
C: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan did not cover all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was caused by the staff becoming more careful after they became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
E: This statement does not provide information that strengthens the argument. The argument is about the effect of systematic recording, not the punishment for staff errors.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors at several regional hospitals.
  A: The policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient is not directly related to the argument.
  B: The decrease in the incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan does not directly support the argument for the hospitals that did participate in the plan.
  C: The plan not calling for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not does not directly support the argument that the implementation of the plan reduced the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
  D: The information that the decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed supports the argument that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  E: The information that under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors does not directly support the argument that the implementation of the plan reduced the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan to record staff errors. The argument also suggests that the reason for the decrease is that staff members became more careful in carrying out their patient-care duties because they knew their errors were being monitored.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about a policy that was in place before the implementation of the plan.
  B: This statement is weak and does not provide any evidence that the staff errors were being monitored at the hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan may not have been as effective as claimed since some errors were not recorded.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was a direct result of staff members becoming more careful in carrying out their duties after they became aware that their errors were being monitored.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the implementation of the plan.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the systematic recording of staff errors led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  A: This policy is not relevant to the argument as it does not address the effectiveness of the plan.
  B: This fact is not relevant to the argument as it does not address the effectiveness of the plan.
  C: This fact is not relevant to the argument as it does not address the effectiveness of the plan.
  D: This answer choice directly supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was a result of staff becoming more careful after becoming aware of the monitoring.
  E: This policy is not relevant to the argument as it does not address the effectiveness of the plan.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
  A: This statement provides information about the hospitals' policies before the implementation of the plan, but it does not directly relate to the effectiveness of the plan or how it impacted the staff's behavior.
  B: This statement provides information about a hospital that did not participate in the plan, but it does not directly relate to the effectiveness of the plan or how it impacted the staff's behavior at hospitals that did participate in the plan.
  C: This statement implies that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries, which would weaken the argument.
  D: This statement suggests that the staff's awareness of the monitoring was a necessary factor in the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries, which strengthens the argument.
  E: This statement provides information about the consequences for staff members who made errors, but it does not directly relate to the effectiveness of the plan or how it impacted the staff's behavior.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - A plan was implemented to systematically record staff errors in several regional hospitals to reduce the number of patient injuries.
  - The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then, and the argument is that this is due to staff becoming more meticulous in carrying out their duties as they knew their errors were being monitored.
Choices:
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument as it talks about a policy that was already in place before the plan was implemented.
  B: This statement does not strengthen the argument as it talks about a different hospital, and it is not clear what caused the decrease in patient injuries.
  C: This statement weakens the argument as it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive enough to record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument as it suggests that the decrease in the incidence of injuries was due to staff becoming more meticulous as they knew their errors were being monitored.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument as it talks about the consequences of staff errors rather than the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors has led to a decrease in patient injuries at several regional hospitals.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument as it discusses a policy that was already in place before the implementation of the new plan.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument as it discusses a different hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  C: This statement, if true, would weaken the argument as it suggests that some errors were not recorded and therefore the decrease in injuries may not be attributed to the plan.
  D: This statement, if true, would strengthen the argument by suggesting that the decrease in injuries was a result of the staff becoming more careful due to the knowledge that their errors were being monitored.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument as it discusses the consequences of staff errors, rather than the implementation of the plan.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has decreased at the hospitals that implemented the plan to systematically record staff errors, and that this decrease is due to the knowledge that errors are being monitored.
A: The fact that the hospitals had a policy of investigating life-threatening errors before the plan was implemented is irrelevant to the argument.
B: The decrease in patient injuries at a hospital that did not participate in the plan weakens the argument that the plan was responsible for the decrease at the other hospitals.
C: If errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not were not recorded, this weakens the argument that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the knowledge that errors were being monitored.
D: If the decrease in patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being analyzed, this strengthens the argument that the decrease was due to the knowledge that errors were being monitored.
E: The fact that staff members received only reprimands for their first errors is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors resulted in a substantial decrease in the incidence of patient injuries at several regional hospitals. The argument also suggests that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
A: This statement provides information about a pre-existing policy that is not directly relevant to the argument.
B: This statement strengthens the counter-argument because it suggests that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries may not be due to the implementation of the plan, but to some other factor that affected all regional hospitals.
C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive enough to record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
D: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries was due to the staff becoming more careful in carrying out their patient-care duties after they became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the impact of the plan on the incidence of patient injuries.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: 
The CEO's argument is flawed because it generalizes too quickly from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. The CEO argues that the company is not being environmentally irresponsible because its current production methods pollute less than its old methods, and because there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. However, this argument fails to take into account the possibility that there may be other ways in which the company is being environmentally irresponsible, and that the specific criticism may not be representative of all possible criticisms. Therefore, the CEO's argument is flawed because it generalizes too quickly from a specific criticism to the entire class of criticisms.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

The CEO's argument assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, which is presumptuous since technological advances may lead to the development of new methods that are less polluting. Therefore, the CEO's argument takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. Choice A correctly identifies this flaw.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. The CEO assumes that there is no way to produce goods without any pollution, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument is flawed in assuming that there is no alternative to the current production methods.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. This is evident in the CEO's statement "there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution." The CEO is assuming that it is impossible to develop production methods that do not produce pollution, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument is flawed. Choice A accurately describes this flaw. Choice B is irrelevant to the argument. Choice C is not applicable to the argument. Choice D is not mentioned in the argument. Choice E is not necessarily true based on the information presented in the argument.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. The CEO assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, but it is possible that such methods could be developed in the future. Therefore, this argument commits the fallacy of assuming that something is true without providing any evidence to support that assumption.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

The CEO's argument is flawed because it assumes that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. This assumption is not necessarily true, and it is possible that the company could invest more resources into developing more environmentally friendly production methods. Therefore, the reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. Choice A accurately reflects this flaw.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The CEO argues that the company is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did. They also claim that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
A: The CEO does not take into consideration the possibility that production methods that do not produce pollution can be developed.
B: The CEO's argument does not discuss different causes having similar effects.
C: The CEO's argument is not generalizing hastily from a single criticism.
D: The CEO's argument does not take for granted that the company has successfully reduced the amount of pollution produced.
E: The CEO's argument is flawed because they assume that there are no current methods available that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it currently does.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. The CEO states that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution, but this assumption is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it assumes something is impossible without adequate evidence.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. This assumption is not necessarily true, and there may be methods that have not yet been discovered or developed. Therefore, the argument is flawed in its assumption and in its failure to consider alternative possibilities.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute less than their old methods did, and there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  A: This choice suggests that the CEO has taken for granted that there cannot be any production methods that do not produce pollution, but the CEO has not made this assumption in the argument.
  B: This choice suggests that the CEO has failed to consider that different causes can have similar effects, but the CEO has not made this assumption in the argument.
  C: This choice suggests that the CEO has generalized too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms, which is similar to the CEO's argument that the corporation is environmentally responsible because they have reduced pollution. However, this choice is not the best answer because the CEO's argument is not about a class of criticisms.
  D: This choice suggests that the CEO has taken for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded, but the CEO has not made this assumption in the argument.
  E: This choice correctly identifies the flaw in the CEO's reasoning. The CEO's argument assumes that there are no methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now, but this assumption is not necessarily true.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife. 
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that Figoria has as much right to govern its own resources as other countries.
A: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development. This information is not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. If this assumption is not true, then the construction of replacement wetland habitats would not protect wildlife.
C: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that in nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated. This information is not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife. If this assumption is not true, then the proposed regulation would not be effective in protecting wildlife.
E: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species. This information is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission is that to protect wildlife, future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. This would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.

A: The argument does not depend on this assumption. The argument is focused on wetland development only.
B: This assumption is critical to the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission. If the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will not survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, then the argument falls apart.
C: The argument does not address the agricultural nature of nations and therefore does not depend on this assumption.
D: This assumption supports the argument but is not critical to it. The argument is based on the need to protect wildlife and regulate wetland development.
E: The argument does not depend on this assumption. The argument is focused on wetland development only.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that to protect wildlife, the development of wetlands in Figoria must be regulated and future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.

The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that they have as much right to govern their own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.

A: The argument does not depend on the number of species endangered by the development of wetlands compared to other types of development.
B: This assumption is necessary for the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission, as their proposal is to offset future wetland development by constructing replacement wetland habitats. 
C: The argument is focused on wetland development in industrialized nations, so the assumption that wetland development in primarily agricultural nations does not need to be regulated is irrelevant.
D: This assumption supports the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not necessary for their proposal to be valid.
E: The argument does not depend on whether the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that to protect wildlife, future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
- The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
- The question asks for an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends.

A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the number of species endangered by the development of wetlands in comparison to other types of development. This option is not relevant to the argument.
B: This assumption is necessary for the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission. If species indigenous to natural wetland habitats cannot survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, the regulation of wetland development would not be effective in protecting wildlife.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is not about the need to regulate wetland development in nations that are primarily agricultural. This option is not relevant to the argument.
D: Although this option supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, it is not an assumption on which the argument depends.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is not about the severity of the threat to the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands. This option is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development should be regulated and offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development should be allowed since it is necessary for growth and Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.

A: The argument does not depend on the number of species endangered by wetland development compared to other types of development.
B: If replacement wetlands did not support indigenous species, the argument would not be effective.
C: The argument does not address the regulation of wetland development in primarily agricultural nations.
D: This assumption supports the argument but is not necessary for it to be effective.
E: The severity of the threat to the species in Figorian wetlands is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife, and is necessary for growth, and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
A: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
B: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands because the replacement wetlands will replace the original wetlands.
C: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that in nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
D: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife because the argument is based on the idea that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
E: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that the development of wetlands for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife, they propose to regulate such development in Figoria and offset it by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission opposes this proposition, arguing that other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife, and that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  The question asks for an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends.
  
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption. The argument is about the development of wetlands, not the endangerment of species.
B: This assumption is critical to the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission. Their proposal to regulate wetland development and offset it by constructing replacement wetland habitats depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is not about agricultural nations, so this assumption is not relevant.
D: This assumption supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not necessary for their argument. Their proposal can still be valid even if Figorian regulation of development has not protected and preserved wildlife in the past.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is not about specific species, but about the protection of wildlife in general. Therefore, this assumption is not necessary for their argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that to protect wildlife, wetland development must be regulated in Figoria, and future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and thus, it should be allowed. 
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
B: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, as the commission proposes to offset the wetland development with the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that in nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
D: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife, as it supports the idea that Figoria should regulate wetland development to protect wildlife.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is discussing a situation where the penalty for a certain type of pollution is severe, but there isn't enough evidence to be certain of the identity of the polluter. Therefore, the argument concludes that the penalty cannot be imposed.
  A: This principle is related to the argument, but it does not specifically address the issue of not having enough evidence to be certain of guilt.
  B: This principle discusses how severe the penalties should be for crimes, but it does not specifically address the issue of not having enough evidence to be certain of guilt.
  C: This principle talks about proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused, but it does not specifically address the issue of not having enough evidence to be certain of guilt.
  D: This principle is related to the argument, but it does not specifically address the issue of justifying the penalty in cases where there is not enough evidence to be certain of guilt.
  E: This principle is directly related to the argument, as it discusses the idea that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be justified without being certain of guilt.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing whether or not the penalty for pollution can be imposed on the local auto repair shop, and concludes that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
  A: This principle relates to the certainty needed to impose a penalty, which is relevant to the argument.
  B: This principle discusses the appropriate severity of penalties, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  C: This principle discusses the proportionality of penalties to the harm caused, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  D: This principle discusses a potential consequence of severe penalties, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  E: This principle discusses the appropriateness of severe penalties when guilt cannot be sufficiently certain, which is relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument is about identifying the responsible party for a pollution incident. The penalty for this type of pollution is severe, and the argument states that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.

A: This principle aligns with the reasoning in the argument. The argument states that the penalty is severe, and therefore, we must be more certain of the guilt of the polluter before imposing the penalty.
B: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
D: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
E: This principle contradicts the argument's reasoning. The argument states that the penalty is severe, and therefore, we need stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility to justify imposing the penalty.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument is about the difficulty of being certain of the identity of the polluter and the justification of imposing a severe penalty without strong evidence or admission of responsibility.
A: This principle is directly related to the argument and supports the reasoning that the penalty cannot be imposed without sufficient certainty.
B: This principle is not directly related to the argument and does not support the reasoning of the argument.
C: This principle is indirectly related to the argument, but it does not support the reasoning of the argument. 
D: This principle is not relevant to the argument and does not support the reasoning of the argument.
E: This principle is directly related to the argument and supports the reasoning that the penalty cannot be imposed without sufficient certainty.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter due to lack of sufficient evidence.
  A: This principle is directly related to the argument, stating that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing it.
  B: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it talks about the severity of penalties in general, rather than in relation to a specific offense.
  C: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it talks about the proportionality of penalties in general, rather than in relation to a specific offense.
  D: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it talks about the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense, rather than the evidence required to impose a penalty.
  E: This principle is similar to option A, but it is less specific to the argument, as it talks about punishment in general, rather than in relation to a specific offense.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing the difficulty in justifying the imposition of a severe penalty due to insufficient evidence of the identity of the polluter.
  A: This principle is directly related to the argument, stating that a severe penalty requires a higher level of certainty of guilt.
  B: This principle does not directly relate to the argument, as it discusses the appropriate level of severity for penalties, not the level of certainty required for imposing them.
  C: This principle is related to the argument, but it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt required to impose a penalty.
  D: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense, not the level of certainty required to impose a penalty.
  E: This principle is directly related to the argument, stating that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it requires a level of certainty of guilt that cannot be obtained.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument is discussing the difficulty of justifying a penalty for pollution without sufficient evidence to identify the perpetrator. The argument suggests that the penalty is severe and therefore requires stronger evidence or a confession to justify imposing it. 
A: This principle states that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party. This is directly in line with the reasoning in the argument, which suggests that the severity of the penalty requires stronger evidence or a confession to justify it.
B: This principle discusses the appropriate severity of penalties, but it does not directly address the issue of justifying a penalty without sufficient evidence.
C: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction. While this is a valid principle, it does not directly address the issue of justifying a penalty without sufficient evidence.
D: This principle suggests that severe penalties may discourage someone from admitting responsibility for an offense. While this is a valid principle, it does not directly address the issue of justifying a penalty without sufficient evidence.
E: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it is impossible to justify punishment. While this is a valid principle, it is less directly relevant to the issue at hand than principle A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty for pollution without sufficient evidence of the identity of the polluter.
A: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning that a severe penalty requires a higher level of certainty about guilt before it can be imposed.
B: This principle is not relevant to the argument's discussion of the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence.
C: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's discussion of the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence.
D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's discussion of the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence.
E: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning that a penalty cannot be so severe that it requires a level of certainty about guilt that cannot be met.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is about whether or not it is justified to impose the penalty for the pollution that entered the river. The reasoning of the argument is that the penalty is so severe that it requires stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility before being imposed. Choice A is the best principle that justifies this reasoning, as it states that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party. This principle supports the argument's claim that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed before imposing the penalty. Choice B is not relevant to the argument. Choice C is about the proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused, which is not the main concern of the argument. Choice D is about the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, which is not relevant to the argument. Choice E is similar to choice A, but it is not as strong, as it states that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment, which is not the case in this argument.
Response 9:
Knowledge: The argument is discussing the difficulty in justifying the imposition of a severe penalty on a party without sufficient evidence of their guilt. The argument implies that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the polluter admits responsibility, a severe penalty cannot be imposed. 
A: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning that a severe penalty requires a higher level of certainty of guilt. 
B: This principle discusses the appropriate level of severity for penalties, but does not address the issue of certainty required for imposing a penalty. 
C: This principle discusses the relationship between the harm caused by an infraction and the severity of the penalty, but does not address the issue of certainty required for imposing a penalty. 
D: This principle discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, but does not address the issue of certainty required for imposing a penalty. 
E: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning that a penalty should not be so severe that certainty of guilt cannot be established.

  D: This principle is related to who has the authority to approve an additional charge on water bills, but it does not directly relate to the judgment of the proposal's acceptability.
  E: This principle suggests that the utility should only collect additional charges for water-related expenditures, which is in line with the utility's proposal to build a dam that can benefit everyone.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The columnist believes that using the additional revenue from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam is unacceptable.
A: This principle is not relevant to the situation described in the context.
B: This principle is relevant to the context because it suggests that money collected from water bills, which is meant to fund a dam project that benefits the entire community, should not be used to build new roads that benefit only some members of the community.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Florida panthers are a critically endangered species.
  - Their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  - Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  
A: The statement may or may not be true, but it is not a logical conclusion from the given information.
B: This statement contradicts the information given, as it says that the population will be self-sustaining if it exceeds 250, while the given information says that it must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining.
C: This statement is a logical conclusion from the given information.
D: This statement contradicts the information given, which says that the population has increased significantly from the 1970s.
E: This statement contradicts the information given, which says that their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The Florida panther population has increased significantly since the 1970s.
- The current population of Florida panthers is between 70 to 100.
- The minimum number of Florida panthers required for self-sustenance is 250.
- The current habitat of Florida panthers is not large enough to support more individuals.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: The passage states that the current habitat of Florida panthers is not large enough to support more individuals. Therefore, unless the panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining. Choice A cannot be inferred from the information given, choice B is incorrect because the passage states that the population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining, not that it will be self-sustaining if it exceeds 250. Choice D is also incorrect because the passage states that the population has already increased significantly since the 1970s. Choice E is also incorrect because the passage does not give any information about the size of the habitat in the 1970s.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The current population of Florida panthers is 70 to 100.
  - This is a large increase from their numbers in the 1970s.
  - The population needs to reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining.
  - The current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.

Analysis:
  - The statements suggest that the current habitat is not large enough to support more panthers, and that a population of at least 250 is needed for self-sustainability.
  - Therefore, it can be inferred that the population will not be self-sustaining unless the panthers acquire a larger habitat.
  - This means that choice C is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The Florida panther population has increased since the 1970s but is still not large enough to be self-sustaining.
  - The current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers.
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat being only of marginal quality is not discussed in the context.
  B: The statement that if the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining is not supported by the context. 
  C: The statement that unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining is supported by the context.
  D: The statement that the population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level is not supported by the context.
  E: The statement that today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s is not supported by the context.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  A: This choice suggests that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, which would undermine the argument in the advertisement.
  B: This choice suggests that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less, on average, than people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time. This is not relevant to the argument in the advertisement.
  C: This choice suggests that there may be other insurance companies that would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. This may be true, but it does not undermine the argument in the advertisement.
  D: This choice suggests that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed may have underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, which would undermine the argument in the advertisement.
  E: This choice suggests that the people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders, which would undermine the argument in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a recent survey of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. 
  A: This choice weakens the argument by suggesting that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: This choice is irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the difference in the average price paid by new and longer-term policyholders. The argument is only concerned with the savings from switching to Popelka.
  C: This choice weakens the argument by suggesting that switching to another insurance company could enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. 
  D: This choice weakens the argument by suggesting that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: This choice weakens the argument by suggesting that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, after switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. The argument suggests that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
A: This choice is a valid criticism. The argument in the advertisement only mentions the average savings of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders and does not address the possibility that some policyholders might not save as much money. Therefore, it is vulnerable to the criticism that some of the surveyed policyholders saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
B: This choice is not a valid criticism. The argument does not take for granted that new policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
C: This choice is not a valid criticism. The argument does not claim that switching to Popelka is the only way to save money on auto insurance, nor does it suggest that switching to Popelka is the best way to save money on auto insurance.
D: This choice is not a valid criticism. The argument does not make any assumptions about whether the surveyed policyholders underestimated how much they saved by switching to Popelka.
E: This choice is not a valid criticism. The argument does not make any assumptions about whether people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

  B: This answer choice suggests that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed may have paid less for their auto insurance, on average, than people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: This answer choice suggests that there might be other insurance companies that offer even more savings than Popelka.
  D: This answer choice suggests that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed might have underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: This answer choice suggests that the sample of new Popelka auto insurance policyholders surveyed might not be representative of the population as a whole, and that people who are capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka might be overrepresented in the sample.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  A: This choice points out a possibility that could weaken the argument. If some of the new policyholders did not save money at all, then the average savings would be less than $250, and the argument would be weakened.
  B: This choice does not address the argument's claim about savings for new policyholders.
  C: This choice points out a possibility that could strengthen the argument. However, the argument does not claim that Popelka is the only insurance company that could save policyholders money, but rather that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  D: This choice does not address the argument's claim about savings for new policyholders.
  E: This choice points out a possibility that could weaken the argument. If the sample of new policyholders surveyed is not representative of all auto insurance policyholders, then the argument's claim that most people could save money by switching to Popelka may not be true.

The advertisement concludes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument and does not criticize the argument.
B: The argument does not mention anything about the payment of new policyholders, so this statement is not relevant to the argument and does not criticize the argument.
C: This statement might be a valid criticism as the argument does not address the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument and does not criticize the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

C: This statement is helpful in establishing that the college students were not older than the age range of Group A and thus the results are not skewed due to age differences between the groups.
D: This statement is helpful in establishing that both groups had the same resources available to them and thus the results are not skewed due to differences in access to telephones.
E: This statement is helpful in establishing that both groups had the same amount of time to prepare for the task and thus the results are not skewed due to differences in preparation time.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The study compared the ability of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), to remember to make a telephone call at a specified time.
  Group A performed better than Group B in making the call at the specified time.
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
 
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: 
  The number of people in each group was equal, which is important to ensure that the comparison between the two groups is fair. However, this fact does not help establish that the conclusion drawn is properly drawn. The other options provide information that supports the conclusion drawn, and therefore, are more helpful in establishing it.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage describes a study in which two groups of people, one composed of persons aged sixty-five to seventy-five and the other composed of college students, were required to make a telephone call at a specified time. Group A was far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than Group B. The passage concludes that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
A: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. The fact that there was the same number of people in each group ensures that the study was conducted with a balanced sample size.
B: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. The fact that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups ensures that the results were not influenced by differences in how the calls were received.
C: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. The fact that among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old ensures that the study was conducted with a balanced age distribution.
D: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. The fact that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls ensures that the study was conducted with a balanced testing environment.
E: This statement is the least helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. The fact that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls does not necessarily ensure that the study was conducted with a balanced testing environment or that the results were not influenced by differences in how the instructions were received.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the fact that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B (composed of college students).

A: This option seems helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn, as it eliminates the possibility that the difference in group size contributed to the results.
B: This option also seems helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn, as it eliminates the possibility that the researchers treating the groups differently contributed to the results.
C: This option seems irrelevant to the conclusion regarding memory, as it provides information about the age of the college students but not about their memory capabilities.
D: This option seems helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn, as it eliminates the possibility that unequal access to telephones contributed to the results.
E: This option seems helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn, as it eliminates the possibility that differences in the amount of time to prepare contributed to the results.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) was much better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than Group B (composed of college students). 
  A: This statement does not provide any information that would contradict the conclusion of the study.
  B: If the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, it would help ensure that any differences in the groups' performance were not due to differences in how the calls were answered.
  C: This statement does not provide any information that would contradict the conclusion of the study.
  D: Both groups having unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls is relevant to the study's methodology, but it does not contradict the conclusion of the study.
  E: If the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, it would help ensure that any differences in the groups' performance were not due to differences in the amount of time they had to prepare.

Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
Question: The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: widespread cynicism is beneficial to the wellbeing of society
  B: cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the am01mt of information one has about them
  C: the work of contemporary journalists reflects a cynicism that is not really genuine

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The study found that the rarest species of trees tend to survive longer in a particular forest, regardless of which species is the most common or the rarest.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist argues that a study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81.
  Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland.
  The pharmacist concludes that the claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.

B: This choice does not seem to apply to the argument made by the pharmacist.
C: This choice does not seem to apply to the argument made by the pharmacist.
D: This choice does not seem to apply to the argument made by the pharmacist.
E: This choice may apply to the argument made by the pharmacist because the sample used in the study may not be representative of the general population. However, this is not the main flaw in the argument.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The pharmacist's argument is based on a study that shows that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland and that the manufacturers of melatonin supplements claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
A: This choice does not apply to the argument.
B: This choice does not apply to the argument.
C: This choice does not apply to the argument.
D: The argument does not confuse an effect of a phenomenon with its cause. 
E: The argument does not provide information about the representativeness of the sample used in the study.

  The pharmacist's argument is based on a study that showed that melatonin alleviates symptoms of insomnia in people aged 65-81.
  Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland.
  The pharmacist claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
  
A: This choice does not apply to the pharmacist's argument.
B: This choice does not apply to the pharmacist's argument.
C: This choice does not apply to the pharmacist's argument.
D: The pharmacist's argument is flawed because it confuses the effect of a phenomenon with its cause. The study showed that melatonin alleviates symptoms of insomnia, but it did not establish that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages. The study does not support the causal relationship that the pharmacist is trying to establish.
E: This choice does not apply to the pharmacist's argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")

The pharmacist's argument is flawed because it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause. The fact that melatonin supplementation alleviates insomnia symptoms in older people does not necessarily mean that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages. It is possible that other factors are responsible for the decrease in melatonin levels, and that these factors are also responsible for the insomnia symptoms. Therefore, the argument's conclusion that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct is not necessarily valid. The other choices do not accurately describe the flaw in the argument.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist is arguing that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct based on a study showing that melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81.
  A: Inferring from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect is a flawed causal reasoning, but it is not present in the pharmacist's argument.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of biased individuals.
  C: The argument does not depend on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
  D: Confusing an effect of a phenomenon with its cause is a flawed causal reasoning, but it is not present in the pharmacist's argument.
  E: The argument does not rely on an unrepresentative sample.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The pharmacist argues that since a large study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia's symptoms, the claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
A: This choice describes the fallacy of making a causal inference from a mere correlation, but this is not the case here.
B: This choice suggests that the pharmacist may have relied on biased opinions, but the argument is based on a large study, so this is not the case.
C: This choice describes the fallacy of equivocation, or the use of a term with two different meanings, but this is not the case here.
D: This choice describes the fallacy of confusing cause and effect, but this is not the case here.
E: This choice suggests that the sample used in the study may not be representative of the population as a whole, which could affect the generalizability of the findings and the validity of the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist's argument is that the claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because a large study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81. 
  A: This choice describes the fallacy of inferring causation from correlation, but the argument in the context is not committing this fallacy. 
  B: This choice suggests that the argument relies on biased opinions, but the context does not provide any support for this claim.
  C: This choice suggests that the argument is equivocating on the term "melatonin," but the context does not provide any support for this claim.
  D: This choice describes the fallacy of confusing the cause and effect relationship, but the argument in the context is not committing this fallacy.
  E: This choice suggests that the sample used in the study is unrepresentative, which could be a flaw in the argument.

  B: There is no mention of relying on the opinions of biased individuals in the argument.
  C: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  D: The argument is flawed in that it infers the cause of insomnia from the effect of ingesting melatonin, which is alleviation of symptoms.
  E: There is no mention of the representativeness of the sample used in the study.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist argues that melatonin supplements work for elderly people suffering from insomnia because the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages. The pharmacist's argument relies on the assumption that the production of melatonin by the pineal gland is the only factor that affects the effectiveness of melatonin supplements. 
  A: The argument does not infer from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of biased individuals.
  C: The argument does not depend on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving back pain based on an experiment where 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group, and most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the first group might be due to the placebo effect and not the magnets themselves, but it does not offer a direct counter to the physician's argument.
B: This statement is a claim about what most physicians believe and does not directly counter the physician's argument.
C: This statement is about the scope of the experiment and does not directly counter the physician's argument.
D: This statement is about the scientists who designed the experiment and does not directly counter the physician's argument.
E: This statement suggests that the wide variation in the causes of chronic back pain could be a factor in the results of the experiment and could weaken the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain, based on the results of an experiment.
  A: This statement suggests that the patients in the first group may have reported less pain simply because they knew they were receiving a treatment, not because the magnets themselves were effective.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields at relieving back pain.
  C: This statement is relevant, but not necessarily a strong counter to the argument, as it is possible that no other experiments have been done yet, or that experiments have been done but did not produce significant results. 
  D: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields at relieving back pain.
  E: This statement is a strong counter to the physician's argument, as it suggests that the variation in the causes of the patients' back pain may have affected the results of the experiment, making it difficult to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of magnets for relieving back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment done on 50 patients with chronic back pain. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group, while the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the second group did.
  A: This statement suggests that the patients in the first group might have reported reduced pain simply because they knew they were receiving a treatment, even if the magnets themselves were not effective.
  B: This statement is an opinion and does not provide evidence to counter the physician's argument.
  C: This statement is about other experiments done with magnetic fields and does not provide evidence to counter the physician's argument about the specific experiment with the 50 patients.
  D: This statement suggests that there might have been some bias in the design of the experiment, but it does not provide evidence to counter the results of the experiment itself.
  E: This statement suggests that the variation in causes of chronic back pain might have affected the results of the experiment, and therefore provides the strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that the application of small magnets to the backs of patients with chronic back pain is probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the results of an experiment where 50 patients were divided into two groups and most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that improvement could have occurred due to the placebo effect, but it does not necessarily counter the physician's argument.
  B: This statement suggests that medication is more effective than magnets, but it does not necessarily counter the physician's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that there is no evidence that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back, but it does not necessarily counter the physician's argument.
  D: This statement suggests that some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed in the effectiveness of magnetic fields before the experiment, but it does not necessarily counter the physician's argument.
  E: This statement suggests that there was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment, which could have affected the results of the experiment, and thus, it presents the strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement provides an alternative explanation for why patients in the first group reported a reduction in pain, and thus undermines the causal relationship between the magnets and pain reduction.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the physician's argument, as it compares the effectiveness of magnets to medication rather than a placebo.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the physician's argument, as it pertains to the generalizability of the results rather than the validity of the study.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the physician's argument, as it pertains to the motives of the experimenters rather than the validity of the study.
  E: This statement undermines the internal validity of the study, as the variation in causes of chronic back pain may have affected the results.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment that showed most patients in the group that received magnets reported a significant reduction in pain compared to the group that did not receive treatment.
  A: This choice suggests that the improvement in pain could be due to a placebo effect rather than the magnets themselves, but it does not directly challenge the physician's argument.
  B: This choice presents an alternative treatment for chronic back pain, but it does not directly challenge the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective.
  C: This choice challenges the generalizability of the experiment's results, but it does not directly challenge the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  D: This choice is irrelevant to the argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields at relieving back pain.
  E: This choice suggests that the variation in causes of the chronic back pain could have affected the results of the experiment, which challenges the internal validity of the experiment and therefore directly challenges the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The physician has conducted an experiment with 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  The experiment had two groups, one received small magnets applied to the backs, and the other received no treatment.
  Most patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, but very few in the second group did.
A: This choice does not directly attack the argument. It is talking about the placebo effect, which is not the main issue of the argument.
B: This choice does not directly attack the argument. It is talking about the general belief of most physicians, but it does not provide any evidence that magnets are not effective.
C: This choice does not directly attack the argument. It is talking about the scope of the experiment, which is not the main issue of the argument.
D: This choice does not directly attack the argument. It is talking about the belief of some scientists, which is not the main issue of the argument.
E: This choice constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument. The wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could be a confounding variable that could have influenced the results of the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment where 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  
A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the first group might be due to a placebo effect rather than the magnetic fields. However, it does not directly counter the argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  
B: This statement suggests that medication is a more effective treatment for chronic back pain than magnets. However, it does not directly counter the argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.

C: This statement suggests that the experiment may not be reliable for concluding that magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain because there is no other evidence to support the conclusion that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back. This directly counters the physician's argument.

D: This statement suggests that the scientists may have had a bias towards the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain, but it does not directly counter the argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.

E: This statement suggests that the improvement in the first group might be due to differences in the specific causes of the back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment rather than the magnetic fields. However, it does not directly counter the argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment in which small magnets were applied to the backs of one group of patients with chronic back pain, and most of the patients in that group reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement provides an alternative explanation for why the patients in the first group reported a reduction in pain. It suggests that the patients' knowledge of receiving a treatment may have influenced their perception of pain relief, rather than the magnetic fields themselves.
  B: This statement provides an opinion on the effectiveness of magnets compared to medication, but it does not address the specific experiment or the physician's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that the experiment may not be generalizable to other areas of pain, but it does not address the specific experiment or the physician's argument.
  D: This statement provides information about the scientists involved in the experiment, but it does not address the specific experiment or the physician's argument.
  E: This statement suggests that the variation in causes of chronic back pain may have influenced the results of the experiment, and therefore weakens the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields for relieving back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain, based on the results of an experiment on 50 patients with chronic back pain. One group received small magnets applied to their backs, while the other group received no treatment. Most patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the second group did.
  A: This statement suggests that patients' beliefs or expectations about a treatment could be responsible for the observed reduction in pain and could explain the results of the experiment. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain.
  B: This statement presents an alternative treatment for chronic back pain, but it does not directly address the effectiveness of magnetic fields at relieving back pain, which is the subject of the physician's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that the results of the experiment may not be generalizable to other areas of pain relief, but it does not directly address the effectiveness of magnetic fields at relieving back pain, which is the subject of the physician's argument.
  D: This statement suggests that the experiment may have been biased in favor of the hypothesis that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but it does not directly address the effectiveness of magnetic fields at relieving back pain, which is the subject of the physician's argument.
  E: This statement suggests that the observed reduction in pain may have been due to variations in the specific causes of the patients' chronic back pain, rather than the magnetic fields. Therefore, it constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain.

  B: If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then it undermines the argument that Lopez made better arguments.
  C: This statement is irrelevant because it talks about the likelihood of voting for Tanner based on whether they watched the debate or not, not about bias in favor of Lopez among the viewers surveyed immediately after the debate.
  D: This statement is irrelevant because it talks about the viewers' voting intentions prior to the debate, not about bias in favor of Lopez among the viewers surveyed immediately after the debate.
  E: This statement is irrelevant because it talks about the margin of victory, not about bias in favor of Lopez among the viewers surveyed immediately after the debate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that the survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez, but it is not clear why they may have been biased. 
  A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument. Whether or not most people who voted in the election did not watch the debate does not affect the argument's conclusion that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased.
  B: This choice weakens the argument's conclusion that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then it is less likely that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  C: This choice is irrelevant to the argument. Whether or not the people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate does not affect the argument's conclusion that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased.
  D: This choice is irrelevant to the argument. Whether or not most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner does not affect the argument's conclusion that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased.
  E: This choice is also irrelevant to the argument. Whether or not Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin does not affect the argument's conclusion that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
- Lopez eventually won the election.
- The question is asking for the option that most seriously undermines the argument.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Option B states that most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. This information contradicts the survey results mentioned in the argument and suggests that the survey respondents who thought that Lopez was more persuasive may have been biased in favor of Lopez. Therefore, option B undermines the argument the most.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The new computer program of Country X tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  The government of Country X reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  
Analysis:
  The new computer program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period, so the number of paychecks issued by some employers to the same employee will be counted as multiple employees. Therefore, the government of Country X overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and uses that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis: 
  The new computer program simply tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and uses that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed compared with the immediately preceding quarter. However, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. 

A: There is no information to support this conclusion.
B: There is no information to support this conclusion.
C: There is no information to support this conclusion.
D: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed might have been overestimated since some employees may have received multiple paychecks for a pay period.
E: There is no information to support this conclusion.

  C: There is no information to support that the government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used. Incorrect.
  D: The new program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. Therefore, if some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions, the program would overestimate the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The fact that some employers issued separate paychecks for different types of compensation suggests that the number of paychecks issued per pay period may not be an accurate estimate of the number of people employed. Therefore, the government's estimate of employment growth may be inaccurate.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks issued by employers in Country X to determine the number of people employed.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses/commissions.
  
A: The accuracy of the government's estimate of employment growth is not addressed by the fact that some workers receive multiple paychecks.
B: The fact that some workers receive multiple paychecks does not necessarily mean that the designers of the program were not aware of this possibility.
C: The government's reports of employment growth in the quarters prior to the new program are not discussed in the passage.
D: Since some workers receive multiple paychecks, the total number of paychecks issued by employers would overestimate the number of people employed. Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
E: The passage does not provide evidence to support or refute the government's claims of growth in employment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The government of Country X started using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in the country.
  The program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.

Analysis:
  The new computer program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. It did not take into account the fact that some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the government's estimate of the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used is likely to be higher than the actual number of people employed.

Analysis: 
  The fact that some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions implies that the number of paychecks issued may not be a reliable estimate of the number of people employed in Country X.

A: There is no evidence to suggest that the government's estimate of employment growth was less accurate after the new program was used.
B: It is not clear whether the people who designed the new program were aware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
C: The passage does not provide any information about whether the government had reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
D: If some employers issued separate paychecks for different types of pay, then the total number of paychecks would not accurately reflect the total number of people employed, so the government may have overestimated employment for the first quarter in which the program was used. 
E: The passage does not provide any evidence to support the claim that there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

Action: Answer("D")

  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis: 
  The new program simply tallied the number of paychecks issued per pay period and used that as its estimate of employment, which means it did not take into account the possibility that some employees receive more than one paycheck per pay period. As some employees received separate paychecks for the regular hours, overtime, and bonuses/commissions, the total number of people employed might have been overestimated by the government using the new program. Therefore, it can be concluded that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50% of all hair dryer sales five years ago and now it only accounts for 25% of such sales. The argument also states that the average net income Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, but the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: This choice correctly identifies that the argument mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the past 5 years, which is not necessarily true.
B: This choice introduces a new idea about profits generated by hair dryers, but it is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: This choice is also not relevant to the argument's reasoning as the argument is only discussing sales figures for Wilson Appliance's hair dryers.
D: This choice introduces a new idea about the retail price of the hair dryer, but it is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
E: This choice is also not relevant to the argument's reasoning as the argument is only discussing the net income from sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago, but currently it only accounts for 25% of such sales. The argument also states that the company's net income per hair dryer has not changed over the last 5 years.
A: This is correct. The argument assumes that the decline in Wilson Appliance Company's market share of hair dryers is due to a decline in sales of the product itself, rather than an increase in the number of competitors in the market. It is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant or even increased while Wilson Appliance's market share has declined.
B: This is incorrect. The argument does not need to provide information about the profits generated by other companies in order to be valid.
C: This is incorrect. The argument is focused specifically on Wilson Appliance's hair dryer product, so it is not necessary to discuss the sales figures for other products.
D: This is incorrect. The argument assumes that the net income per hair dryer sold has remained constant, so it does not take into account changes in the retail price of the product.
E: This is incorrect. The argument does not provide any evidence about the profitability of Wilson Appliance's other products, but this information is not necessary to evaluate the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the hair dryer produced by Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago, and currently, it accounts for only 25% of such sales. The company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was five years ago because of this decline, and the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last five years.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It states that the product accounts for a smaller percentage of all sales of hair dryers nationwide, which implies that there has been an increase in the total sales of hair dryers.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them because it is focused on the net income of Wilson Appliance Company.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers because it is focused on the net income of the hair dryer product.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past five years. This could have compensated for the decline in market share and kept the net income from sales of the product constant.
E: The argument does not provide any evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has declined from 50% to 25% over the last 5 years. It mentions that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, and concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago. 
A: This is a possible flaw in the reasoning because the argument assumes that the decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is equivalent to a decline in the total sales of that product. It is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased over the last 5 years, which would mean that the actual number of hair dryers sold by Wilson Appliance has increased even if their market share has decreased.
B: This is not a flaw in the reasoning because the argument is not concerned with the profits generated by other companies that produce hair dryers.
C: This is not a flaw in the reasoning because the argument is concerned only with the sales figures of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers.
D: This is a possible flaw in the reasoning, because if the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has increased over the past 5 years, then their net income from sales of the product may not have declined as much as the decline in market share would suggest.
E: This is not a flaw in the reasoning because the argument is not concerned with whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago and now accounts for only 25 percent of such sales. It also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. And it concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It clearly states that the product accounts for only 25 percent of such sales now.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. It focuses on Wilson Appliance's product only.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers. It focuses on the hair dryer product only.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years. If the retail price had increased, it would have affected the net income of the company.
E: The argument does not provide any evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago because of a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer and the assumption that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  A: This choice correctly identifies that the argument mistakes a decline in market share for a decline in total sales, which is a flaw in the reasoning.
  B: This choice provides information that is not relevant to the conclusion in the argument.
  C: This choice is not relevant to the conclusion in the argument.
  D: This choice provides an alternative possibility that is not considered in the argument, but it does not necessarily undermine the reasoning.
  E: This choice provides information that is not relevant to the conclusion in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's product sales declined from 50% to 25% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide, but the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Based on this decline in market share, the argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It is clear that the market share of the product has declined from 50% to 25%. 
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. 
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's other products as it only focuses on the hair dryer product. 
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which could explain why the company's net income from sales of the product has not decreased despite the decline in market share. 
E: The argument does not provide evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer sales declined from 50% to 25% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide over the last 5 years.
  The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: This is the correct answer. The argument confuses the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer with a decline in the total sales of that product. The decrease in market share does not necessarily mean that the total sales of the product have decreased. It is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased over the last 5 years.
  B: The argument does not depend on specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them.
  C: The argument only discusses the sales figures for Wilson Appliance's hair dryers, so it is not necessary to discuss sales figures for other products.
  D: The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed, so an increase in the retail price of the hair dryer would not affect the argument.
  E: The argument does not discuss whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that the decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer caused the company's net income from sales of the product to be only half of what it was 5 years ago. 
  A: This is incorrect. The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It simply uses the decline in market share to make an argument about the company's net income.
  B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for companies that produce them. It is irrelevant to the argument.
  C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers. It is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: This is a possible flaw in the argument. If the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has increased over the past 5 years, then the company's net income from sales of the product may not be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  E: The argument does not need to provide independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. It is irrelevant to the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument made by the scientist is that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument made by the scientist.
  B: If genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, it would suggest that the progenitors of the species on the islands did not come directly from the Americas.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not necessarily weaken the argument that the iguanas on the islands came across on floating debris.
  D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, it would suggest that the progenitors of the species on the islands may have come from Australia instead of the Americas.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument made by the scientist.

  B: If genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, it would suggest that the progenitors of the species did not raft on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, which would weaken the scientist's argument.
  C: If documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon, it would suggest that the progenitors of the species did not raft on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, but it is not strong enough to significantly weaken the scientist's argument.
  D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, it would suggest that the progenitors of the species did not raft on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, which would weaken the scientist's argument.
  E: This statement is irrelevant and does not weaken the scientist's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The scientist's argument is about how the iguana species found on a group of islands near Australia got there. The scientist argues that the progenitors of these species must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia.

A: This statement does not directly weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguana species got to the islands. It only mentions that not all animal species found on the islands are found in the Americas.
B: This statement does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument. Genetic differences between the iguana species on the islands and those found in the Americas could be due to genetic drift or other factors. 
C: This statement does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument either. Just because documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon, it does not mean that it did not happen in this case.
D: This statement does not weaken the scientist's argument. The fact that fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia does not contradict the idea that the progenitors of these species rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
E: This statement is about the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America that date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana. This statement does not directly weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguana species got to the islands.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument presented by the scientist states that the iguana species on a small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, as the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
A: This statement does not affect the argument presented by the scientist since the argument is only about the iguana species, not all animal species on the islands.
B: This statement does not weaken the argument presented by the scientist since genetic differences between the iguana species on the islands and those found in the Americas do not rule out the possibility of rafting across the Pacific Ocean.
C: This statement does not affect the argument presented by the scientist since the argument is not based on the frequency of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses.
D: This statement weakens the argument presented by the scientist since it suggests that the progenitors of the iguana species on the islands could have come from Australia, not the Americas.
E: This statement does not weaken the argument presented by the scientist since the argument is only about the iguana species on the islands and does not depend on the date of the fragmentation of Gondwana for all plant and animal species found in Australia or South America.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist's argument is that the species of iguanas on the islands near Australia originated from the Americas and rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the scientist's argument about the origin of the iguanas on the islands.
  B: If genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, then it weakens the argument that they originated from the Americas.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

  D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The editorialist assumes that the studies conducted 30 years ago still apply today, without considering any new evidence that might contradict them.
  E: This choice presents an alternative possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not a flaw in the argument itself.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, based on studies conducted 30 years ago.
  A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate flaw. The argument does rely on a limited number of particular instances to draw a general conclusion.
  B: This choice suggests that the argument fails to consider the possibility that safety technology could change over time. However, the argument specifically mentions that the increase in air traffic would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  C: This choice suggests that the argument fails to consider that council members are aware of the studies. However, the argument does not address whether or not council members are aware of the studies.
  D: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the argument. The editorialist assumes that just because there is evidence against the claim that increasing air traffic would not decrease safety, the opposite must be true.
  E: This choice suggests that there might be other benefits to increasing air traffic that could outweigh the slight increase in safety risks. However, the argument does not address this possibility.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, citing studies conducted 30 years ago as evidence.
  A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but not the one that is most accurate. The argument does not draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: This choice describes a possible flaw in the argument, but there is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the latest technology would make a difference.
  C: This choice does not describe a flaw in the argument, as the fact that the council members may be aware of the studies does not affect the validity of the editorialist's argument.
  D: This accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The editorialist cites studies from 30 years ago as evidence, but fails to consider whether there is any evidence to support the claim that the latest safety technology would make a difference.
  E: This choice does not describe a flaw in the argument, as the editorialist is focusing solely on the issue of safety.
Action: Answer("D")

C: This choice describes a potential counterargument to the editorialist's argument, but it does not accurately capture the argument's flaw.
D: This accurately describes the editorialist's flaw. The editorialist assumes that the studies conducted 30 years ago are still relevant today, without considering whether there has been any new evidence or technology that might change the validity of those studies.
E: This choice describes a potential counterargument to the editorialist's argument, but it does not accurately capture the argument's flaw.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, citing studies conducted 30 years ago.
A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it does not accurately describe the flaw. The argument does not draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement inferred from a limited number of particular instances.
B: This choice describes a possible flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate flaw. The argument does not consider the possibility that the latest technology might allow for increased air traffic without reducing safety.
C: This choice does not describe a flaw in the argument. The argument acknowledges that the council members support the increase, but it disputes their claim that the increase would not reduce safety.
D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The argument assumes that the absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity means that such evidence does not exist, when in fact evidence against this claim does exist.
E: This choice describes a possible flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate flaw. The argument does not consider the possibility that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original capacity will decrease safety, despite the purchase of the latest safety technology. The editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago to support this claim.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the statistics that reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.

A: This criticism is not valid as the argument does not compare the severity of injuries between accidents on roads with or without bicycle lanes. It only compares the number of collisions.
B: This criticism is not valid either because the argument does not rely on the number of bicyclists riding on roads with or without bicycle lanes.
C: This criticism is not relevant to the argument as it doesn't assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
D: This is a valid criticism because the argument uses a limited set of data to draw a general conclusion, without considering other variables that may affect the safety of bicyclists on roads with bicycle lanes.
E: This is not a valid criticism as the argument does not use statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that adding bike lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because there are more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads with bike lanes than on roads without them.
A: This is a possible criticism, but it is not the most vulnerable to the argument because the argument does not address the severity of injuries.
B: This is not a criticism of the argument because the argument is based on the number of collisions, not the number of bicyclists.
C: This is not a criticism of the argument because the argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
D: This is not a correct criticism of the argument because the argument does not claim that only some roads that currently have bike lanes are safe.
E: This is the most vulnerable criticism of the argument. The argument uses statistical evidence to support its conclusion, but the evidence does not support the conclusion, so the argument is flawed.
Action: Answer("E")

  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, and that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  
A: This answer choice is relevant, but it is not the best criticism of the argument. The argument does not address the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with and without bicycle lanes.
  
B: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument. The argument is concerned with the safety of bicyclists on roads with bicycle lanes versus roads without bicycle lanes, not the number of bicyclists on each type of road.
  
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument. The argument is only concerned with the safety of bicyclists, not motorists.
  
D: This answer choice is not relevant, and it actually misrepresents the argument. The argument does not claim that only some roads with bicycle lanes are safe. It claims that more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes than on roads without them.
  
E: This answer choice is the best criticism of the argument. The argument uses statistical evidence to support a conclusion about the safety of bicyclists, but the evidence does not actually support that conclusion.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, and supports this claim by citing statistics that reveal more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  
A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument since it does not address the argument's claim that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  
B: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument since it does not address the argument's claim that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument since it does not address the argument's claim that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  
D: This answer choice is a possible criticism of the argument. The argument's conclusion is based on statistics that reveal more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. However, if the only roads that currently have such lanes are unsafe, then the argument's conclusion may not hold for roads that do not currently have such lanes. Therefore, this answer choice is the correct answer.
  
E: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument since it does not address the argument's claim that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  A: This option introduces the possibility of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes being as serious as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes, but it does not directly criticize the argument.
  B: This option introduces the possibility of more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes, but it does not directly criticize the argument.
  C: This option criticizes the argument for taking for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  D: This option criticizes the argument for concluding that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
  E: This option criticizes the argument for taking statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.

Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
A: This choice is not relevant to the argument. The argument is about the safety of bicyclists on roads with bicycle lanes compared to roads without such lanes, not about the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument. The argument is about the safety of bicyclists on roads with bicycle lanes compared to roads without such lanes, not about the number of bicyclists riding on each type of road.
C: This choice is not relevant to the argument. The argument is not making any assumptions about the effect of road alterations on the safety of motorists.
D: This choice is not accurate. The argument is not claiming that only some roads with bicycle lanes are safe, but rather that roads with bicycle lanes are not safer than roads without such lanes.
E: This choice is the best answer. The argument is using statistical evidence in a way that does not support its conclusion. The fact that more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes does not prove that bicycle lanes are unsafe. It is possible that more collisions occur on these roads simply because there are more bicyclists using them.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.

B: This criticism does not address the argument's conclusion that adding bicycle lanes is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
C: This criticism is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
D: This criticism does not accurately represent the argument's conclusion. The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on statistics that show more collisions occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
E: This criticism is not relevant to the argument because the argument is not based on statistical evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, and it supports this claim with the fact that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.

A: This answer choice addresses the seriousness of injuries sustained by bicyclists, which is unrelated to the argument's claim that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
B: This answer choice addresses the number of bicyclists on roads with bicycle lanes, which is unrelated to the argument's claim that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
C: This answer choice addresses the assumption that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists, which is unrelated to the argument's claim that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
D: This answer choice misrepresents the argument's claim. The argument does not conclude that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe. Instead, it concludes that adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
E: This answer choice suggests that the argument uses statistical evidence that supports the opposite conclusion, but the argument does not use statistical evidence that supports the opposite conclusion.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  A: This choice suggests that the argument overlooks the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes. This is not directly related to the argument presented.
  B: This choice suggests that the argument fails to address the possibility of more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes. This is not directly related to the argument presented.
  C: This choice suggests that the argument takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists. This is not directly related to the argument presented.
  D: This choice suggests that the argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe. This is not what the argument states.
  E: This choice suggests that the argument takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion. This is the most relevant criticism of the argument, as the argument assumes that the statistical evidence proves that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads will not enhance the safety of bicyclists, when in fact the evidence only shows a correlation between designated bicycle lanes and bicycle-motor vehicle accidents.

  A: This choice provides an example of insects that have vision similar to that of bees but do not depend on perceiving an object's color. However, it does not directly support the statement above.
  B: This choice provides an example of flowers that rely on insects other than bees, which suggests that the development of flowers is not solely dependent on bees. Therefore, this choice weakens the statement above.
  C: This choice is irrelevant to the statement above. The number of different species of flowers and bees does not necessarily indicate whether flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  D: This choice is irrelevant to the statement above. The fact that many nonflowering plants rely on bees does not necessarily indicate whether flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  E: This choice weakens the statement above. If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, it suggests that bees' vision may have developed in response to the presence of flowers rather than the other way around.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The statement claims that it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
  A: This choice is irrelevant to the claim made in the statement.
  B: This choice is also irrelevant to the claim made in the statement.
  C: This choice is also irrelevant to the claim made in the statement.
  D: This choice is also irrelevant to the claim made in the statement.
  E: If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The statement above suggests that flowers evolved to be the way they are due to bees' vision, rather than bees' vision adapting to flower color.
  A: This statement does not support the idea that flowers evolved due to bees' vision. It suggests that other insects with similar vision do not need to rely on color perception, but it does not address the relationship between flowers and bees.
  B: This statement does not support the idea that flowers evolved due to bees' vision. It suggests that some flowers rely on insects other than bees, but it does not address the relationship between flowers and bees.
  C: This statement does not support the idea that flowers evolved due to bees' vision. It suggests that there are more species of flowers than bees, but it does not address the relationship between flowers and bees.
  D: This statement does not support the idea that flowers evolved due to bees' vision. It suggests that many nonflowering plants rely on bees, but it does not address the relationship between flowers and bees.
  E: This statement supports the idea that flowers evolved due to bees' vision. It suggests that bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, which implies that flowers evolved to attract bees as pollinators.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument presents a trade-off between health benefits and environmental consequences. Recommending a healthier diet based on fish would cause overfishing and marine species extinction, making the diet impossible. 
A: This argument presents a potential risk associated with the use of vitamin E supplements, which is not yet fully established. Therefore, it is suggested not to recommend the use of vitamin E supplements to everyone.
B: This argument presents a potential consequence of heavy taxation on tobacco, which is reduced funding for education if people smoke less. Therefore, such taxes might require additional sources of revenue.
C: This argument presents a trade-off between individual consumer benefits and macroeconomic consequences. If everyone saves more and spends less, the economy might suffer, making saving and investing impossible for most people. Therefore, this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
D: This argument presents a reason why legislators spend a lot of time campaigning, which is to get reelected. Therefore, it is not surprising that they spend a lot of time campaigning.
E: This argument presents a trade-off between preserving wilderness areas and reducing the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas. Therefore, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

Option A cannot be inferred from the given text as the text only talks about cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago, and not the worst air pollution today. Option B is incorrect as the text does not provide information about cities that have worse air pollution today. Option C is not mentioned in the text. Option D is not necessarily true as the text does not provide information about the most polluted cities today.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage mentions that public outcries against pollution have led to stricter regulations of emissions, which in turn have greatly improved air quality in the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. The passage clearly states that "This would not have happened without these stricter regulations." Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

The statement mentions that public outcries against pollution have brought about stricter regulations of emissions, and that as a result, the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Therefore, the correct answer is E. 

A cannot be inferred from the statements above, as the statement only says that the air quality in the most polluted cities 30 years ago has improved, not that it is the best today.
B cannot be inferred from the statements above, as the statement only talks about the air quality in the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.
C cannot be inferred from the statements above, as there is no information about where most of the public outcries against pollution came from.
D cannot be inferred from the statements above, as the statement only says that the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality, but it does not say which cities are the most polluted today.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
The passage states that stricter regulations of emissions were brought about due to public outcries against pollution. Also, it is mentioned that cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Thus, the correct answer is E. 

A cannot be inferred from the passage. 
B is not correct because it is not stated that no city has worse air pollution today than it did 30 years ago. 
C is not correct because it is not stated that most of the public outcries against pollution came from people in the cities that had the most polluted air. 
D is not correct because it is not stated that the most polluted cities today are not the cities that were the most polluted 30 years ago.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage states that public outcries against pollution have brought about stricter regulations of emissions, and that cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Choice A is not necessarily true, as it does not indicate that the city with the worst air pollution 30 years ago is the same as the city with the worst air pollution today. Choice B is not supported by the passage, as it does not indicate that no city has worse air pollution today than it did 30 years ago. Choice C is not necessarily true, as the passage does not specify where most of the public outcries against pollution came from. Choice D is not necessarily true, as the passage only discusses cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago and does not compare them to the most polluted cities today.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The employee argues that website filtering software is not an effective way to increase productivity since other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not eliminated. 

A: This argument is about how people react differently to substances, so moderation is not an effective way to ensure that everyone is safe from harm. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
B: This argument is about how banning electronic devices is not an effective way to prevent cancer since most chemicals cause cancer in high doses. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
C: This argument is about how Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 of its employees will retire. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
D: This argument is about how creating engaging characters is not a guarantee for a novel or story's success since publishers and agents may reject manuscripts that focus too much on character development. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
E: This argument is about how a film's success should not be solely judged based on its profit relative to cost since it is counterintuitive. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The employee is arguing that the company's reasoning for installing website filtering software is flawed, as it assumes that distractions always prevent people from doing their best work. The employee points out that other distractions, such as windows or decorations, are not treated in the same way. 
A: This argument is about differences in how people react to substances, and how this affects the idea of moderation. It is not similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument. 
B: This argument is about the idea that just because something can cause harm in large doses, it should not necessarily be banned outright. It is not similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument. 
C: This argument is about the idea that if a certain number of employees are retiring, then a company will need to hire an equal number of people to replace them. It is not similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument. 
D: This argument is about the idea that engaging characters do not necessarily guarantee a successful novel or story. It is not similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument. 
E: This argument is about the idea that judging a movie's success based on its profit relative to its cost is misguided. It is not similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not the best way to increase productivity because other distractions, such as offices that have windows or are nicely decorated, can be just as distracting. 
  A: The argument is about how different people react differently to certain substances and that moderation is not the best way to approach this issue. This argument is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  B: The argument is about banning electronic devices because they cause cancer in laboratory animals. This argument is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  C: The argument is about Acme needing to replace retiring employees to maintain its current workforce. This argument is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  D: The argument is about how engaging characters do not guarantee a sale for a novel or story. This argument is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The employee argues that the company's reasoning for blocking non-work-related websites is flawed because other factors in the office, such as windows and decorations, can also be distracting. 
  A: The argument is about biological differences and how they affect what counts as moderation, which is not similar to the employee's argument.
  B: The argument is about banning a device due to its potential to cause cancer, and how not all chemicals that cause cancer should be banned, which is not similar to the employee's argument.
  C: The argument is about a company needing to hire new employees to replace those who are retiring, which is not similar to the employee's argument.
  D: The argument is about how engaging characters do not guarantee a successful novel, which is not similar to the employee's argument.
  E: The argument is about how using profit relative to cost as a measure of success in the movie industry is misguided, which is not similar to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute
  E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending a controversial distinction between lying and withholding relevant information in interviews by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The journalist argues that while both lying and withholding relevant information in interviews involve intentional deception, they are different in that lying actively encourages a false belief, while withholding information does not.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding information by offering an example of a clear instance of the distinction. Specifically, the journalist argues that lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief, while withholding information is not unethical because it does not actively encourage a false belief. The journalist then argues that those who fail to make this distinction fail to recognize the difference between actively encouraging a false belief and failing to prevent one. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between withholding relevant information and lying by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The journalist is arguing that withholding relevant information in interviews is not the same as lying because it does not actively encourage a false belief, unlike lying. Therefore, choice B is the correct answer.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding relevant information by offering an example of a clear instance of such distinction. The journalist argues that withholding relevant information in interviews is not the same as lying because it does not actively encourage a false belief, and this is illustrated by the fact that journalists commonly use this technique to elicit new information. Therefore, the journalist is defending a controversial distinction by offering an example of it. Hence, the correct answer is B.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding information by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The journalist argues that withholding relevant information is not the same as lying because it does not actively encourage a false belief. Therefore, the journalist is defending a controversial distinction by offering an example of it. Choice B accurately describes the journalist's argument.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding information by offering an example of a clear instance of it. They argue that withholding relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information is not the same as lying, because lying actively encourages a false belief, while withholding information does not.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply. The journalist is arguing that while withholding relevant information in interviews may be seen as intentional deception, it is not the same as lying because it does not actively encourage a false belief, which is what makes lying unethical. Therefore, the journalist is comparing the two cases to clarify and defend the moral principle that lying is unethical.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding information by offering an example of a clear instance of withholding information. The journalist argues that withholding information is not the same as lying because it does not actively encourage a false belief. Therefore, the journalist is defending what they consider a controversial distinction by offering an example of it. Hence, the correct answer is B.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding information by giving an example. The example is that lying actively encourages a false belief, whereas withholding information only fails to prevent a false belief. By doing so, the journalist is trying to show that the argument that withholding information is unethical because it is intentional deception fails to recognize this distinction.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding information by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The journalist argues that withholding information, unlike lying, does not actively encourage a false belief. Therefore, the argument is based on a controversial distinction and the journalist uses an example to support this distinction.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens immune response because it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. The argument then claims that this is different from M tuberculosis because only about 10 percent of the people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement weakens the argument's reasoning because it suggests that the presence of M tuberculosis does not provide any benefits to the host, which is the same argument being made against H pylori.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response. The counterexample is M tuberculosis, which does not benefit the host and can cause tuberculosis in some people, and no one would call it a commensal.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning by reinforcing the idea that M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement weakens the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the sheer number of people who have H pylori and don't develop ulcers could be evidence that it is a commensal.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument claims that H. pylori cannot be considered a commensal, despite allegedly strengthening the immune response, since it causes stomach ulcers in some individuals. The argument compares this to M. tuberculosis, which also causes illness in some individuals but is not considered a commensal. 
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: This statement challenges the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the presence of a bacterium that causes illness in some individuals does not preclude it from being considered a commensal if it also provides benefits to other individuals.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal despite its alleged immune-strengthening properties because it can cause stomach ulcers, even though only less than 10% of people carrying it develop this condition. The argument cites M tuberculosis as an example of a bacterium that does not confer any benefits to its host, but the argument does not provide any evidence to support this claim.
  A: This statement does not undermine the argument's reasoning. It provides information about the treatment of these two conditions, but it does not address the argument's claims about commensals and their effects on the human body.
  B: This statement does not undermine the argument's reasoning. It provides information about the duration of tuberculosis and ulcers caused by H pylori, but it does not address the argument's claims about commensals and their effects on the human body.
  C: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the absence of benefits from M tuberculosis does not necessarily preclude its classification as a commensal. If it is possible for a bacterium to be classified as a commensal even if it confers no benefits to its host, then the argument's claims about H pylori and commensals are weakened.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. The number of people carrying each bacterium is not relevant to the argument's claims about commensals and their effects on the human body.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The question stem describes a naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. The evidence cited is an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: The fact that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory is not enough to cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim. It is possible that the polar bear was adjusting its course based on environmental factors or other factors.
  B: The fact that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim. It is possible that the polar bear was still navigating based on its senses rather than following a predetermined route.
  C: The fact that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim. It is possible that the polar bear was still navigating based on its senses despite the difficult terrain.
  D: The fact that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim. This fact is not specific enough to polar bears to be relevant to the argument.
  E: The fact that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim. It is possible that the polar bear was still navigating based on its senses, including smell.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The question stem provides information about the ability of polar bears to navigate over considerable distances, and cites an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: This choice provides information about the behavior of a polar bear that is returning to its home territory, but doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence supporting the naturalists' claim.
  B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it is possible that the bear was already familiar with the area and could have used other sensory cues to navigate back to its home territory. Therefore, this choice casts doubt on the validity of the naturalists' claim.
  C: This choice provides information about the terrain over which the polar bear traveled, but doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence supporting the naturalists' claim.
  D: This choice provides information about other species of mammals that have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, but doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence supporting the naturalists' claim.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. The colon cancer rate is much higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: The argument is not concerned with whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably or not. This choice is irrelevant to the argument.
B: The argument is not concerned with whether high-fiber diets reduce the risk of other types of cancer. This choice is irrelevant to the argument.
C: The argument is not concerned with whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets. This choice is irrelevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not compare the levels of cancer-fighting properties in different types of fiber. This choice is irrelevant to the argument.
E: This choice is consistent with the argument's conclusion that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer. However, the argument overlooks the possibility that there may be other factors that contribute to the lower incidence of colon cancer in non-Western countries. For example, non-Western countries may have different lifestyle factors, such as higher physical activity levels or lower obesity rates, that also contribute to the lower incidence of colon cancer.

The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence. The colon cancer rate in Western countries is higher than in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods. In Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber. The argument concludes that insufficient fiber consumption causes colon cancer, and sufficient fiber consumption prevents it.

A: The argument is not concerned with the trend in fiber consumption. It is focused on the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer incidence. Hence, this option is not relevant to the argument and can be eliminated.

B: The argument is only concerned about the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer. It does not address whether high-fiber diets reduce the risk of other types of cancer. Hence, this option is not relevant to the argument and can be eliminated.

C: This option is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not address whether it is difficult for people to include fiber in their diets.

D: The argument does not differentiate between the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals. The argument is only concerned with the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer incidence. Hence, this option is not relevant to the argument and can be eliminated.

E: This option is relevant to the argument because it suggests that other substances in fiber-rich foods may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, rather than fiber alone. Hence, it is a possible criticism of the argument.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets are negatively correlated with the incidence of colon cancer, and that the consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, which is focused on the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant, as the argument is specifically concerned with the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
  C: This statement is not relevant, as the argument is not concerned with the difficulties of incorporating fiber into one's diet.
  D: This statement is not relevant, as the argument is not concerned with the relative cancer-fighting properties of different types of fiber.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer, while low-fiber diets increase the incidence of colon cancer.
  A: The argument does not address the trend of increasing or decreasing consumption of fiber in any country. It only compares the incidence of colon cancer in countries with high and low fiber diets.
  B: The argument does not claim that high-fiber diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer. It only focuses on colon cancer.
  C: The argument does not address the difficulty of including fiber in people's diets. It only compares the incidence of colon cancer in countries with high and low fiber diets.
  D: The argument does not differentiate between the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals. It only claims that both types of fiber are associated with lower incidence of colon cancer.
  E: This choice provides a possible criticism of the argument. The argument assumes that it is the fiber in fruits, vegetables, and cereals that is responsible for the lower incidence of colon cancer, but it overlooks the possibility that other substances in these foods may be responsible for the observed effect.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. The colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables. In Scandinavia, it has been shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fiber. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: The argument does not discuss whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably. This information is irrelevant to the argument.
B: The argument does not discuss the risk of many types of cancer being reduced by high-fiber diets. This information is irrelevant to the argument.
C: The argument does not discuss whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets. This information is irrelevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not discuss whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees. This information is irrelevant to the argument.
E: The argument overlooks the possibility that foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer. This is a potential criticism of the argument's reasoning. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It further states that in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, the incidence of colon cancer is lower. In Scandinavia, it has been shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably or not. This information is not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument does not address whether high-fiber diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer or not. This information is not relevant to the argument.
C: The argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets or not. This information is not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not address whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees or not. This information is not relevant to the argument.
E: This is a possible criticism of the argument. The argument assumes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. However, it overlooks the possibility that other substances in foods containing fiber may also contribute to preventing colon cancer. Therefore, this is the best answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
  A: This fact does not address the argument's reasoning.
  B: This fact does not address the argument's reasoning.
  C: This fact does not address the argument's reasoning.
  D: This fact does not address the argument's reasoning.
  E: This could be a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning because it suggests that the cancer-fighting properties of other substances in fiber-containing foods may be the actual cause of the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer incidence, rather than fiber itself. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It cites studies that suggest that colon cancer rates in Western countries are higher than in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods. The argument also cites a study in Scandinavia that found a correlation between low consumption of cereals (which are high in fiber) and high colon cancer rates. The argument concludes that insufficient fiber consumption causes colon cancer and sufficient fiber consumption prevents it.
A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fther is rising or falling in many countries. This is not relevant to the argument's conclusion about the relationship between fther consumption and colon cancer.
B: The argument does not address whether high-fther diets reduce the risk of other types of cancer. The argument only focuses on the relationship between fther consumption and colon cancer.
C: The argument does not address whether fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets. Even if this were the case, it would not necessarily undermine the argument's conclusion that insufficient fther consumption causes colon cancer and sufficient fther consumption prevents it.
D: The argument does not address whether the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees. The argument only focuses on the relationship between fther consumption and colon cancer.
E: This choice presents an alternative explanation for the relationship between fther consumption and colon cancer that is not addressed in the argument. It suggests that other substances in foods containing fther may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, rather than fther itself. This is a potential criticism of the argument's conclusion that insufficient fther consumption causes colon cancer and sufficient fther consumption prevents it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. People in non-Western countries, where diets are typically richer in fiber, have lower rates of colon cancer. Similarly, in Scandinavia, areas with lower consumption of cereals (which are high in fiber) have higher rates of colon cancer. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

A: Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion that insufficient fiber consumption causes colon cancer, and sufficient fiber consumption prevents it. 
B: The argument focuses specifically on the relationship between fiber and colon cancer, and does not address whether high-fiber diets reduce the risk of other types of cancer. 
C: The argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets. 
D: While the argument does not address whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables has different cancer-fighting properties than the fiber in cereals, this does not undermine the argument's conclusion that fiber consumption is linked to colon cancer rates. 
E: This choice presents a possibility that could undermine the argument's conclusion. If the other substances in fiber-rich foods are responsible for the lower rates of colon cancer, then the argument's conclusion that fiber consumption is the cause of the lower rates of colon cancer would be false. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The argument is that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer, and that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer while sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument does not discuss whether high-fiber diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
C: The argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not compare the cancer-fighting properties of the fiber in fruits and vegetables to the fiber in cereals, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
E: This choice is relevant to the argument because the argument assumes that the consumption of fiber is the only factor that affects the incidence of colon cancer, and overlooks the possibility that other substances in foods containing fiber may also play a role in preventing colon cancer.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known
  E: takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret. 
  The representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, which suggests that it is not a member of the trade group.
  
Analysis:
  The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed because the journalist assumes that the document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies is a comprehensive list of all members of the trade group. However, the journalist provides no evidence to support this assumption. Moreover, the fact that the trade group has long kept its membership list secret suggests that the journalist should be more skeptical of the representative's claim that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies that belong to a trade group. 
  A representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. 
  Bruch Industries is not listed in the document.
  
A: The argument is not about whether Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group or not. It is about whether Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group or not. This choice is irrelevant.
B: The journalist did present evidence that the document names every member of the trade group. The representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. This choice is incorrect.
C: The argument is not about how the trade group could have inadvertently sent out the document. This choice is irrelevant.
D: The argument is not about why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known. This choice is irrelevant.
E: The journalist takes for granted the accuracy of the representative's statement that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. The representative could be lying or mistaken. Therefore, the journalist's reasoning is flawed. This is the correct answer.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret. The trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, the journalist concludes that it is not a member of the trade group.
A: The journalist does not need to present a reason why Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group for the argument to be valid.
B: The journalist presented evidence that the document names every member of the trade group because the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
C: The journalist does not need to explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document for the argument to be valid.
D: The journalist does not need to present a reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known for the argument to be valid.
E: The journalist assumes that the statement by the trade group representative is accurate, but it is reasonable to assume that the representative is telling the truth, so the argument is not flawed in this way.
Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, yet both captive and wild leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy.
  C: This statement does not explain why captive leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as wild leatherbacks.
  D: This statement is also irrelevant because the passage is not concerned with the feasibility of establishing an artificial environment for leatherbacks.
  E: This statement is relevant because it suggests that the size of a leatherback is not a reliable indicator of its age, which could explain why captive leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as wild leatherbacks.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how leatherback sea turtles are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity that they would not encounter in the wild. However, the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is about the same whether it is in captivity or in the wild.
  A: This statement provides information about other large aquatic reptiles, but it does not address the apparent discrepancy between the survival rates of captive and wild leatherback sea turtles.
  B: This statement provides information about sea turtles in general, but it does not address the apparent discrepancy between the survival rates of captive and wild leatherback sea turtles.
  C: This statement provides some information about the causes of death of leatherback sea turtles in the wild, but it does not address the apparent discrepancy between the survival rates of captive and wild leatherback sea turtles.
  D: This statement suggests a possible reason why leatherbacks might not survive as well in captivity, but it does not explain why captive and wild leatherbacks have similar survival rates.
  E: This statement does not address the apparent discrepancy between the survival rates of captive and wild leatherback sea turtles.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with if they lived in the wild.
  The likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Action: Answer("C")
Explanation: The argument states that leatherbacks living in captivity are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with if they lived in the wild, yet the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild. If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then it helps to explain why captive leatherbacks have a similar life expectancy as those living in the wild despite the susceptibility to fatal diseases.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  
A: This option is irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy. 
B: This option is also irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy.
C: This option does not help to explain why leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether they are living in captivity or in the wild.
D: This option is also irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy.
E: This option might explain why leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether they are living in captivity or in the wild. If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, it is possible that captive leatherbacks that appear to be younger may actually be older and therefore closer to their maximum life expectancy, which would explain why captive leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as wild leatherbacks. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they can still reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy in captivity or in the wild.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy mentioned in the question stem.
  
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy mentioned in the question stem.
  
C: This statement explains that leatherbacks are killed by predators in the wild, but it doesn't resolve the discrepancy mentioned in the question stem.
  
D: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy mentioned in the question stem.
  
E: If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, it would be difficult to compare the age of the captive leatherbacks with that of the wild leatherbacks, which might help explain why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both settings.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they are still likely to reach their maximum life expectancy whether living in captivity or in the wild.
  
A: This statement does not help to explain why leatherbacks in captivity are likely to reach their maximum life expectancy even though they are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  
B: This statement provides information about the average life expectancy of sea turtles, but it does not help to explain why leatherbacks in captivity are likely to reach their maximum life expectancy even though they are susceptible to fatal diseases.

C: This statement provides information about the main reason why leatherbacks perish in the wild, but it does not help to explain why leatherbacks in captivity are likely to reach their maximum life expectancy even though they are susceptible to fatal diseases.

D: This statement provides information about the difficulty of establishing an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks, but it does not help to explain why leatherbacks in captivity are likely to reach their maximum life expectancy even though they are susceptible to fatal diseases.

E: This statement does not help to explain why leatherbacks in captivity are likely to reach their maximum life expectancy even though they are susceptible to fatal diseases.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity as they do in the wild.
  
A: This option is irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
B: This option is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
C: This option provides some information about the reasons for leatherbacks' death in the wild, but it does not help to resolve the discrepancy.
D: This option is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
E: This option provides some information about the reliability of determining the age of a leatherback, but it does not help to resolve the discrepancy.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.

The science journalist states that brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. The journalist also explains that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium in their atmospheres, while stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres. Since the journalist does not state that celestial objects without lithium are stars, it cannot be concluded that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun (A) or that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements (B). The journalist does not state that no celestial object with no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf (C), but rather the opposite - a brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed. The journalist does not state that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun (D), but rather that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres. Finally, the journalist does not state that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere (E). Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.

  B: If it takes players several weeks to complete the game, it is unlikely that they will be able to take advantage of the rebate offer by renting the game before purchasing it. This would suggest that more people may choose to purchase the game outright, justifying the publisher's prediction that sales will exceed expectations.
  C: The popularity of the publisher's games on the market is not relevant to the prediction made by the publisher.
  D: This statement suggests that players may not be interested in keeping the game after completing it, which would not support the prediction made by the publisher.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the prediction made by the publisher.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The publisher of a computer game has released a new game that can be purchased or rented. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game. Sales of the game are meeting expectations, and rentals are exceeding expectations.

A: This option is irrelevant to the prediction made by the publisher. Knowing that the game can be purchased directly from the publisher or from retailers does not help justify the prediction.
B: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then it may take a while before people are ready to purchase it, which would go against the publisher's prediction.
C: Knowing that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market is irrelevant to the prediction made by the publisher.
D: If most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, then they may not be interested in purchasing it, which would go against the publisher's prediction.
E: If some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, it does not help justify the prediction made by the publisher.

  A: This statement does not provide information about the sales or rentals of the game, so it cannot justify the publisher's prediction.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the prediction, as it does not provide information about the sales or rentals of the game.
  C: This statement suggests that the publisher has a strong reputation, which may contribute to increased sales, but it does not provide information about the sales or rentals of the game.
  D: This statement is not helpful to the publisher's prediction, as it suggests that people may not continue to play the game after completing it, which could reduce sales.
  E: This statement does not provide information about the sales or rentals of the game, so it cannot justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
A: This statement does not provide any relevant information that can justify the publisher's prediction.

C: The fact that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market does not directly support the prediction.
D: If most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, then they may be more likely to purchase the game after renting it once. This supports the publisher's prediction.
E: Some people buying and completing the game and then giving it away to a friend does not provide any relevant information that can justify the publisher's prediction.

  There is a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  Sales of the game are meeting expectations, but rentals are exceeding expectations.
  
A: This fact provides an additional way for customers to purchase the game, but it does not help to justify the publisher's prediction of increased sales.
B: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, it is unlikely that sales of the game will increase significantly in the short term, which does not support the publisher's prediction.
C: This information is interesting, but it does not help to justify the publisher's prediction of increased sales.
D: This fact suggests that the game may not have much replay value, which may not support the publisher's prediction of increased sales.
E: This fact suggests that some people may purchase multiple copies of the game, which could support the publisher's prediction of increased sales.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented, and renters who go on to purchase the game can get a rebate equal to the cost of one rental.
A: This option is not relevant to the publisher's prediction.
B: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then the rental period may not be enough for them to complete it, which could lead to an increase in sales as they may choose to purchase it instead.
C: This option does not provide any information specific to the new game, so it is not useful in justifying the publisher's prediction.
D: If most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, then they may choose to sell it or give it away to someone else, which would not contribute to an increase in sales. This option contradicts the prediction.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were sound and that the only reason they did not work was due to external factors, rather than considering the possibility that the theories themselves were flawed.
  A: The argument assumes that the only way architecture would have changed is if the valley people were invaded or there was a climatic change, without considering other possible reasons for architectural change.
  B: The argument assumes that because the workers promised not to strike, they must believe that the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut, without considering other possible reasons for their promise not to strike.
  C: The argument assumes that the only way the stock price would have doubled is if the company had sold its subsidiaries and purchased the new patent, without considering other possible reasons for the stock price not increasing.
  D: The argument assumes that the only way residents would show support for the rebels is if the rebels won the battle, without considering other possible reasons for their support.
  E: The argument assumes that the only way the accuracy of the forecasts would have risen is if the new equipment was worth the investment, without considering other possible reasons for the decrease in ratings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were wrong solely based on the fact that the inflation rate increased. It does not take into account other factors that could have affected the inflation rate.
A: This argument also makes a flawed assumption based on a lack of evidence. Just because the architecture in the valley remained the same, it does not necessarily mean that the valley people were never invaded.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the workers' promise not to strike is evidence that they do not fear a dramatic wage cut, which may not be the case.
C: This argument is similar to the argument above in that it assumes a cause-and-effect relationship without considering other factors that could have affected the stock price.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the residents' support for the rebels is evidence that the rebels won the battle, which may not be the case.
E: This argument is similar to the argument above in that it assumes a cause-and-effect relationship without considering other factors that could have affected the station's ratings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above claims that the economic theories of a party were flawed because the inflation rate increased instead of decreasing, which would have been the expected result if the theories were sound.
  A: The argument presents a conditional statement about changes in the valley's architecture based on two possible events, but it concludes that the valley people were never invaded based solely on the fact that the architecture remained the same. This is a non-sequitur.
  B: The argument presents a conditional statement about worker strikes based on a possible event, but it concludes that the workers do not believe the party will keep its promise of a wage cut based solely on the fact that they promised not to strike. This is a non-sequitur.
  C: The argument presents a conditional statement about the company's stock price based on a possible event, but it concludes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries based solely on the fact that the stock price did not increase. This is a non-sequitur.
  D: The argument presents a conditional statement about the residents' support for the rebels based on a possible event, but it concludes that the rebels won the battle based solely on the fact that the residents showed support. This is a non-sequitur.
  E: The argument presents a conditional statement about the accuracy of the television station's weather forecasts based on a possible event, but it concludes that the new equipment is no improvement based solely on the fact that the station's ratings decreased. This is similar to the argument above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument in the context states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, since the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark. 
A: The argument talks about the changes in the valley's architecture due to invasion or climatic change, but since the architecture remained the same, the argument concludes that the valley people were never invaded. 
B: The argument talks about the fear of workers striking if the opposition party wins and keeps its promise of cutting wages. However, since the workers have promised not to strike, the argument concludes that the workers think the party will not keep its promise.
C: The argument talks about the company's stock price doubling if it had sold its subsidiaries and purchased the new patent. However, since the stock price did not increase, the argument concludes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries.
D: The argument talks about the city residents showing support to the rebels for the last three days. Thus, the argument concludes that the rebels must have won the battle.
E: The argument talks about the new weather forecasting equipment's accuracy and the station's ratings. However, since the station's ratings decreased, the argument concludes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above assumes that the party's economic theories were sound, but it failed to implement its program properly. It then concludes that the party's economic theories were fur off the mark because the inflation rate increased.
Choices:
  A: This argument assumes that the architecture in the valley remained the same because the valley people were not invaded. It does not consider other reasons why the architecture may have remained the same.
  B: This argument assumes that workers will not strike because they promised not to strike. It does not consider other reasons why they may or may not strike.
  C: This argument assumes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries because the stock price did not increase. It does not consider other reasons why the stock price may not have increased.
  D: This argument assumes that the residents showed support for the rebels because the rebels won the battle. It does not consider other reasons why the residents may have shown support.
  E: This argument assumes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old because the station's ratings decreased. It does not consider other reasons why the ratings may have decreased.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument presented in the context is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were wrong because the inflation rate increased. However, there could be other factors that caused the inflation rate to increase, and the party's economic theories could have been sound.
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that if there had been an invasion or climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture. However, there could be other reasons why the architecture remained the same.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that workers will not strike simply because they promised not to, even if their wages are dramatically cut.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only way the stock price could have doubled is if the company had sold its subsidiaries and purchased the new patent, without considering other factors that could have affected the stock price.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that residents are showing support for the rebels because they won the battle and freed the jailed rebel leaders, without considering other reasons why residents could be showing support.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only way the accuracy of the station's forecasts could have risen is if the new weather forecasting equipment was worth the investment, without considering other factors that could have affected the accuracy of the forecasts.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that because the inflation rate increased, the economic theories of the party were not sound. However, this conclusion may not necessarily follow as there could be other factors contributing to the increase in the inflation rate.
A: The argument suggests that because there were no changes in the valley's architecture, the valley people must not have been invaded. This conclusion may not necessarily follow as there could be other factors contributing to the unchanged architecture.
B: The argument suggests that because workers have promised not to strike, they must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This conclusion may not necessarily follow as there could be other reasons why workers have promised not to strike.
C: The argument suggests that because the stock price did not increase in the last two years, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This conclusion may not necessarily follow as there could be other factors contributing to the stock price remaining the same.
D: The argument suggests that because city residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days, the rebels must have won the battle. This conclusion may not necessarily follow as there could be other reasons why residents are showing support for the rebels.
E: The argument suggests that because the station's ratings actually decreased, the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This conclusion may not necessarily follow as there could be other factors contributing to the decrease in ratings.
Action: Answer("C")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
The columnist argues that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights may not be passed into law if those who oppose it are very influential.

A: This principle does not support the columnist's reasoning as it implies that a bill favored by most people will become law within a few years only if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights. The columnist's argument is not about a bill's violation of basic human rights.
B: This principle supports the columnist's reasoning as it states that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law in a well-functioning democracy.
C: This principle is not relevant to the columnist's reasoning as it implies that a bill favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. The columnist's argument is about influential people opposing a bill.
D: This principle is not relevant to the columnist's reasoning as it implies that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights. The columnist's argument is about a bill that is not passed into law despite being favored by most people and not violating basic human rights.
E: This principle is not relevant to the columnist's reasoning as it implies that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights. The columnist's argument is about a bill that is not passed into law despite being favored by most people and not violating basic human rights.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the bill, which is favored by most people and does not violate basic human rights, will not be passed into law due to the opposition of influential people. The principle that best justifies this reasoning is B: "If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law." This principle acknowledges that a well-functioning democracy may still face obstacles to passing bills that are opposed by influential groups, even if they are favored by the majority.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist argues that the fact that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights is not passed into law due to the influence of a few opponents shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. Option B is the most relevant principle to justify the columnist's reasoning as it explains that a well-functioning democracy should eventually pass a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people. The fact that the bill is not passed suggests that the democracy is not functioning well. The other options do not address the issue of influential opponents and the difficulty of passing a bill despite the majority's support.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist's argument is that the bill will not be passed into law because it is opposed by influential people, despite the fact that it would benefit most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights. Therefore, the principle that justifies the columnist's reasoning is that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This is because a well-functioning democracy should be able to balance the interests of the majority and the minority, and ensure that the minority does not have undue influence over the legislative process.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed into law because the people who would be adversely affected are very influential, despite the fact that most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights. Therefore, the columnist implies that a democracy should pass bills that are favored by most people, even if those bills are opposed by influential people. Choice B captures this idea, stating that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist's argument is that the fact that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights is unlikely to be passed if it is opposed by influential people, shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. Choice B most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning by stating that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed due to the influence of a small but powerful group of people who would be adversely affected by it. Principle B most justifies the columnist's reasoning, as it states that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law in a well-functioning democracy. This principle implies that the fact that the bill has not been passed is an indication that the democracy is not well-functioning. None of the other principles directly address the issue of the influence of a small but powerful group of people on the passage of a bill.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed into law because those who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential, despite the fact that most people favor the bill and it does not violate anyone's basic human rights. Option B most justifies this reasoning by stating that if a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

According to the columnist, the bill is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights, but will not be passed due to the opposition of influential people. Option B states that if a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle helps to justify the columnist's reasoning.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist argues that the fact that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights is unlikely to be passed into law due to the influence of those who would be adversely affected by it is evidence that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. Choice B most closely aligns with the columnist's reasoning by stating that a well-functioning democracy would eventually pass a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the configuration of fingers in humans is not inherently better than other possible configurations. 
  A: This statement does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument that other configurations of fingers would be just as useful.
  B: This statement does not relate to the usefulness of different configurations of fingers.
  C: This statement does not relate to the usefulness of different configurations of fingers.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on any inherent superiority, but rather on our prejudices.
  E: This statement supports the biologist's argument that there are other possible configurations of fingers that could have evolved in humans, and that our current configuration is not inherently superior.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have been content with six fingers per hand if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  A: This statement does not provide any information about the contentment of humans with different configurations of fingers.
  B: This statement is too strong and it does not necessarily follow that humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement is too strong and it does not necessarily follow that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: This statement does not directly support the biologist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The biologist argues that the configuration of our fingers is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations, and that if humans had evolved from a fish with six phalanges in its fins, we would have been just as content with six fingers per hand. 
A: This statement does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
B: This statement actually weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness, which is contrary to the biologist's claim that the configuration of our fingers is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.
C: This statement supports the biologist's argument, but it does not strengthen it.
D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our current finger configuration is not based on objective evidence, but it does not strengthen the argument.
E: This statement supports the biologist's argument by providing an example of a fish species with a different number of phalanges in its fins, which suggests that different configurations are possible and not inherently better or worse. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
    The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers on each hand if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
    A: The contentment of everyone with the present configuration of fingers is not relevant to the argument.
    B: The argument is not about whether humans are content with two things of unequal usefulness.
    C: The argument is not about whether humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
    D: The argument suggests that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is due to our prejudices.
    E: If at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, it would strengthen the argument that humans could have had six fingers if we had descended from such a fish.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that humans could have been content with six fingers per hand if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins. The argument is based on the premise that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  A: This statement may or may not be true, but it does not address the argument that humans could have been content with six fingers per hand.
  B: This statement contradicts the argument that humans could have been content with six fingers per hand, as it claims that humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement supports the argument that humans could have been content with six fingers per hand, as it claims that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: This statement supports the argument that humans could have been content with six fingers per hand, as it claims that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: This statement does not strengthen or weaken the argument that humans could have been content with six fingers per hand, as it is already assumed that at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers and still be content with it. 
  A: The argument is not about everyone, but about humans in general. This choice doesn't strengthen the argument.
  B: The argument is not about unequal usefulness, but about different configurations. This choice is irrelevant.
  C: This statement is too absolute and not necessarily true. It doesn't strengthen the argument.
  D: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective criteria, but on our prejudices.
  E: This statement is interesting, but it doesn't strengthen the argument. It is not clear that the existence of a fish with six phalanges would have any impact on whether humans would be content with six fingers per hand.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the configuration of fingers in humans is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument and weakens it.
  C: This statement is a generalization that is not necessarily true and does not relate to the argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perceived usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not based on any inherent superiority, but rather on a subjective feeling.
  E: This statement is not directly relevant to the argument, but it does support the biologist's claim that there are fish with different phalanges in their fins, which strengthens the analogy used in the argument. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. 
  A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.

  E: This statement directly supports the biologist's argument that it is possible for a fish to have six phalanges in its fins. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The biologist is arguing that the number of fingers we have is not based on usefulness, but rather on the evolutionary history of our species. They are also arguing that humans would be just as content with a different number of fingers if that was the evolutionary path that we had taken.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's claim.
B: This statement is actually contradicting the biologist's argument, suggesting that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness, which is exactly what the biologist is arguing against.
C: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument and does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's claim.
D: This statement supports the biologist's claim that the usefulness of our current finger configuration is based on our prejudices rather than any inherent usefulness. However, it does not provide any evidence to support the idea that we would be content with a different number of fingers if that was our evolutionary path.
E: This statement supports the biologist's argument that there are fish species with a different number of phalanges in their fins, suggesting that different evolutionary paths are possible and that the number of fingers we have is not necessarily based on usefulness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that humans could be content with different configurations of fingers.
  A: This statement does not strengthen the biologist's argument because it does not address the possibility of humans being content with a different configuration of fingers.
  B: This statement weakens the biologist's argument because it suggests that humans would not be content with a configuration of fingers that is less useful than their present configuration.
  C: This statement does not strengthen the biologist's argument because it is too general and does not address the specific case of different configurations of fingers.
  D: This statement strengthens the biologist's argument because it suggests that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective criteria but on our prejudices.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument because it suggests that humans might have evolved differently if a fish with six phalanges in its fins had been our ancestor.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that the accountants might have made mistakes that were not discovered due to less scrutiny.
  B: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that someone outside the company could have accessed the records and embezzled the money.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television. - This could explain why the goals of movie executives are different from those of television executives, as the higher costs of producing a film may require the maximization of ticket sales to generate profits.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. - This explains why the goals of television executives are different from those of movie executives, as their profits come from sponsors who are looking to reach specific audiences rather than maximizing viewership.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

A: Riley parked his car in the center lane of Main Street and did not realize it could lead to a traffic accident. If a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car, he should not be blamed for it. This is consistent with the principle above.
B: Oblicek suggested to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business, but had no idea it was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. If the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it. This is consistent with the principle above.
C: Gougon served hollandaise sauce to his guests and had no reason to think it would make them ill, but was concerned that it might. If the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it. This is not consistent with the principle above.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine and did not know it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure.

Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals. 
  A: This weakens the geologist's argument because it shows that the absence of biomarkers does not necessarily mean that the fossil is not a source of petroleum.
  B: This is irrelevant to the argument.
  C: This strengthens the geologist's argument because it supports the idea that petroleum formation requires a long period of time.
  D: This is irrelevant to the argument.
  E: This weakens the geologist's argument because it provides an alternative source for the carbon deposits that petroleum could have formed from.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the theory of petroleum formation from deep carbon deposits has been refuted by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum, indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
  A: This weakens the argument that all fossils must have biomarkers, but it does not address the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  B: This statement is true but does not address the argument about the origin of petroleum.
  C: This statement supports the geologist's argument that petroleum could not have formed from deep carbon deposits in a short period of time.
  D: This statement does not address the argument about the origin of petroleum.
  E: This statement weakens the geologist's argument by providing an alternative source of carbon for petroleum, which is the fossilized remains of plants. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the dominant view that it is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
- To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that suggests biomarkers could be present in petroleum even if it is not formed from living material.

Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
Choice E weakens the geologist's argument because it suggests that biomarkers could be present in petroleum even if it is formed from non-living carbon deposits. If some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, then biomarkers from those plants could be present in petroleum even if the petroleum itself was not formed directly from those remains. This weakens the argument that the presence of biomarkers necessarily implies that petroleum is formed from living material.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The geologist argues that petroleum formation theory based on deep carbon deposits is refuted by biomarkers present in petroleum.
- A weakener for the geologist's argument would be something that suggests biomarkers could be present in petroleum even if it was formed from deep carbon deposits.

Analysis:
- Choices A and B do not address the issue of whether biomarkers could be present in petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits.
- Choice C strengthens the geologist's argument by suggesting that it would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum, making it less likely that petroleum could be formed from recent living material.
- Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
- Choice E does not necessarily weaken the argument because it is still possible for petroleum to have formed from deep carbon deposits even if some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.

Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: Choice A weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting that there can be fossils without biomarkers. This means that the absence of biomarkers in petroleum does not necessarily mean that it did not come from deep carbon deposits.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates that it formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  A: If fossils are found without biomarkers, it could suggest that petroleum could also form from such fossils.
  B: This statement does not provide any evidence to refute the geologist's argument.
  C: This statement supports the geologist's argument that it would take a long time for petroleum to form from fossilized remains.
  D: This statement does not provide any evidence to refute the geologist's argument.
  E: This statement weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting that some carbon deposits could form from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
- The geologist's argument is refuted by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
- We need to find an option that weakens the geologist's argument.

Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
Option E weakens the geologist's argument by providing an alternative source of petroleum formation - carbon deposits that were formed from the fossilized remains of plants. If some petroleum was formed from these carbon deposits, then it is possible that not all petroleum came from the fossilized remains of animals and plants, weakening the geologist's argument. The other options don't directly address the issue of the source of petroleum formation or don't provide an alternative explanation.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust.
  This view has been challenged by a theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist refutes this theory by pointing out the presence of biomarkers in petroleum, which indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  
A: This weakens the theory that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals, but it does not weaken the geologist's argument that there are biomarkers in petroleum.
B: This is irrelevant to the argument.
C: This actually supports the geologist's argument that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals, as it would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
D: This is irrelevant to the argument.
E: This weakens the geologist's argument that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals, as it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist is arguing that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust and that this is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: This weakens the argument only if the fossils discovered are of the same type as the ones that are believed to have formed petroleum.
  B: This does not address the argument about the formation of petroleum.
  C: This actually supports the geologist's argument that it would take a long time for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: This does not address the argument about the formation of petroleum.
  E: This weakens the argument by suggesting that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, not from deep carbon deposits.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: This weakens the geologist's argument that biomarkers indicate the past or present existence of a living organism, but it doesn't necessarily refute the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  B: This doesn't weaken or refute the geologist's argument.
  C: This supports the geologist's argument that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals, but it doesn't weaken or refute the geologist's argument.
  D: This weakens the geologist's argument that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth, but it doesn't necessarily refute the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  E: This weakens the geologist's argument that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth, but it doesn't necessarily refute the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The geologist argues that the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum. 
  A: This choice suggests that fossils exist without biomarkers, which does not weaken the geologist's argument.
  B: This choice is true, but it does not weaken the geologist's argument.
  C: This choice supports the geologist's argument.
  D: This choice is irrelevant to the geologist's argument.
  E: This choice suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which weakens the geologist's argument that petroleum did not form from living material.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This argument is flawed because it is possible that some people may not have developed harmful symptoms due to other reasons, such as having a strong immune system.
A: This argument is about moral rightness and interests, and it is not similar to the student's argument.
B: This argument is about the persuasive intent of advertisers and writers of fiction, and it is not similar to the student's argument.
C: This argument assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true. This argument is not similar to the student's argument.
D: This argument assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true. This argument is not similar to the student's argument.
E: This argument assumes that doctors not washing their hands is the only reason why the procedure may not be of much value in preventing disease, which is not necessarily true. This argument is not similar to the student's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The student's argument is that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This argument is flawed because exposure to a microorganism does not necessarily mean that a person has an immunity to infection by that microorganism.
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors are the only healthcare professionals who should be washing their hands, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The student's argument is that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. However, this argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason people do not develop harmful symptoms is due to immunity, when in fact there could be other reasons such as the microorganism being present in a non-virulent form or the individual's immune system being able to fend off the infection successfully.
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which may not be the case. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction do not try to persuade people that certain claims are true without providing any evidence to support this claim.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not always the case.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation without considering other factors that could be contributing to this decline.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors washing their hands less often than other health care professionals means that the procedure is not effective in preventing disease, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that exposure to a microorganism without developing any harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity. However, it is possible to be exposed to a microorganism without developing symptoms even if one is not immune to infection.
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, but not all actions that best serve the interests of everyone are just.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true because they are not advertisers.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not always the case.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, and does not consider other factors that may have contributed to this decline.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors washing their hands less often than other health care professionals means that hand washing is not effective in preventing disease.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The student's argument is flawed because having an immunity to a microorganism does not necessarily mean that the microorganism does not cause harmful symptoms in others. Also, exposure to a microorganism does not necessarily mean that a person has an immunity to it.
A: This argument is flawed because it is based on the false premise that everything morally right is just.
B: This argument is flawed because it is based on the false premise that writers of fiction are never advertisers.
C: This argument is flawed because it is based on the false premise that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes a causal relationship between excessive taxation and the decline in business expansions without providing any evidence to support this claim.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is based on the assumption that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms because they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. However, this assumption may not be true. Just because someone is not showing symptoms does not mean they have immunity. They may simply not have been exposed to a high enough dose of the microorganism to cause symptoms, or they may be carriers of the microorganism without showing symptoms themselves.
  
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which may not be true.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction do not try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which may not be true.

Knowledge: The student's argument is that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they have an immunity to the microorganism. This argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to a microorganism is the only way to develop an immunity to it. This is not necessarily true, as some people may have a natural immunity to certain microorganisms.
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.

Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is that if people do not exhibit harmful symptoms when exposed to staphylococcus, then they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  A: The argument pattern is that if X is true, then Y is true. Since not all Ys are true, the X is not true.
  B: The argument pattern is that if X is true for a certain group, then it is true for another group. Since the two groups are not the same, the X is not necessarily true for the second group.
  C: The argument pattern is that if X is true, then Y is true. Since Y is false, X is false.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  The study focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
A: This statement suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do less typing than those who have the least control over their own work. However, the study focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing, so this statement does not help to explain the study's findings.
B: This statement suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This could help to explain the study's findings, as it suggests that workers who feel a lack of control may be more susceptible to carpal tunnel syndrome due to the stress it causes.
C: This statement suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. While this may be true, it does not help to explain the study's findings.
D: This statement suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work. However, the study focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing, so this statement does not help to explain the study's findings.
E: This statement suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This could help to explain the study's findings, as it suggests that workers who have less control over their work may be more likely to perform repetitive motions that cause carpal tunnel syndrome.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  The study focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing. 
A: This statement, if true, would suggest that the workers with the most control over their own work do not develop carpal tunnel syndrome because they type less. This does not help explain why workers who report the least control are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.
B: This statement suggests that a lack of control over one's own work leads to emotional stress, which makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This helps explain the study's findings because it suggests that the workers with the least control over their own work develop carpal tunnel syndrome because they experience more emotional stress.
C: This statement suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This statement does not help explain why workers who report the least control are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.
D: This statement suggests that workers who rarely use keyboards and feel that they lack control over their own work are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. This statement does not help explain why workers who do similar amounts of typing and report the least control over their own work are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.
E: This statement, if true, would suggest that the workers with the least control over their own work develop carpal tunnel syndrome because they perform more repetitive motions other than typing. This does not help explain why workers who do similar amounts of typing and report the least control over their own work are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In marketing their products, drug companies often send gifts to physicians. According to a recent survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Question: If the survey results are accurate, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts.
  B: Most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians.
  C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  D: Some physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts.
  E: All physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the feeding mechanism of the dinosaur Diplodocus and suggests that it could not raise its long neck to eat high-growing vegetation. Instead, it suggests that Diplodocus could bend its neck downwards and even extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument is only about the neck structure of Diplodocus and does not compare it to modern animals.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument is only about the feeding mechanism of Diplodocus and does not discuss its vision.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument is only about the feeding mechanism of Diplodocus and does not discuss its brain or blood supply.
  D: This statement is not required by the argument. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation by bending its neck downwards and extending it below ground level, so it did not have to rely on rising up on its hind legs to access high-growing vegetation.
  E: This statement is required by the argument. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation by bending its neck downwards and extending it below ground level, so it assumes that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about Diplodocus's feeding behavior and how its neck structure would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation. Instead, it would have to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument about Diplodocus's feeding behavior and neck structure. 
  B: This statement is not mentioned in the argument about Diplodocus's feeding behavior and neck structure. 
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument about Diplodocus's feeding behavior and neck structure. 
  D: This statement is not necessary for the argument since the argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access food. 
  E: This statement is relevant to the argument since it suggests that Diplodocus had limited ways of accessing underwater vegetation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument suggests that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented raising its neck high enough to browse for high-growing vegetation. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

A: The argument doesn't depend on whether the same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument doesn't depend on Diplodocus's ability to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
C: The argument doesn't depend on whether a large animal such as Diplodocus could supply blood to an elevated brain.
D: The argument doesn't assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: The argument doesn't assume that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument discusses the feeding habits of Diplodocus and how the structure of its neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck and feeding on high-growing vegetation. The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

A: This answer is not relevant to the argument, which is specifically about Diplodocus and not modern ground-feeding animals.
B: This answer is not relevant to the argument, which is about the feeding habits of Diplodocus, not its vision.
C: This answer is not relevant to the argument, which is specifically about the feeding habits of Diplodocus and not the physiology of blood supply to the brain.
D: This answer is not necessary for the argument because the argument has already presented an alternative way that Diplodocus could access food without raising its neck.
E: This answer is relevant to the argument because it presents an alternative way that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation, which would weaken the argument's conclusion that Diplodocus fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the feeding habits of the dinosaur Diplodocus.
  Computer models have shown that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Diplodocus could, however, bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level, allowing it to access underwater vegetation.
  
A: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is about Diplodocus's neck structure, not the neck structure of other animals.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's ability to see.
C: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's brain or blood supply.
D: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument provides an alternative way Diplodocus could access vegetation.
E: This assumption is necessary because the argument assumes that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation, but it rules out the possibility that Diplodocus could access it by kneeling beside bodies of water or walking into them. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the feeding habits of the dinosaur Diplodocus.
  Computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the dinosaur from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  
Assumption: 
  An assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus could not have fed on high-growing vegetation by any other means.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that computer models have shown that Diplodocus couldn't raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation because of the structure of its neck bones, but it could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument and there is no need to make this assumption.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument and there is no need to make this assumption.
C: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument and there is no need to make this assumption.
D: This choice could be tempting, but it is not required by the argument. The argument only states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but it doesn't say that there were no other ways for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation.
E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument and there is no need to make this assumption.

Knowledge: The argument is about the feeding habits of the dinosaur Diplodocus. It is stated that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but it could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: The argument does not require this assumption. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones, not on the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not address Diplodocus's vision, so this assumption is not required.
C: The argument does not discuss the blood supply to Diplodocus's brain, so this assumption is not required.
D: This assumption is contradicted by the argument, which states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land.
E: This assumption is also contradicted by the argument, which states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The sample of people the speaker knows might be biased, and therefore, it is not necessarily representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument commits the fallacy of hasty generalization.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument is based on anecdotal evidence, which is evidence based on personal experiences or observations. The fact that everyone the arguer knows voted against the proposal is not sufficient evidence to conclude that most people voted against it. This is because the sample of people the arguer knows may not be representative of the general population. Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is based on the premise that the writer's personal experience is representative of the general population. However, personal experience is not a reliable way of determining how most people voted. The argument fails to consider that there may be other people who voted differently from what the writer expected. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. This is a classic case of hasty generalization, where the writer draws a conclusion based on inadequate evidence. Choice A accurately describes the flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument is based on the premise that everyone the author knows voted against the proposal, so the official results must be rigged. This is a flawed reasoning because it is possible that the author's social circle is not representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population, which is most accurately described by choice A. The other choices do not accurately describe the flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses anecdotal evidence (personal experience) to make a claim about the national referendum results, which is a logical fallacy. The fact that everyone the arguer knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. This is a classic example of selection bias. The correct answer is A because the argument is based on a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The argument assumes that the people the arguer knows are representative of the entire population, which is not a valid assumption.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")  
The flaw in the reasoning is that the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that "everyone I know voted against the proposal" is not a reliable indicator of how most people voted. Therefore, it is not a sound basis for rejecting the official results of the national referendum.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses anecdotal evidence (everyone I know) to refute official results, which is a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument commits the fallacy of hasty generalization. This flaw is best captured by choice A.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument is based on anecdotal evidence, which is unreliable because it only represents a small sample of people and is not necessarily representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the person knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people in the entire country voted against it. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it draws a conclusion based on insufficient evidence. Choice A best describes this flaw.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses anecdotal evidence from the people the arguer knows, which is not a representative sample of the general population. Just because everyone the arguer knows voted a certain way, it doesn't mean that the majority of the population voted that way. Therefore, the argument is flawed in its reasoning. Answer choice A accurately describes this flaw. Answer choice B describes circular reasoning, answer choice C describes an ad hominem argument, answer choice D describes a distinction without a difference, and answer choice E describes an argument from popularity.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses the evidence of a small sample size (the people the speaker knows) to make a claim about the general population. This is a classic example of the fallacy of hasty generalization. Therefore, the most accurate description of the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Inez: The book we are reading, The Nature of Matter, is mistitled. A title should summarize the content of the whole book, but nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy. Antonio: I do not think that the author erred; according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the conversation above?
Choices:
  A: Inez believes that the book should be called The Nature of Energy.
  B: Antonio believes that there are no differences between matter and energy.
  C: Inez and Antonio disagree on whether matter and energy are related.
  D: Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book.
  E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez believes that the current title of the book is mistitled because nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing energy, which is not mentioned in the title.
  Antonio thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
  
Reasoning:
  Neither Inez nor Antonio express the belief that the book should be called "The Nature of Energy" (A).
  Antonio does not believe that there are no differences between matter and energy (B).
  Inez and Antonio are in agreement that matter and energy are related, so they do not disagree on this point (C).
  There is no mention of disagreement on the overall value of the book (D).
  Inez believes that the title of the book should not mention matter without mentioning energy, which is supported by her statement that "A title should summarize the content of the whole book" (E).

Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  - Inez believes that the book's title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book. 
  - Antonio disagrees with Inez, believing that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning:
  - Inez's statement implies that the book should include both matter and energy in the title since both are discussed extensively.
  - Antonio's statement does not address the title of the book directly but instead discusses the relationship between matter and energy.

Therefore, the best answer is E, as Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez believes that the book's title is not descriptive enough as nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing a different subject: energy.
  Antonio thinks that the author did not err and that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
  
Reasoning: 
  Inez's statement suggests that she thinks the book's title should include both matter and energy, as she believes that the book's current title is misleading. Antonio disagrees with Inez's opinion and argues that matter and energy are related. Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. 
Choice A is incorrect because it only reflects Inez's opinion about the title of the book, but it does not reflect Antonio's opinion. 
Choice B is incorrect because Antonio does not believe that there are no differences between matter and energy; he believes that they are two facets of the same phenomenon. 
Choice C is incorrect because Inez and Antonio both agree that matter and energy are closely related. 
Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication in the conversation that Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez thinks that the book's title is mistitled because almost half of the book is devoted to discussing a closely related subject, energy.
  Antonio thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Explanation:
  Inez and Antonio are discussing the title of the book. Inez thinks that the book's title is mistitled because almost half of the book is devoted to discussing a closely related subject, energy. Antonio disagrees with Inez and thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Therefore, the most strongly supported option is E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez believes that the book's title is a misnomer because it does not adequately reflect the content of the book.
  Antonio believes that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. 

Reasoning: 
  Inez's statement suggests that the book's title should not focus on matter alone but should also mention energy. So, option A is not correct. 
  Antonio's statement suggests that he believes in the close relationship between matter and energy. However, it does not support option B. 
  The conversation does not suggest that Inez and Antonio disagree on whether matter and energy are related. So, option C is not correct.
  The conversation does not suggest that Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book. So, option D is not correct.
  Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. This is strongly supported by the conversation. Therefore, the correct choice is E.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez argues that the book's title is incorrect because it focuses only on matter and not on energy, which is also discussed in the book.
  Antonio disagrees with Inez, saying that matter and energy are related.
  
Answer:
  Inez suggests that if the book is to be named after one of the two topics, then it should be named in a way that includes both matter and energy. Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the conversation is that "Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy." Hence, the answer is E.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez claims that the book is mistitled because it does not include enough information about energy, and that the title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
  Antonio argues that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning: 
  Inez and Antonio are discussing whether the book's title is accurate. Inez thinks that the title is misleading because it does not mention energy, which is a significant portion of the book. Antonio disagrees; he thinks that the title is accurate because matter and energy are closely related. Therefore, the most strongly supported answer is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. This is because she thinks that the title is misleading and does not accurately reflect the content of the book. Answer choices A, B, C, and D are all incorrect because they are not supported by the conversation above.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez thinks that the book's title is mistitled because nearly half of the book discusses a closely related subject: energy. 
  Antonio thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon, so the title is appropriate.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. So, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine?
Choices:
  A: All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water.
  B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
  C: A washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine.

  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument and does not need to be assumed.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument and does not need to be assumed.
  C: This statement is too extreme and does not need to be assumed. The argument only talks about front-loading washers and does not make a claim about all washing machines.
  D: This statement is required for the argument because the argument assumes that the reason why ordinary powder detergent does not work well in front-loading washers is that it does not dissolve readily in them.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument and does not need to be assumed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument in the consumer magazine is that in order to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers must be used because ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.
A: The argument does not make any comparison between the amount of water used by top-loading washing machines.
B: The argument in the consumer magazine does not mention how readily a laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves in top-loading washers.
C: The argument in the consumer magazine suggests that using a laundry detergent specially formulated for a front-loading washer is necessary to get clothes really clean in that type of machine, but it does not make a general claim about washing machines.
D: This is a necessary assumption for the argument in the consumer magazine, as it is the basis for the claim that ordinary powder detergent does not work well in front-loading washers.
E: The argument in the consumer magazine is specifically about front-loading washers and does not make any claims about which type of washer gets clothes cleaner.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers because they use less water than top-loading washers. Therefore, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is necessary.
  A: The argument does not mention anything about the amount of water used by top-loading washing machines, so this assumption is not required by the argument.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the dissolving of detergent in top-loading washers, not front-loading washers.
  C: This statement is too extreme and goes beyond what the argument claims. The argument only says that a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is necessary to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine.
  D: This assumption is required by the argument as it is the basis of the argument. The argument states that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers, therefore, a detergent that dissolves readily is necessary to get clothes really clean.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the relationship between the amount of water used and the cleanliness of clothes, not the dissolving of detergent in front-loading washers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
Question: The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
  B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  C: My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house. Since anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it.
  D: My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Since no one who lives in a house both O'WIlS it and pays rent on it, it must be that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their heuse.
  E: Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Therefore, it must be that they pay rent on it.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument in the context is based on the premise that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. It then concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation. However, this conclusion may not be valid since there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise.
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that anyone who pays rent on a house does not own it, which may not be true.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that anyone who owns a house does not pay rent on it, which may not be true.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that anyone who owns a house does not pay rent on it, which may not be true.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that anyone who pays rent on a house does not own it, which may not be true.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that anyone who does not own a house pays rent on it, which may not be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the context is flawed because it assumes that not receiving a raise is equivalent to receiving a poor performance evaluation, which is not necessarily true.
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that paying rent on a house is equivalent to not owning it, which is not necessarily true.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that owning a house is equivalent to not paying rent on it, which is not necessarily true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that not paying rent on a house is equivalent to owning it, which is not necessarily true.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that paying rent on a house is equivalent to not owning it, which is not necessarily true.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that not owning a house is equivalent to paying rent on it, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the context is flawed because the fact that Lester has not received a raise does not necessarily mean that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the negation of the consequent is equivalent to the negation of the antecedent.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the negation of the antecedent is equivalent to the negation of the consequent.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the negation of the antecedent is equivalent to the negation of the consequent.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the negation of the antecedent is equivalent to the negation of the consequent.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the negation of the antecedent is equivalent to the negation of the consequent.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the context is that two events, receiving a poor performance evaluation and receiving a raise, are mutually exclusive.
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  A: The argument presents a similar structure, but the conclusion is different from the premise. The premise states that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, but the conclusion is that the next-door neighbors do not own the house.
  B: The argument presents a similar structure, but the conclusion is different from the premise. The premise states that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, but the conclusion is that the next-door neighbors do not pay rent on the house.
  C: The argument presents a similar structure, and the conclusion follows logically from the premise. The premise states that anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, and the conclusion is that the neighbors own their house because they have not paid rent on it.
  D: The argument presents a similar structure, but the conclusion is different from the premise. The premise states that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, but the conclusion is that the next-door neighbors pay rent on their house.
  E: The argument presents a similar structure, and the conclusion follows logically from the premise. The premise states that anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it, and the conclusion is that the neighbors pay rent on their house because they do not own it.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation. However, this conclusion is flawed because there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise.
  A: This argument is flawed because it concludes that since the neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it. However, the premise states that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, so it is possible that the neighbors do not own the house but also do not pay rent on it.
  B: This argument is also flawed because it concludes that since the neighbors own their house, it must be that they do not pay rent on it. However, the premise states that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, so it is possible that the neighbors do not pay rent on the house but also do not own it.
  C: This argument is flawed because it concludes that since the neighbors have not paid any rent on their house, it must be that they own it. However, the premise states that anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, so it is possible that the neighbors neither own nor rent the house.
  D: This argument is flawed because it concludes that since the neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it. However, the premise states that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, so it is possible that the neighbors own the house but also pay rent on it.
  E: This argument is also flawed because it concludes that since the neighbors do not own their house, it must be that they pay rent on it. However, the premise states that anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it, so it is possible that the neighbors neither own nor pay rent on the house.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the only reason Lester did not receive a raise is because he received a poor performance evaluation, but there could be other reasons.
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason someone would pay rent on a house is if they do not own it, but someone could own a house and still pay rent on it for various reasons.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason someone would not pay rent on a house is if they own it, but someone could live in a house they do not own and not pay rent on it for various reasons.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason someone would not pay rent on a house they live in is if they own it, but someone could live in a house they do not own and not pay rent on it for various reasons.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason someone would pay rent on a house they live in is if they do not own it, but someone could own a house and still pay rent on it for various reasons.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason someone would pay rent on a house they live in is if they do not own it, but someone could own a house and still pay rent on it for various reasons.

Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.

Justification: Option B involves an offer made in jest, which would not be considered legitimate and therefore would not result in a valid contract. This is in line with the principle stated in the context. Options A, C, D, and E do not directly address the legitimacy of an offer in the way that option B does.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  
A: The argument is valid based on the principle stated above. If Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer, then there was a valid contract.
B: The argument is valid based on the principle stated above. If Gus made the offer in jest, then the contract was not valid.
C: The argument is not valid. The principle of legitimate offer does not imply that Mindy will accept Frank's offer.
D: The argument is valid based on the principle stated above. If Hai's offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, then they have a valid contract.
E: The argument is not valid. The principle of legitimate offer implies that if Sal's offer was not legitimate, then there is no valid contract between them. However, the reason for the offer being illegitimate cannot be because it was made in jest, since that does not apply to Sal's situation.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract. 
  This argument is consistent with the principle, but it does not use the principle to justify its reasoning.

B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  This argument is consistent with the principle, and it uses the principle to justify its reasoning. 

C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  This argument does not relate to the principle stated above.

D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  This argument is consistent with the principle, and it uses the principle to justify its reasoning.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher is arguing that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  A: This answer choice does not really weaken the argument, since it reinforces the idea that stretching does not prevent injuries, regardless of the group being studied.
  B: This answer choice suggests that some joggers are not able to perform stretches, but it does not necessarily weaken the argument that stretching does not prevent injuries.
  C: This answer choice suggests that stretching may not help prevent the most common types of jogging injuries, but it does not necessarily weaken the argument that stretching does not prevent injuries.
  D: This answer choice suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries may be more likely to stretch, which could affect the results of the study. This could weaken the argument that stretching does not prevent injuries.
  E: This answer choice suggests that stretching can be helpful for some types of exercise, which does not necessarily weaken the argument that stretching does not prevent injuries during jogging.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.  
  A: This choice provides additional information but it does not weaken the researcher's argument.
  B: This choice weakens the researcher's argument by suggesting that those who were injured while jogging could not perform stretches, which could have prevented injuries.
  C: This choice weakens the researcher's argument by suggesting that stretching could help prevent injuries resulting from falls, collisions, and other mishaps.
  D: This choice provides additional information but it does not weaken the researcher's argument.
  E: This choice is irrelevant because it refers to other forms of exercise and does not address the researcher's argument about jogging specifically.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher compared two groups of joggers, those who stretched before jogging and those who didn't, and found that both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries. 
  A: This statement provides additional information about the study, but it doesn't weaken the medical researcher's argument.
  B: This statement suggests that the joggers who previously suffered injuries may have had difficulty performing stretches, which could have contributed to the lack of difference in the number of injuries between the two groups.
  C: This statement suggests that stretching may not have an impact on preventing jogging injuries because most jogging injuries result from mishaps on which stretching would have little effect.
  D: This statement suggests that the habit of stretching before jogging may be more prevalent among joggers who are more prone to injuries, which could affect the results of the study.
  E: This statement provides information about stretching and injury prevention in general, but it doesn't necessarily weaken the medical researcher's argument about stretching before jogging.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, and this is based on the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  A: This statement provides additional information about the rate of jogging injuries during the study, but it does not directly weaken the researcher's argument.
  B: This statement provides evidence that some joggers in the study were unable to perform stretches, which could have influenced the results and thus weakens the researcher's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that stretching may not be effective for preventing certain types of injuries, but it does not directly weaken the researcher's argument.
  D: This statement provides information about the habits of joggers, but it does not directly weaken the researcher's argument.
  E: This statement suggests that stretching may be effective for preventing injuries during certain forms of exercise, which weakens the researcher's argument that stretching is ineffective for jogging.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, based on the comparison of a group of joggers who stretch before jogging to a group of joggers who do not stretch before jogging, and found that both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
A: This option does not provide any information that would affect the conclusion of the medical researcher's argument.
B: This option provides an alternative explanation for why the group of joggers who stretch before jogging incurred roughly the same number of injuries as the group of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. If many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches, it is possible that those who stretch had more prior injuries and that is why their injury rate did not decrease. Therefore, this option weakens the medical researcher's argument.
C: This option suggests that most jogging injuries result from causes other than lack of flexibility, such as falls and collisions. However, it does not address the comparison between the joggers who stretch and those who do not stretch, and it does not weaken the medical researcher's argument.
D: This option provides information that is not relevant to the comparison between the joggers who stretch and those who do not stretch, and it does not weaken the medical researcher's argument.
E: This option provides evidence that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise, but it does not address the comparison between the joggers who stretch and those who do not stretch, and it does not weaken the medical researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is based on the comparison of two groups of joggers, one that stretches before jogging and one that does not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presented makes a generalization based on the enrollment of one class at Morris University.
  A: The argument is flawed because it assumes that the paintings displayed at the Metro Art Museum are owned by the museum. 
  B: The argument is flawed because it assumes that those who did not answer the poll question are opposed to increased spending on roads and parks.
  C: The argument is flawed because it assumes that the trees in the arboretum are representative of the entire San Felipe area.
  D: The argument is flawed because it assumes that the total number of vegetables available at Valley Food and Jumbo are the same.
  E: The argument is flawed because it assumes that the number of houses and condominiums offered for sale by Acme Realty are the same.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above makes a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the fallacy of the converse. It assumes that if "most of A are B, then most of B are A", which is not always true.
  A: The argument presents a different situation, comparing paintings on display with paintings owned by the museum. It does not follow the flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument.
  B: The argument presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, assuming that if more people prefer A over B, then most people are in favor of A and opposed to B.
  C: The argument presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, assuming that if most trees in the arboretum are of a certain species, then there must be more trees of that species in the area.
  D: The argument presents a different situation, comparing the availability of organic vegetables at two different stores. It does not follow the flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument.
  E: The argument presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, assuming that if Acme has photos of most of the houses but fewer than half of the condominiums, then Acme must have more houses for sale than condominiums.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Whether or not one can rightfully call a person's faithfulness a virtue depends in part on the object of that personas faithfulness. Virtues are by definition praiseworthy, which is why no one considers resentment virtuous, even though it is in fact a kind of faithfulness-faithfulness to hatreds or animosities.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous.
  B: Virtuous behavior is praiseworthy by definition.
  C: Behavior that emerges from hatred or animosity cannot be called virtuous.
  D: Faithfulness and resentment are obviously different, despite some similarities.
  E: Resentment should not be considered a virtuous emotion.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses how faithfulness can be considered virtuous depending on the object of that faithfulness. The conclusion drawn is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. This is most accurately expressed in choice A. While the argument does mention that virtuous behavior is praiseworthy and that resentment is not virtuous, these statements do not fully capture the overall conclusion of the argument. Choice D is also incorrect because the argument does not focus on the differences between faithfulness and resentment, but rather on how faithfulness can be virtuous or not depending on the object of that faithfulness.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness is a determining factor in whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. It also provides an example of how faithfulness to hatred or animosity is not considered virtuous, despite being a form of faithfulness. Therefore, the most accurate conclusion drawn in the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A best expresses this conclusion.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness determines whether it is virtuous or not. It also mentions that virtues are praiseworthy and that resentment cannot be considered virtuous, despite being a kind of faithfulness.

Choice A accurately expresses this conclusion.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses how it is not enough to simply label faithfulness as a virtue, as it depends on the object of that faithfulness. The argument then concludes that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Therefore, the best answer choice is A. Option B is too narrow, as it only captures one aspect of the argument. Option C is also too narrow, as it only refers to behavior based on hatred or animosity. Option D is incorrect, as the argument does not focus on the differences between faithfulness and resentment. Option E is also too narrow, as the argument does not only focus on resentment, but rather on faithfulness in general.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. The example of resentment is given to support this point. Therefore, the most accurate conclusion that can be drawn from the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A accurately expresses this conclusion.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness is a determining factor in whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. The author uses the example of resentment to illustrate this point.

Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous.

Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses how the object of faithfulness impacts whether or not it is considered virtuous. The author explains that virtues are praiseworthy, and that resentment is not considered virtuous despite being a type of faithfulness. Therefore, the overall conclusion is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness can be considered virtuous. Choice A most accurately expresses this conclusion.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:

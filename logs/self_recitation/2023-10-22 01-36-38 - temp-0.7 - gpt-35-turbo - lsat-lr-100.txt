### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement presents a study where blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas and most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. The advertisement concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: This choice criticizes the study design, suggesting that the conclusion may not apply to all the groups tested.
  B: This choice criticizes the assumption that the preference shown in the study would translate into actual purchases, especially if Sparkle Cola is much more expensive than the alternatives.
  C: This choice criticizes the generalization made in the advertisement, suggesting that there may be other colas that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This choice criticizes the conclusion drawn in the advertisement, suggesting that there may be other factors besides taste that influence consumers' preferences.
  E: This choice criticizes the scope of the study, suggesting that the conclusion may not apply to other types of beverages besides colas.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement is claiming that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the other five competing colas tasted.
  A: This criticism suggests that the study might not be representative of the larger group. However, the study was carefully controlled and the volunteers were divided evenly into five groups, which reduces the likelihood of this criticism.
  B: This criticism suggests that the study might not be applicable in a real-world setting. However, the advertisement is not making this claim and the criticism does not address the reasoning of the advertisement.
  C: This criticism suggests that the study might not be comprehensive enough. However, the advertisement is not making this claim and the criticism does not address the reasoning of the advertisement.
  D: This criticism suggests that there might be other factors that influence consumers' preferences. This criticism is relevant to the reasoning of the advertisement and is a valid criticism.
  E: This criticism suggests that the study might not be relevant to other beverages. However, the advertisement is not making this claim and the criticism does not address the reasoning of the advertisement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: This answer choice criticizes the generality of the study's conclusion by suggesting that it may not be true for each of the smaller groups.
  B: This answer choice criticizes the study's conclusion by suggesting that it takes something for granted that may not be true.
  C: This answer choice criticizes the study's conclusion by suggesting that another possibility has been overlooked.
  D: This answer choice criticizes the study's conclusion by suggesting that there may be other reasons for Sparkle Cola's popularity other than its taste.
  E: This answer choice is not relevant to the study's conclusion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, and most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  A: This could be a valid criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement, but it is not the most vulnerable one.
  B: This is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.
  C: This could be a valid criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement, but it is not the most vulnerable one.
  D: This is a valid criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement. The advertisement assumes that the preference for Sparkle Cola is due to its taste, but it overlooks other possible reasons why people may prefer Sparkle Cola.
  E: This is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of the five competing colas.
- Most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
- The advertisement concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.

A: This is a possible criticism, but it is not the most vulnerable one, as the study was carefully controlled and each group tasted a different cola.
B: This is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.
C: This is a possible criticism, but it is not the most vulnerable one, as the study only tested five colas, and it is not clear whether other colas would elicit a more favorable response.
D: This is a possible criticism, and it is relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement, as the study only focused on taste and did not consider other factors that may influence consumers' preferences.
E: This is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The advertisement claims that blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five other competing colas. 

A: This choice is not a valid criticism of the advertisement's reasoning because the advertisement states that the blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups, and each group tasted a different cola. Therefore, each group represents a random sample of the larger group of volunteers, and it's reasonable to assume that the results of each group can be generalized to the larger group.
B: The advertisement does not assume that most volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than any of the other colas tasted, so this choice is not a valid criticism of the advertisement's reasoning.
C: This choice is a possible criticism of the advertisement's reasoning because the study only compares Sparkle Cola to five other competing colas, so it is possible that another untested cola would elicit a more favorable response.
D: This choice is not a valid criticism of the advertisement's reasoning because the advertisement only claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested, regardless of the reasons for the preference.
E: This choice is not a valid criticism of the advertisement's reasoning because the study only compares colas and not other beverages.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The study is a controlled study where blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups and each group tasted a different cola. 
  Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  A: This is not a valid criticism because the study was conducted on the group level, not the individual level.
  B: This is not a valid criticism because the advertisement did not make any claims about buying behavior or price.
  C: This is a possible criticism as the study only compared Sparkle Cola to five competing colas, not all colas in the market.
  D: This is a possible criticism as the study did not control for factors such as packaging or price that may affect consumers' preferences.
  E: This is not a valid criticism because the study was only concerned with comparing colas.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted in a carefully controlled study.
  A: The study divided volunteers into five groups, with each group tasting a different cola. It is possible that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: The advertisement does not explicitly mention anything about the cost of Sparkle Cola or the other colas, so it cannot be criticized on the grounds of taking for granted anything about the cost.
  C: The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than "any" of the competing colas tested. Therefore, it cannot be criticized on the grounds of overlooking the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response.
  D: The advertisement does not consider any other reasons why people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas. Therefore, it is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds of overlooking the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons other than taste.
  E: The advertisement is not vulnerable to criticism on the grounds of not eliciting consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas, as the study only focused on colas.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested, based on a study where blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas.
  A: This criticism is not relevant to the reasoning presented in the advertisement, as the advertisement is not making generalizations about the entire group of volunteers, but only about the preference of most of the volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola over the competing cola tasted by their respective group.
  B: This criticism is not relevant to the reasoning presented in the advertisement, as the advertisement does not make any assumptions about the buying habits of the volunteers, but only claims that most of them preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  C: This criticism is relevant to the reasoning presented in the advertisement, as the advertisement only compares Sparkle Cola to the colas tested in the study, and does not consider the possibility that there may be other colas that elicit an even more favorable response from consumers than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This criticism is not relevant to the reasoning presented in the advertisement, as the advertisement only claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tasted, and does not make any claims about the reasons for this preference.
  E: This criticism is not relevant to the reasoning presented in the advertisement, as the advertisement is only concerned with the preference of blindfolded volunteers for Sparkle Cola compared to the competing colas tasted in the study, and does not make any claims about consumers' responses to other beverages.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement describes a study where blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  A: This criticism is not applicable to the study since the study did not make any generalizations about the entire group of volunteers.
  B: This criticism is not applicable to the study since the study did not make any assumptions about the cost or availability of Sparkle Cola.
  C: This criticism is valid since the study did not test all possible colas, and it is possible that an untested cola would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This criticism is valid since the study did not account for factors other than taste that may affect consumer preferences for Sparkle Cola.
  E: This criticism is not applicable to the study since the study only compared different colas and did not claim to elicit responses to all beverages.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument above is an example of conditional reasoning, where a conditional statement is given and a conclusion is drawn based on that statement. The argument uses a flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent, where the conclusion affirms the consequent of the conditional statement. This is a logical fallacy, as there can be other causes for the consequent than the given conditional statement.
A: This argument presents a valid conditional statement, but the conclusion does not affirm the consequent. It presents a new premise that can lead to the conclusion.
B: This argument presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, where the conclusion affirms the consequent of the conditional statement. The conclusion assumes that there are no other causes for the tire to wear out prematurely except for low tire pressure due to neglecting to check it regularly.
C: This argument presents a different pattern of reasoning, where the conclusion suggests a course of action based on a premise. It does not present a conditional statement.
D: This argument presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, where the conclusion affirms the consequent of the conditional statement. The conclusion assumes that there are no other causes for the tire to wear out prematurely except for low tire pressure due to neglecting to check it regularly.
E: This argument presents a different pattern of reasoning, where a second cause for the tire to wear out prematurely is introduced. It does not present a conditional statement that leads to affirming the consequent.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a conditional statement.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds.
  The argument states that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  There is no information to suggest that the presence of squirrels is the only factor that affects the number of birds attracted to a bird feeder.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument presented in the context is an example of conditional reasoning, where a conditional statement is presented followed by another statement or conclusion that is based on the conditional statement.
A: This argument presents a different conditional statement and a different conclusion, so it is not similar to the argument presented in the context.
B: This argument presents a similar conditional statement and a similar conclusion, but the order of the statements is different. The argument in the context is a conditional statement followed by a conclusion, while this argument is a conclusion followed by a conditional statement.
C: This argument presents a different conditional statement and a different conclusion, so it is not similar to the argument presented in the context.
D: This argument presents a similar conditional statement and a similar conclusion, but the argument includes an additional conditional statement that is not present in the argument in the context.
E: This argument presents a different conditional statement and a different conclusion, so it is not similar to the argument presented in the context.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument above uses an "if-then" statement to make a conclusion, but it fails to consider other factors that could affect the outcome. 
A: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it uses an "if-then" statement to make a conclusion. However, it does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument.
B: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it uses an "if-then" statement to make a conclusion. However, it does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument.
C: This argument does not have the same structure as the original argument. It does not use an "if-then" statement to make a conclusion.
D: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it uses an "if-then" statement to make a conclusion. However, it does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument.
E: This argument does not have the same structure as the original argument. It introduces a new factor that could affect the outcome.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument presents a conditional statement, which is a type of argument that relates a sufficient condition to a necessary condition. The argument suggests that if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, then squirrels will eat from it, and this will prevent birds from being attracted to the feeder. The argument implies that if a bird feeder has a protective cover, then squirrels will not eat from it, and birds will be attracted to the feeder.

A: The argument presents a cause-and-effect relationship between tire pressure and tire wear. The argument suggests that if a car owner checks tire pressure regularly, then the tires will not wear out prematurely. The argument implies that if the car owner neglects to check tire pressure regularly, then the tires will wear out prematurely. This argument is not similar to the argument presented in the question.

B: The argument presents a cause-and-effect relationship between tire pressure and tire wear. The argument suggests that if a car owner neglects to check tire pressure regularly, then the tire pressure will become too low, and the tires will wear out prematurely. The argument implies that if the car owner checks tire pressure regularly, then the tire pressure will not become too low, and the tires will not wear out prematurely. This argument is similar to the argument presented in the question.

C: The argument presents a cause-and-effect relationship between car owners neglecting to check tire pressure regularly and tires wearing out prematurely. The argument suggests that car owners check tire pressure regularly unless they are unaware of the consequences of neglecting to check tire pressure. The argument implies that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check tire pressure. This argument is not similar to the argument presented in the question.

D: The argument presents a cause-and-effect relationship between tire pressure and tire wear. The argument suggests that if a car owner neglects to check tire pressure regularly, then the tire pressure will become too low, and the tires will wear out prematurely. The argument implies that if the car owner neglects to check tire pressure regularly, then the tires will wear out prematurely. This argument is similar to the argument presented in the question.

E: The argument presents two causes of tire wear, low tire pressure, and driving on gravel roads. The argument suggests that if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, then keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer. The argument implies that if a tire is not often driven on gravel roads, then keeping its pressure from becoming too low will help it to last longer. This argument is not similar to the argument presented in the question.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument presents a conditional statement with a flawed pattern of reasoning that assumes the necessary condition as sufficient. 
  A: This argument presents a conditional statement with the necessary condition as the first part and the sufficient condition as the second part. It is not similar to the argument in the question.
  B: This argument presents a conditional statement with the necessary condition as the first part and the sufficient condition as the second part. It is similar to the argument in the question but not the same.
  C: This argument presents a causal relationship with a flawed pattern of reasoning that assumes sufficiency from necessity. It is not similar to the argument in the question.
  D: This argument presents a conditional statement with the necessary condition as the first part and the sufficient condition as the second part. It is similar to the argument in the question but not the same.
  E: This argument presents two causes that are insufficient to support the conclusion. It is not similar to the argument in the question.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument above is flawed because it commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent. That is, the argument wrongly concludes that if the bird feeder lacks a protective cover, it will not attract many birds.
  A: The argument is not similar to this one because it is a valid argument.
  B: The argument is similar to this one because it also commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent. It wrongly concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: The argument is not similar to this one because it is about persuading car owners to check their tire pressure regularly. It is not an argument with a flawed pattern of reasoning.
  D: The argument is similar to this one because it also commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent. It wrongly concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  E: The argument is not similar to this one because it is about the effect of often driving a tire on gravel roads, not about a flawed pattern of reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above uses a conditional statement and a negative conditional statement to conclude that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  A: The argument above is different from this argument because it concludes that regularly checking the tire pressure will prevent the tires from wearing out prematurely.
  B: The argument above is similar to this argument because it concludes that neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly will cause the tire to wear out prematurely.
  C: The argument above is different from this argument because it concludes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: The argument above is similar to this argument because it concludes that neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly will cause the tire to wear out prematurely.
  E: The argument above is different from this argument because it concludes that keeping the tire pressure from becoming too low will not help the tire to last longer if it is often driven on gravel roads.
Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not. We need to find an option that weakens this argument. 

A: This option does not address the argument, but rather presents a general statement about people's perception of danger.
B: This option goes against the argument by stating that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters.
C: This option supports the argument by stating that people who watch a below-average amount of television have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
D: This option weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well-informed in some way other than by watching television.
E: This option does not address the argument, but rather suggests an alternative explanation for why people may watch an above-average amount of television. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think they will be victims of a natural disaster than people who do not watch an above-average amount of television.
  
A: This statement does not weaken the argument. It acknowledges that people generally overestimate the dangers of the world, but it does not address the connection between television watching and the overestimation of natural disaster risks.
  
B: This statement would weaken the argument if it were true. However, it is unlikely to be true, as there is no clear reason why television watching would affect a person's likelihood of living in an area prone to natural disasters.
  
C: This statement would weaken the argument if it were true. If people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a more accurate idea of the risks of natural disasters, it would suggest that television watching is the cause of the overestimation of natural disaster risks.
  
D: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that there is an alternative explanation for why some people are well-informed about natural disaster risks. If people who are well-informed did not become so by watching television, it suggests that television is not the cause of the overestimation of natural disaster risks.
  
E: This statement does not address the argument. It suggests a correlation between natural disaster risks and television watching, but it does not address whether television watching causes people to overestimate natural disaster risks.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than those who do not.
  A: This statement, even though true, does not weaken the argument.
  B: If a person who watches an above-average amount of television is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, this statement weakens the reasoning of the argument.
  C: If people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, this statement supports the argument.
  D: If people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, this statement weakens the reasoning of the argument.
  E: If a person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not, this statement does not weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument provides evidence from a recent study that found people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  
A: This statement weakens the scope of the argument, but it does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks.
B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
C: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that people who watch a below-average amount of television are more likely to have an accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of a natural disaster.
D: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that there are other ways to become well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. It provides evidence that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than people who do not. 
A: This statement does not address the argument about the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks, so it is not the best answer.
B: If people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, then the study's findings about the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks may not be accurate. Therefore, this statement weakens the argument.
C: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that people who watch less television are more accurate in their risk assessments.
D: This statement does not address the argument about the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks, so it is not the best answer.
E: This statement provides a possible alternative explanation for the study's findings, but it does not necessarily weaken the argument. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that watching an above-average amount of television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  A: This information does not weaken the argument as it suggests that the overestimation of risks is not solely due to watching television.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. It does not address the effect of watching television on people's perception of risk.
  C: This statement supports the argument as it suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of natural disasters.
  D: This statement weakens the argument as it suggests that there are other ways to become well-informed about the risks posed by natural disasters, which indicates that watching television is not the only factor that contributes to overestimating the risks.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. It does not address the effect of watching television on people's perception of risk.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
The argument claims that watching an above-average amount of television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
A: This statement does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating the risks of natural disasters. This statement is too general and does not weaken the argument.
B: This statement contradicts the argument. It claims that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area prone to natural disasters, which suggests that watching television does not lead to overestimation of natural disaster risks.
C: This statement supports the argument. It claims that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
D: This statement suggests that there is another way to become well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters, which weakens the argument that the only way people become informed about these risks is by watching television.
E: This statement does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating the risks of natural disasters. This statement is also the opposite of B, which weakens its relevance to the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument cites a study that found a correlation between watching an above-average amount of television and people's likelihood to think that they will be victims of natural disasters.
Choices:
  A: This statement does not address the relationship between television watching and people's likelihood to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster. It is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This statement contradicts the argument by suggesting that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters. Therefore, it weakens the reasoning above.
  C: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. Therefore, it does not weaken the reasoning above.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist concludes that lizards, such as chameleons, bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Critics doubt the results of the study because of its small sample size.
  The author's professional reputation and past work are mentioned in support of the study's credibility.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
The biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The argument appeals to the author's credibility as evidence of the study's reliability, but it does not address the specific criticisms of the study's methodology or its small sample size. The argument also assumes that the behavior of six individual chameleons can be generalized to all lizards, which is a potential weakness. However, the argument is not vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production or that it focuses on the author rather than the study itself.
Response 1:
Knowledge: The biologist argues that the criticism of the study's small sample size is incorrect because the author is well-regarded and has done excellent work for years. 

A: The biologist does not generalize the behavior of chameleons to all lizards. 
B: The biologist does not address how chameleons regulate vitamin D production. 
C: The biologist does focus on the author's credentials, but that is not the main point of the argument. 
D: The biologist does not address whether the study's critics have relevant expertise. 
E: The argument does not hold the author to a higher standard than the study's critics. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's argument states that a study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. The sample size was small, but the study's author is well-regarded in the profession and has been doing excellent work for years.
  A: The biologist's argument does not generalize the behavior of chameleons to all lizards, only to lizards such as chameleons.
  B: The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun; it states that basking in the sun helps regulate their vitamin D production.
  C: The argument does mention the study's author's professional reputation, but it is not the main focus of the argument. The argument is about the validity of the study's results.
  D: The argument does not address whether the study's critics have relevant expertise or not.
  E: The argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's argument claims that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D, based on a study of six individual chameleons.
  A: The argument focuses on chameleons, not lizards as a whole.
  B: The argument explains that chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
  C: The argument mentions the author's professional reputation, but this is not the main focus of the argument.
  D: The argument does not address whether the study's critics have relevant expertise.
  E: The argument does not make a comparison between the standards applied to the author and to the critics.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's argument presents a study that concludes that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. 
  Critics of the study doubted its results on the grounds that its sample size was very small. 
  The biologist defends the study's results by claiming that the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  
A: The biologist's argument does not take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole. The argument only presents a study that concludes that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  B: The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun. The argument states that a careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  C: The argument does focus some of its attention on the study's author, but this is not the main vulnerability of the argument. 
  D: The argument does not fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise. The argument only defends the study's author by stating that he is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  E: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it relies on the reputation of the study's author to defend the study's results without addressing the critics' main concern of the small sample size of the study. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The biologist's argument presents a conclusion that the critics of his study are wrong to doubt its results. He supports his argument by stating that he conducted a careful study of six individual chameleons which concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Additionally, he mentions that the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
A: This is not a criticism of the biologist's argument.
B: The argument does not discuss how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun, but this is not a criticism of the argument.
C: The argument does mention the study's author and their credentials, but this is not the main focus of the argument, and it is not a criticism of the argument.
D: The argument does not address the expertise of the study's critics, so this is not a criticism of the argument.
E: This choice is the closest to a criticism of the argument because the biologist appears to hold the study's author to a higher standard than the study's critics. However, this is not the main focus of the argument, and it is not a significant vulnerability in the reasoning.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the critics of the study are wrong to doubt its results, despite its small sample size, because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years. The study concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  
  A: The argument does suggest that the behavior of the six individual chameleons can be applied to lizards as a whole, but this is not the main point of argument.
  B: The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun. The argument states that the study concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  C: The argument does focus on the study's author, but this is not inherently a problem. The argument is that the author's reputation and track record should lend credibility to the study's results, despite its small sample size.
  D: The argument does not address whether the study's critics have relevant expertise or not, so this is not a vulnerability in the argument.
  E: This is a plausible criticism of the argument. The argument holds the study's author to a high standard, suggesting that the author's reputation and track record should lend credibility to the study's results, while not holding the study's critics to the same standard. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that the study's critics are wrong to doubt its results, despite the small sample size, because the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years. 
  A: The biologist does conclude that the behavior of six individual chameleons is representative of lizards such as chameleons as a whole.
  B: The biologist suggests that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D, but does not provide further explanation.
  C: The biologist does focus on the study's author, but only to defend against the critics' doubts about the study's validity.
  D: The biologist does not provide evidence of the study's critics' expertise.
  E: The biologist does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than the study's critics.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The biologist studied 6 individual chameleons and concluded that they bask in the sun to regulate their vitamin D production.
- Critics of the study doubt its results due to the small sample size.
- The author of the study is well regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.

Reasoning:
- The biologist's argument defends the study against the criticism of its small sample size by relying on the author's professional reputation.
- However, the argument does not address the criticism that the study's sample may not be representative of all lizards, which is a valid concern.
- Therefore, the reasoning is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

The biologist's argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The argument appeals to the authority of the study's author, implying that the study's results are trustworthy simply because the author is well-regarded in their profession and has been doing good work for years. This is a form of ad hominem argument and does not address the actual criticisms of the study. Additionally, the argument fails to address the sample size concern raised by the critics.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.

Knowledge: 
  The psychologist believes that sedatives should not be prescribed to insomniacs and that psychotherapy is a more appropriate treatment.
  A: This describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning, as the argument does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress.
  B: This describes a possible flaw in the psychologist's reasoning, as it does not consider other potential treatments for insomnia not caused by stress.
  C: This describes a possible flaw in the psychologist's reasoning, as there may be cases where psychotherapy is not effective in treating stress.
  D: This describes a possible flaw in the psychologist's reasoning, as sedatives could potentially help insomniacs cope with stress.
  E: This describes a possible flaw in the psychologist's reasoning, as the cases of insomnia psychologists treat may not be representative of all cases of insomnia.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  A plan was implemented to systematically record staff errors that led to patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased since the implementation of the plan.
  The argument claims that the knowledge of being monitored made the staff more meticulous in carrying out their duties.
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient. This information is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not strengthen or weaken the argument.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question. This information weakens the argument as it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not have been solely due to the plan.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not. This information is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not strengthen or weaken the argument.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. This information strengthens the argument by suggesting that the knowledge of being monitored was a causal factor in decreasing patient injuries.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors. This information is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not strengthen or weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  A year ago several regional hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors to reduce patient injuries resulting from staff errors. 
  Since then, the incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals.
  The argument is that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Choices:
  A: This statement provides additional information on how the hospitals dealt with staff errors before the implementation of the plan, but it does not relate to the argument that the implementation of the plan reduced the incidence of patient injuries.
  B: If a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also experienced a decrease in the incidence of patient injuries, it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be solely due to the implementation of the plan.
  C: If the plan did not record staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not, it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be solely due to the implementation of the plan.
  D: If the decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, it strengthens the argument that the implementation of the plan reduced the incidence of patient injuries because it suggests that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  E: This statement provides additional information on how the hospitals dealt with staff errors under the plan, but it does not relate to the argument that the implementation of the plan reduced the incidence of patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the knowledge of being monitored led to the hospitals' staff members being more careful in carrying out their patient-care duties, which in turn decreased the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
  A: This statement provides additional information about the hospitals' policies regarding staff errors but does not strengthen the argument.
  B: This statement is about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan. It does not provide any information about the hospitals that did participate in the plan, and thus does not strengthen the argument.
  C: This statement weakens the argument because it implies that the plan did not record all staff errors that caused patient injuries.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in the incidence of injuries was a result of the staff becoming more careful in carrying out their duties due to the knowledge that their errors were being monitored.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the effect of the plan on the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors led to a decrease in patient injuries resulting from staff errors at regional hospitals.
  A: The argument does not mention anything about a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The argument focuses on the hospitals that participated in the plan, not a regional hospital that did not participate. 
  C: The argument states that the plan was implemented to systematically record all staff errors that caused patient injuries.
  D: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that the knowledge that staff errors were being recorded led to the decrease in patient injuries.
  E: The argument does not mention anything about the consequences of staff errors that caused injuries to patients under the plan.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  A: The argument does not address the hospital's policies regarding investigating staff errors that cause life-threatening injuries to patients.
  B: The argument is specifically about the regional hospitals that implemented the plan; other hospitals are not relevant to the argument.
  C: The argument states that the plan called for the recording of all staff errors resulting in patient injuries, so this statement weakens the argument.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in injuries was a direct result of the staffs becoming more meticulous after the implementation of the plan.
  E: The argument does not address the hospitals' policies regarding disciplinary action for staff errors that cause patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  A: The hospitals had a policy of investigating staff errors that cause life-threatening injury to a patient before the plan was implemented.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not record staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, staff members who made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, then it would support the argument that the knowledge of the monitoring caused the staff to become more meticulous and decrease the incidence of injuries.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that the systematic recording of staff errors has caused a decrease in the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors. 
  A: The policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient is not directly related to the recording of all such errors.
  B: The decrease in patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan might have been caused by other factors.
  C: The plan not calling for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not is not directly related to the conclusion.
  D: If the decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, it would strengthen the argument that the knowledge of being monitored was the reason for the decrease.
  E: The reprimands for the first errors of staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients does not directly relate to the conclusion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors resulted in a substantial decrease in patient injuries, presumably because the staff became more meticulous in carrying out their duties.
  A: This statement is about the hospitals' policies before the plan was implemented, and it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in injuries may have been due to other factors, not just the implementation of the plan.
  C: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan may not have captured all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in injuries was a direct result of the staff becoming more meticulous in carrying out their duties because they were aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
  E: This statement is not directly relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Several regional hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors in order to reduce patient injuries resulting from staff errors. Since then, the incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals. The argument states that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
A: This statement talks about a policy that already existed before the implementation of the plan. It does not provide any information that strengthens the argument that the knowledge of recording errors made the staff more meticulous.
B: This statement talks about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan, hence it is irrelevant to the argument.
C: This statement weakens the argument because it shows that the plan was not comprehensive and did not cover all errors.
D: If the decrease in incidence of injuries started after the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, it would strengthen the argument that the knowledge of monitoring errors made the staff more careful.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at the hospitals that implemented the plan to systematically record staff errors.
  - The decrease in patient injuries is attributed to the staff becoming more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties due to the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored.
Choices:
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it does not provide any information that can strengthen or weaken the argument.
  B: This statement weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the decrease in patient injuries at the hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  C: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan may not have captured all the errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument by providing evidence that the decrease in patient injuries was likely due to the staff becoming more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties because of the knowledge that their errors were being closely monitored.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it does not provide any information that can strengthen or weaken the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. The CEO's argument assumes that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution, but this assumption may not be true. Therefore, the argument is flawed. Choice A accurately describes this flaw.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The CEO's reasoning is flawed because he assumes that there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution, without any evidence to support that claim. This is an assumption that takes for granted a situation that may not be true. Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. Choice A is the best answer.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")

The CEO's argument is flawed because he is generalizing too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. While it may be true that the corporation is doing all it can to pollute less, it does not necessarily mean that it is doing all it can to be environmentally responsible. The CEO's argument also assumes that all environmentally responsible corporations are those that do all they can to pollute less, which is not necessarily true.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The CEO's argument is based on the assumption that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution, and therefore the company is doing all it can to pollute less. However, this assumption is flawed because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed in the future. Therefore, choice A correctly identifies the flaw in the CEO's argument. Choices B, C, D, and E are not directly related to the flaw in the CEO's argument, and can be eliminated.
Response 4:
Knowledge: The CEO is arguing that the company is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did, and there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
A: This answer choice is correct because the CEO assumes that it is impossible to develop production methods that do not produce pollution, which is not necessarily true.
B: This answer choice is incorrect because it does not describe a flaw in the CEO's reasoning.
C: This answer choice is incorrect because the CEO is arguing against a specific criticism of the company's environmental responsibility.
D: This answer choice is incorrect because the CEO does not make this assumption in their argument.
E: This answer choice is incorrect because the CEO acknowledges that their current production methods pollute less than before, and there may not be any methods that produce no pollution.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

The CEO's argument assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. This assumption takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. Therefore, the reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. Choice A accurately describes this flaw in the argument.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The CEO is defending the corporation against a criticism that it is not environmentally responsible. The CEO argues that the corporation's current production methods pollute significantly less than its old methods and that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
A: This choice is relevant to the argument in that it suggests the CEO is assuming that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. However, the argument is not explicitly assuming this; it is only stating that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
C: This choice is relevant to the argument in that the CEO is making a generalization from a specific criticism to a class of criticisms. The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because it pollutes less than it used to and that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. However, this argument does not address other criticisms that may be leveled against the corporation.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
E: This choice is relevant to the argument in that it suggests that the CEO is assuming that there are no production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now. However, the argument is not explicitly assuming this; it is only stating that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The CEO argues that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did. They also claim that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
A: The CEO does assume that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed, but this is not the main flaw in their argument.
B: The CEO does not discuss different causes having similar effects, so this is not the main flaw in their argument.
C: The CEO does generalize too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms, but this is not the main flaw in their argument.
D: The CEO does assume that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded, but this is not the main flaw in their argument.
E: The main flaw in the CEO's argument is that they assume there are no methods that produce less pollution than their current methods, which ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")

The CEO's argument is flawed in that it generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. The CEO states that the corporation has been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation and then goes on to argue that environmentally responsible corporations are those that do all they can to pollute less. This is a hasty generalization because it assumes that all criticisms of the corporation's environmental responsibility are based on the production methods used to reduce pollution, when in fact there may be other issues that have not been addressed.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. The CEO claims that the company's current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods, and there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution. However, this assumes that no new methods will be developed in the future that could eliminate pollution altogether. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it makes an assumption without providing any evidence to support it.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile
  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered
  E: the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Larew and Mendota are discussing the change in income of the lowest and highest income quintiles over the last ten years.
  Larew argues that the economic prosperity of the lowest quintile increased relative to the highest quintile's because the percentage increase in average income was higher for the lowest quintile.
  Mendota disagrees with Larew's argument, stating that even though the percentage increase in average income was higher for the lowest quintile, the absolute amount of the increase was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Larew and Mendota are discussing the change in average income of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest income quintile over the last ten years.
  A: Larew and Mendota both agree that the percentage change in average income of the lowest income quintile was higher than that of the highest income quintile.
  B: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether the absolute amount of the increase in average income was greater for the highest quintile than for the lowest quintile.
  C: Larew and Mendota are comparing changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile. They are not discussing whether this comparison should be made.
  D: Mendota disagrees with Larew's claim that the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile increased relative to the highest quintile's. Therefore, Mendota does not believe that there were no improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the last ten years.
  E: This is a point of disagreement between Larew and Mendota over the accuracy of measuring changes in economic prosperity. Larew believes that the percentage increase in average income is a more accurate measure of change, while Mendota believes that the absolute amount of the increase in average income is a better measure of change. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Larew and Mendota are discussing the relative increase in average income of the lowest income quintile and the highest income quintile over the last ten years.
  Larew argues that the percentage increase in average income of the lowest quintile was higher than that of the highest quintile, which suggests their relative economic prosperity increased.
  Mendota disagrees, arguing that the absolute increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile, which is a different way of measuring economic prosperity.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Larew argues that the lowest quintile had a higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did the highest quintile, so their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission is proposing to regulate wetland development in Figoria by requiring the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect endangered species.
The Figorian Development Commission opposes this regulation in favor of allowing wetland development in Figoria to promote economic growth.
 
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than any other type of development. This is not relevant to the argument.
B: This assumption is relevant to the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission because it assumes that replacement wetland habitats will be effective in protecting endangered species.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that in nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated. This is not relevant to the argument.
D: This assumption is relevant to the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission because it assumes that Figorian regulation of wetland development has been effective in protecting and preserving wildlife.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species. This is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife. 
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that they have a right to govern their own resources.
  
Asumptions:
  A: The argument does not depend on the assumption that more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The argument depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands to justify the need for constructing replacement wetlands.
  C: The argument does not depend on the assumption that in nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: The argument depends on the assumption that Figorian regulation of development has protected and preserved wildlife in the past to justify the need for future regulation of wetland development.
  E: The argument does not depend on the assumption that the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
B: If the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will not survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, then the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is weakened. Therefore, this is an assumption on which the argument depends.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that in nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
D: This assumption supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not necessary for the argument to hold.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the assumption that the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that to protect wildlife, wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  The options describe assumptions that support the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
  
Analysis:
  A is incorrect because the argument doesn't make any comparison with other types of development.
  B is correct because the argument assumes that the replacement wetlands will be adequate to support the species that inhabit natural wetlands.
  C is incorrect because the argument doesn't make any distinction between industrialized and agricultural nations.
  D is incorrect because the argument doesn't cite any past examples of Figorian regulation of development.
  E is incorrect because the argument doesn't make any comparison with other endangered species.

  D: This assumption supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not a necessary assumption.
  E: This assumption is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission is advocating regulating wetland development in order to protect wildlife by ensuring that wetland habitats are not reduced. They propose that new wetland habitats should be created to offset any development. In contrast, the Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria should be allowed to develop their wetlands for growth since other countries have done so.

A: This statement is not related to the argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission. The argument is about the need to regulate wetland development in Figoria in order to protect wildlife, not about the relative threat to wildlife posed by different types of development. 

B: This statement is a necessary assumption of the Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument. The Commission's argument is that new wetland habitats should be created to offset any development in order to protect wildlife. This assumption is necessary to support the conclusion that regulating wetland development will protect wildlife. 

C: This statement is not related to the argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission. The argument is about the need to regulate wetland development in Figoria in order to protect wildlife, not about the need to regulate wetland development in agricultural nations.

D: This statement supports the argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not a necessary assumption of their argument. The argument is about the need to regulate wetland development in Figoria in order to protect wildlife, not about the effectiveness of past regulations.

E: This statement is not related to the argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission. The argument is about the need to regulate wetland development in Figoria in order to protect wildlife, not about the severity of the threat to Figorian wetland species.

Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife and prevent net reduction of wetlands. 
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the number of species endangered by wetland development compared to other types of development. This is out of scope and not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does depend on the assumption that species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. Without this assumption, the argument that development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them falls apart.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is not concerned with wetland development regulation in nations that are primarily agricultural. This is out of scope and not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is not dependent on the past performance of Figorian regulation of development. This is out of scope and not relevant to the argument.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is not dependent on whether the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species. This is out of scope and not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission states that wetland development should be regulated and that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. This would ensure that there is no net reduction of wetlands and that the species that inhabit them are not threatened.
A: The argument does not depend on the number of species endangered by wetland development compared to other types of development.
B: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the replacement wetlands will be able to support the same species as natural wetlands.
C: The argument is not concerned with wetland development in primarily agricultural nations.
D: This assumption supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not necessary for the argument to hold.
E: The argument is not dependent on the severity of threat to the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that to protect wildlife, future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.
The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth. They believe that they have as much right to govern their own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.

A: The argument does not depend on this assumption.
B: This assumption is critical to the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
C: The argument is focused on industrialized nations and does not address nations that are primarily agricultural.
D: While this assumption is not necessarily incorrect, it is not critical to the argument.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The city of Gastner built a new highway linking several suburbs to downtown Gastner.
  After the new highway opened, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased.
  
A: This option suggests that people who work in the downtown area of Gastner usually commute from one of the city's suburbs. However, it does not explain why the average commute time has increased after the new highway was built. Therefore, it is not the best answer.
B: This option suggests that the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from the largest suburbs. It can be argued that after the new highway opened, people who live in the smaller suburbs started to use the new highway to commute to downtown Gastner, which increased the traffic and caused the increase in the average commute time. Therefore, it is a possible answer.
C: This option tells us that several suburban roads were upgraded with new stoplights shortly after the new highway was opened. However, this does not explain why the average commute time has increased after the new highway was built. Therefore, it is not the best answer.
D: This option tells us that road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner while the new highway was being built. However, it does not explain why the average commute time has increased after the new highway was built. Therefore, it is not the best answer.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The city of Gastner built a new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area.
  The average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
A: If most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs, and the new highway only links several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area, it is likely that only a portion of the commuters benefited from the new highway. Thus, the increased average commute time may be due to the fact that the remaining commuters, who did not benefit from the new highway, are now sharing the same roads with those who did benefit from the new highway.
B: If the location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs, it is likely that the new highway attracted many commuters from those suburbs. Thus, the increased average commute time may be due to the fact that the new highway attracted more commuters to the downtown area, putting more pressure on the existing roads leading to the downtown area.
C: If several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights, it is likely that the flow of traffic on these roads was slowed down, which may have contributed to the increased average commute time.
D: If road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner at the same time the new highway was being built, it is likely that these road repairs caused delays and traffic congestion, which may have contributed to the increased average commute time.
E: If traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened, it is likely that the new highway did not relieve enough traffic congestion to make up for the increased number of commuters. Thus, the increased average commute time may be due to the fact that the new highway was not effective in relieving traffic congestion.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument is concerned with the justification for imposing a penalty for pollution. It suggests that the evidence is not strong enough to identify the polluter, and that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe. 

A: This principle supports the argument's reasoning, which suggests that the severity of the penalty requires a higher level of certainty about the polluter's identity before imposing it.
B: This principle is not relevant to the argument, which is not concerned with the appropriate level of penalties for crimes in general.
C: This principle is not relevant to the argument, which is not concerned with the proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused.
D: This principle is not relevant to the argument, which is not concerned with the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility.
E: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning, which suggests that the severity of the penalty may be too great if there is insufficient evidence to identify the polluter.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that the penalty for the type of pollution is severe and that, without stronger evidence, it is not appropriate to impose it on the local auto repair shop. 
A: This principle expresses the idea that the more severe the penalty, the greater the level of certainty required to impose it. This aligns with the argument's reasoning.
B: This principle is not directly related to the argument's reasoning.
C: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction, which is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning.
D: This principle is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
E: This principle expresses a similar idea to choice A, but in a more extreme way.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for a particular instance of pollution in a river and the justification for imposing a severe penalty on the perpetrator.
  
A: This principle is exactly the logic used in the argument: the penalty is too severe to impose unless one is certain of the identity of the polluter.
B: This principle is not relevant to the argument.
C: This principle is about the proportionality of the severity of the penalty to the harm caused by the offense, which is not directly relevant to the argument.
D: This principle is not relevant to the argument.
E: This principle is similar to the logic used in the argument but is not the most helpful in justifying the reasoning.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument discusses the severity of the penalty for pollution and the need for stronger evidence to justify imposing the penalty.
  A: This principle directly supports the reasoning in the argument; it states that a severe penalty requires a higher degree of certainty of guilt before it can be imposed.
  B: This principle discusses the appropriate level of penalties, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  C: This principle discusses the proportionality of penalties to the harm caused, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  D: This principle discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  E: This principle is similar to choice A, but it is more specific and states that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it prevents punishment in cases where guilt can be sufficiently established.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe, and that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
  A: This principle supports the argument's reasoning that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is needed before imposing a severe penalty.
  B: This principle is not directly related to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty and the need for stronger evidence or admission of responsibility.
  C: This principle is not directly related to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty and the need for stronger evidence or admission of responsibility.
  D: This principle is not directly related to the argument's reasoning about the severity of the penalty and the need for stronger evidence or admission of responsibility.
  E: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning that the penalty should not be so severe that one can never be certain enough of guilt to justify punishment.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument is about the justification for imposing a penalty for pollution, which cannot be done unless stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is obtained. The reason for this is that the penalty is severe and the identity of the polluter is not sufficiently certain. 
A: This principle supports the argument's reasoning by stating that the severity of the penalty requires more certainty of guilt.
B: This principle discusses the appropriate level of severity for penalties, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
C: This principle addresses the proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
D: This principle discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility when the penalty is severe, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
E: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning by stating that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for the offense. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument is discussing the severity of the penalty for pollution, and how that severity affects the level of certainty required to impose that penalty. Choice A directly addresses this issue by stating that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty. This principle would help to justify the reasoning in the argument by supporting the claim that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed before imposing the penalty for pollution. Choices B, C, D, and E are not directly relevant to the issue of the severity of the penalty for pollution and do not address the reasoning in the argument.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument talks about being "sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty." 
  A: This principle states that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party. This is similar to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This principle talks about the appropriate severity of penalties, but it does not address the argument's main point about needing stronger evidence to justify imposing a penalty.
  C: This principle states that the severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction, but it does not address the argument's main point about needing stronger evidence to justify imposing a penalty.
  D: This principle talks about the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense, but it does not address the argument's main point about needing stronger evidence to justify imposing a penalty.
  E: This principle is very similar to the argument's reasoning, stating that the severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument suggests that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence is required to justify imposing the penalty.
A: This principle states that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party. This principle supports the reasoning in the argument that stronger evidence is required to justify imposing the penalty.
B: This principle discusses the appropriate level of penalties for crimes, but it is not directly relevant to the reasoning in the argument.
C: This principle is relevant to determining the severity of the penalty but does not address the issue of certainty of guilt required to impose the penalty.
D: This principle suggests that severe penalties may discourage someone from admitting responsibility. However, the argument is not discussing the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility.
E: This principle is very similar to choice A and supports the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  
A: This principle supports the reasoning in the argument that the severity of the penalty requires a higher standard of proof before punishment can be imposed.
B: This principle is not relevant to the argument that the severity of the penalty requires stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility before punishment can be imposed.
C: This principle is not relevant to the argument that the severity of the penalty requires stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility before punishment can be imposed.
D: This principle is not relevant to the argument that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is required before punishment can be imposed.
E: This principle most directly supports the reasoning in the argument that the severity of the penalty must be weighed against the certainty of guilt before punishment can be imposed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.

Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by which a group of people is to live.
- This transmission is accomplished by embodying values in heroic figures that are presented as role models.
- The imitation of these role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live. This transmission is accomplished by embodying those values in heroic figures, who are presented as role models.

A: This choice is partially correct. The professor did not mention poetry in general, but rather epic poetry. Also, the professor did not say that the most important function of epic poetry is to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it. Rather, the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values through the embodiment of heroic figures, who serve as role models. 
B: This choice is correct. The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by embodying those values in heroic figures, who are presented as role models. 
C: This choice is partially correct but is too strong. The professor did not say that values are rarely or never set forth explicitly in poetry in general, but rather in epic poetry. Also, the professor did not say that values are never set forth explicitly, only that their transmission is not accomplished by explicit discussion of those values. 
D: This choice is correct. The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by embodying those values in heroic figures, who serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported average savings of $250 a year as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. It argues that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
A: This choice raises a concern about the possibility that some policyholders saved little or no money when they switched to Popelka. However, it does not directly criticize the argument in the advertisement.
B: This choice raises a concern about the possibility that new policyholders pay less for their auto insurance than long-term policyholders. However, it does not directly criticize the argument in the advertisement.
C: This choice criticizes the argument by suggesting that another insurance company could offer even greater savings than Popelka. This presents an alternative possibility that discredits the argument.
D: This choice raises a concern about the possibility that some policyholders may have overestimated their savings. However, it does not directly criticize the argument in the advertisement.
E: This choice presents the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

  Group A was better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than Group B.
  Fourteen lapses occurred in Group B but only one lapse occurred in Group A.
  
A: This option is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it indicates that there were the same number of people in each group, which reduces the possibility of biased results due to group size.
B: This option is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it indicates that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which reduces the possibility of biased results due to different researchers.
C: This option is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it indicates that among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old, which reduces the possibility of biased results due to age differences.
D: This option is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it indicates that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which reduces the possibility of biased results due to unequal access to phones.
E: This option is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it indicates that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which reduces the possibility of biased results due to unequal time to prepare.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The study involved two groups of people, Group A composed of persons aged 65-75, and Group B composed of college students. 
  The study required each member of both groups to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time, and the time of each call was recorded electronically. 
  Group A had only one lapse while Group B had fourteen lapses, indicating that Group A was better at remembering to make the call at the specified time. 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  
  A: This statement is helpful in establishing that the two groups were equivalent in size, which is important in making a valid comparison between their performance in the study. Therefore, this statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion and is not the least helpful.
  B: This statement indicates that the same group of researchers answered calls for both groups, which helps ensure that there was no difference in the way the calls were handled that could have affected the outcome of the study. Therefore, this statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion and is not the least helpful.
  C: This statement is not particularly relevant to the conclusion and does not provide any information that would support or contradict it. However, it is not actively harmful to the conclusion and is not the least helpful.
  D: This statement is also helpful in establishing that both groups had the same resources available to them, which is important in making a valid comparison between their performance in the study. Therefore, this statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion and is not the least helpful.
  E: This statement is also helpful in establishing that both groups had the same amount of time to prepare for the task, which is important in making a valid comparison between their performance in the study. Therefore, this statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion and is not the least helpful.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the results of a study comparing the performance of two groups, one composed of people aged 65-75 (Group A) and another composed of college students (Group B). Group A performed better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than Group B did.
  
  A: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. If the number of people in each group was different, it would be difficult to compare the results and draw a valid conclusion.
  
  B: This statement is also helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. If different researchers had answered the calls made by the two groups, there could have been differences in how the calls were answered that could have affected the results.
  
  C: This statement is not relevant to the conclusion. The age of the college students is not mentioned as a factor that could affect their memory of making a telephone call at a specified time.
  
  D: This statement is also helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. If one group had restricted access to telephones, it could have affected their ability to make the required calls at a specified time.
  
  E: This statement is also helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. If one group received their instructions much earlier than the other group, it could have affected their ability to remember to make the required calls at a specified time.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The study shows that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) was better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B (composed of college students). 
  A: This choice is helpful in establishing that the two groups were of the same size, but it does not affect the conclusion that Group A was better at remembering to make a telephone call than Group B.
  B: This choice is helpful because it establishes that the researchers were the same for both groups, which eliminates a possible source of bias.
  C: This choice is helpful because it eliminates the possibility that the college students over forty years old could have skewed the results in any way.
  D: This choice is helpful because it ensures that both groups had equal access to the means required to make the telephone calls.
  E: This choice is helpful because it establishes that the instructions given to the two groups were approximately the same, which eliminates a possible source of bias. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared the ability of Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students) to make a telephone call at a specified time.
  Group A proved better at remembering to make a call at a specified time than did Group B.
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The question asks for the answer that is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn.
  
A: This answer choice is not relevant to the conclusion of the study.
B: This answer choice is important to the conclusion of the study because it helps to ensure that the same standards were used for both groups.
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the conclusion of the study.
D: This answer choice is important to the conclusion of the study because it helps to ensure that the same resources were available to both groups.
E: This answer choice is important to the conclusion of the study because it helps to ensure that the two groups were given the same instructions. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) was better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than Group B (composed of college students). There was one lapse in Group A and fourteen in Group B.
  A: This fact alone does not seem to be helpful or unhelpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. 
  B: This fact does not seem to be helpful or unhelpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
  C: This fact may suggest that the college students in Group B were younger and hence less experienced in handling responsibilities such as making calls on time. However, this fact does not contradict the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  D: This fact does not seem to be helpful or unhelpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
  E: This fact does not seem to be helpful or unhelpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.

Topic: Law
Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
Question: The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: widespread cynicism is beneficial to the wellbeing of society
  B: cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the am01mt of information one has about them
  C: the work of contemporary journalists reflects a cynicism that is not really genuine
  D: any accurate description of human bebavior portrays it as selfish
  E: cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society

  D: This is a possibility that the argument overlooks, and it weakens the argument. 
  E: This statement is already accounted for in the resident's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The resident's argument is that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity because 30 percent of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument.
  B: Inadequate site drainage is mentioned in the argument as a problem that threatens the integrity of some of the town's houses, so this possibility is not overlooked.
  C: The argument does not compare the ease of fixing inadequate site drainage and structural defects, so this possibility is not overlooked.
  D: This possibility is relevant to the argument, but it would weaken the resident's argument rather than be an oversight.
  E: This possibility is not overlooked in the argument, as the argument does not exclude the possibility that some houses have both inadequate site drainage and structural defects.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The resident's argument states that 30% of the houses in their town have inadequate site drainage, 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe, and at least 60% have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is already included in the given premises, so it is not what the argument overlooks.
  C: The ease of fixing structural defects versus inadequate site drainage is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This is a possibility that the resident's argument overlooks, as it is possible that the remaining 40% of houses have no problems.
  E: This statement is already included in the given premises, so it is not what the argument overlooks.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The resident's argument concludes that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some problem that threatens their integrity based on two pieces of data: 30% of houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  
A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument, so this is not the correct answer.
B: This statement is true, but it does not impact the reasoning in the resident's argument.
C: This statement is also true, but it does not impact the reasoning in the resident's argument.
D: This is a possible alternative explanation to the conclusion in the resident's argument, so this is a tempting answer choice. However, the argument does not overlook this possibility, as it is one of the premises in the argument.
E: This is also a possible alternative explanation to the conclusion in the resident's argument, but it is not overlooked by the argument either.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The resident's argument assumes that the two problems (inadequate site drainage and structural defects) are mutually exclusive, which may not be the case.
  A: The size of the town is irrelevant to the reasoning in the argument.
  B: This statement supports the reasoning in the resident's argument.
  C: The ease of fixing the problems is irrelevant to the reasoning in the argument.
  D: This statement contradicts the resident's argument. If many houses in the town have neither of the problems, then it is possible that less than 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  E: This statement suggests that some houses could have both problems, which means that the percentage of houses with problems could be lower than 60 percent.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The study found that the rarest species of trees tend to survive longer in tropical forests compared to the most common species, regardless of the identity of the species.
  
A. This statement provides a possible explanation for why the most common species of trees thrive in a forest, but does not explain why the rarest species tend to survive longer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that in tropical forests, trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species. 
Choices:
  A: This statement provides an explanation for why the most common species thrives, but not for why the rarest species survives longer.
  B: This statement suggests that older trees may be less successful at reproducing, but it does not explain why the rarest species survives longer.
  C: This statement provides additional information about the study, but it does not help explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  D: This statement provides a possible explanation for why the survival of trees of the rarer species is beneficial, but it does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  E: This statement provides the best explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer. If trees of the common species have more competition for resources, then they may be less likely to survive and reproduce than trees of the rarest species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that the rarest species of trees tend to survive longer than the most common species in a particular forest. 
  A, C, and D do not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer. 
  B is unlikely to explain the pattern observed in the study, as the study found that the rarest species tends to survive longer regardless of which species is the most common.
  E is likely to explain the pattern observed in the study, as it suggests that the trees of the rare species have less competition for resources than the trees of the more common species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The study found that the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, but trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.

A: This statement provides a reason why the most common species thrives in the forest, but it does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
B: This statement provides information about the reproductive behavior of older trees, but it does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
C: This statement highlights a limitation of the study design but does not provide an explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
D: This statement explains the ecological importance of the survival of trees of the rarer species, but it does not explain why those trees tend to survive longer.
E: This statement provides a plausible explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The study found that the rarest species of trees tend to survive longer in tropical forests.
  A: This statement is about the most common species of trees thriving in the forest, not about the rarest species surviving longer.
  B: This statement is about older trees reproducing less, not about rarest species surviving longer.
  C: This statement talks about the methodology of the study, but it does not help explain why the rarest species of trees tend to survive longer.
  D: This statement talks about the impact of the survival of the trees of the rarer species, but it does not help explain why they tend to survive longer.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about when we can or cannot praise or blame a person for an action.
  The argument rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew more about the events leading up to an action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Choice A: This statement is related to praise or blame, but it does not support the conclusion of the argument.
Choice B: This statement supports the argument's conclusion that the amount of information that others possess does not determine whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible.
Choice C: This statement is restating the conclusion of the argument and not enabling the argument's conclusion to be properly drawn.
Choice D: This statement suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. This supports the conclusion of the argument.
Choice E: This statement is not related to the argument's conclusion that we can still praise or blame a person even if we know a lot about the events leading up to an action.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The ethicist also rejects Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about the events leading up to any action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  A: This answer choice is not directly related to the conclusion of the argument.
  B: This answer choice supports the conclusion of the argument, which is that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: This answer choice restates the premise of the argument, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  D: This answer choice presents an idea related to the argument, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  E: This answer choice is opposite to what the ethicist is arguing. The ethicist claims that we must know a lot about the events leading up to an action in order to praise or blame someone for it; this answer choice claims that we only consider an action freely performed if we don't know much about the events leading up to it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The ethicist argues that we are only justified in praising or blaming a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew more about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.

Action: Answer(B) 

Explanation: 
The conclusion of the argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim. The argument is that we are only justified in praising or blaming a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led up to that action. Assumption B supports this argument by stating that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This assumption supports the idea that we need to know a lot about the events leading up to an action to determine whether a person is responsible for that action, and therefore, supports the conclusion that we must reject Tolstoy's claim.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the conditions under which we are justified in praising or blaming a person for an action. 
  The argument rejects Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events leading to an action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Choice analysis:
  A: This is a claim about people's responsibility for actions, but it does not enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
  B: This choice states that the responsibility a person bears for an act is not determined by how much people know about that act. This is consistent with the argument's rejection of Tolstoy's claim and enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  C: This choice simply restates the premise of the argument and does not enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
  D: This choice is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion.
  E: This choice is the opposite of what the argument suggests. The argument states that knowing more about the events leading to an action does not make us cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument is about when it is justified to praise or blame someone for an action, rejecting Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events leading up to an action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed.
A: This statement contradicts the argument in the passage, since the ethicist argues that we are sometimes justified to blame or praise someone for an action, even if it was caused by conditions beyond their control.
B: This statement supports the argument in the passage, since the ethicist argues that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not determined by how much information others possess about that action.
C: This statement restates the argument in the passage, rather than enabling the conclusion to be drawn.
D: This statement provides an alternative explanation for why we might be inclined to praise or blame someone for an action, but it does not enable the conclusion to be drawn.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument in the passage, since it only talks about how much we know about the events leading up to an action, rather than when it is justified to praise or blame someone for that action.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. 
A: This statement is not related to the conclusion of the argument.
B: This statement supports the conclusion of the argument that the responsibility for an action is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
C: This statement is a repetition of the premise of the argument and does not help in the conclusion of the argument.
D: This statement is not related to the conclusion of the argument.
E: This statement is the opposite of the conclusion of the argument. The argument states that only when we know a lot about the events leading to an action can we praise or blame a person for that action. Therefore, if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we cannot regard that action as freely performed.

Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that a study showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland. The argument goes on to say that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.

A: This choice does not seem relevant to the argument.
B: This choice does not seem relevant to the argument.
C: This choice does not seem relevant to the argument.
D: The argument seems to confuse the effect of a phenomenon (i.e., alleviating the symptoms of insomnia) with its cause (i.e., the pineal gland producing less melatonin as it ages).
E: This choice is possible, as the argument does not provide information on the representativeness of the study's sample.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")

The pharmacist's argument is flawed because it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause. The argument assumes that the cause of insomnia in people aged 65-81 is the decrease in melatonin produced by the pineal gland. However, the study only shows that melatonin can alleviate the symptoms of insomnia, not that the decrease in melatonin is the cause of the insomnia. Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause. None of the other answer choices accurately describe the flaw in the argument.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that a large study showed that most of the symptoms of insomnia are alleviated by melatonin, and that the claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of biased individuals.
  C: The argument does not use two different meanings for the same term.
  D: This is the correct answer since the argument confuses the effect of a phenomenon (i.e. alleviating symptoms of insomnia) with its cause (i.e. the pineal gland producing less melatonin as it ages).
  E: The argument does not provide information that the sample used is unrepresentative.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist's argument is based on a study that showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia's symptoms, and that the hormone is produced by the pineal gland. 
  A: The argument does not infer from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased.
  C: The argument does not depend on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
  D: The argument confuses the effect of a phenomenon with its cause by assuming that the reason for the alleviation of insomnia symptoms is that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages, whereas the study does not provide evidence for this claim.
  E: The argument does not rely on a sample that is unrepresentative.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument is discussing the effectiveness of melatonin in alleviating insomnia's symptoms in individuals aged 65-81.
  The argument concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  The argument does not provide any evidence or support for the conclusion.
  A: This choice is not applicable to the argument.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased.
  C: This choice is not applicable to the argument.
  D: The argument is confusing an effect of melatonin with its cause. The argument assumes that the effectiveness of melatonin is due to the fact that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages, but it does not provide any evidence or support for this assumption.
  E: The argument does not provide any information about the representativeness of the sample used in the study.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that most of the symptoms of insomnia are alleviated by ingesting melatonin, which is produced by the pineal gland. 
  It further claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  A: This choice talks about inferring intention, which is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This choice talks about bias, which is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This choice talks about different meanings for the same term, which is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This choice talks about confusing effect with cause, which is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This choice talks about an unrepresentative sample, which is relevant to the argument since the argument is based on a large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia, and it is not clear if this sample is representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist argues that a study showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland and plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock.
  The pharmacist assumes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  
A: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: The pharmacist does not rely on the opinions of biased individuals.
C: The argument does not use two different meanings for the same term to draw a conclusion.
D: This is the correct answer. The pharmacist confuses the effect of melatonin supplements with the cause of insomnia.
E: There is no information to suggest that the sample used in the study is unrepresentative.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the effectiveness of melatonin in treating insomnia.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of biased individuals.
  C: The argument does not use two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
  D: This choice is the best answer. The argument confuses the effect of melatonin on alleviating insomnia with the cause of insomnia.
  E: The argument doesn't provide enough information about the representativeness of the sample used in the study.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist argues that a study shows that ingesting melatonin can alleviate insomnia's symptoms in people aged 65-81.
  The pharmacist claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct.
  The recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are not mentioned in the passage, but they are likely to be that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.

Analysis:
  The pharmacist's argument seems to be that because a study shows melatonin can alleviate insomnia's symptoms in people aged 65-81, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct. This argument is flawed because the study does not necessarily prove that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.

Action: Answer("D")

  The pharmacist concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
  
A: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the pharmacist. 
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the pharmacist.
C: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the pharmacist.
D: This choice is the best answer because the argument made by the pharmacist confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause. The fact that melatonin alleviates insomnia's symptoms does not necessarily mean that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages. It could be that aging affects the body's ability to use melatonin, which is a different phenomenon. 
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the pharmacist.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the results of an experiment with 50 patients with chronic back pain, where small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
A: This statement suggests that the patients' beliefs could have influenced their perception of pain relief, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument.
B: This statement presents an alternative method of pain relief, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnets.
C: This statement suggests a limitation to the study's findings, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument.
D: This statement suggests potential bias in the study's design, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument.
E: This statement suggests that the variation in the specific causes of chronic back pain could have influenced the study's results, which directly counters the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the results of the experiment conducted with 50 patients with chronic back pain. 
  A: This choice suggests that the improvement in pain reported by the first group may have been caused by the patients' expectations or beliefs about the treatment, rather than the magnetic fields themselves. However, this does not necessarily disprove the physician's argument.
  B: This choice presents an alternative treatment option but does not necessarily disprove the physician's argument.
  C: This choice suggests that the results of the experiment may not be generalizable to other areas of the body, but it does not necessarily disprove the physician's argument.
  D: This choice suggests that there may have been bias among the scientists involved in the experiment, but it does not necessarily disprove the physician's argument.
  E: This choice suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain may have affected the results of the experiment, and thus, it provides the strongest counter to the physician's argument. If the variation in causes is too large, it may not be possible to make a conclusion about the effectiveness of magnetic fields on back pain. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that small magnets applied to the backs of patients with chronic back pain are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  A: This choice suggests that the reported reduction in pain could have been due to the patients' beliefs about the treatment, rather than the actual magnetic fields themselves. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnets.
  B: This choice presents an alternative treatment for chronic back pain, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnets.
  C: This choice suggests that the experiment may not have been conclusive, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnets.
  D: This choice suggests that there may have been bias in the design of the experiment, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnets.
  E: This choice suggests that the patients in the experiment may have had different causes of their back pain, which could have affected the results. This directly counters the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment where small magnets were applied to the backs of one group of 50 patients with chronic back pain, and the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, but very few in the second group.
  A: This choice presents an alternative explanation for the reduction in pain in the first group of patients.
  B: This choice presents an alternative treatment for back pain, but it does not provide evidence against magnetic fields as a treatment.
  C: This choice presents a limitation in the generalization of the results of the experiment, but it does not provide evidence against magnetic fields as a treatment.
  D: This choice presents a potential bias in the experiment, but it does not provide evidence against magnetic fields as a treatment.
  E: This choice undermines the internal validity of the experiment because the specific causes of the chronic back pain were not controlled for, which could confound the results.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that applying small magnets to the backs of patients with chronic back pain reduces pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the apparent improvement in pain might be due to a placebo effect rather than to the magnetic fields.
  B: This statement is an opinion and does not provide evidence against the physician's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that the results of the experiment might not be generalizable to other areas of pain relief, but it does not contradict the physician's argument.
  D: This statement does not provide evidence against the physician's argument.
  E: This statement suggests that the variation in the causes of the chronic back pain might have influenced the results of the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the group that received magnets reported a significant reduction in pain, whereas very few in the group that received no treatment reported such a reduction.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the patients' condition may be due to the placebo effect rather than the magnetic fields.
  B: This statement presents an alternative treatment option for chronic back pain, but it does not constitute a counter to the physician's argument that magnetic fields are effective.
  C: This statement suggests that the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing pain has not been proven in other areas of the body. However, it does not constitute a counter to the physician's argument that magnetic fields are effective for the back pain.
  D: This statement suggests that the scientists who designed the experiment had a bias in favor of magnetic fields. However, it does not constitute a counter to the physician's argument that magnetic fields are effective for the back pain.
  E: This statement suggests that there may be a variety of causes for chronic back pain, which may affect the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement does not directly relate to the effectiveness of magnetic fields on reducing back pain.
  B: This statement is an opinion and does not directly relate to the effectiveness of magnetic fields on reducing back pain.
  C: This statement suggests that there is no evidence that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back, but it does not directly relate to the effectiveness of magnetic fields on reducing back pain.
  D: This statement suggests that the scientists who helped design the experiment were biased towards magnetic fields relieving back pain, but it does not directly relate to the effectiveness of magnetic fields on reducing back pain.
  E: This statement suggests that the wide variation in specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could have influenced the results, which weakens the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The physician conducted an experiment on 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  One group received small magnets applied to their backs; the other group received no treatment.
  Most of the patients in the magnet group, but very few in the non-treatment group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  The physician concludes that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  
A: This information suggests that the patients in the magnet group may have experienced the placebo effect, which could account for their reported reduction in pain. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain.
B: This statement is an opinion and does not provide evidence that counters the physician's argument.
C: This statement is specific to the experiment conducted by the physician and does not provide evidence that counters the physician's argument.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
E: This statement suggests that there may have been variation in the causes of the chronic back pain experienced by the patients in the experiment, which could affect the results of the experiment and the physician's conclusion.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain, as most patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the condition of the first group of patients may have been due to a placebo effect, i.e., the patients may have felt better simply because they believed they were receiving a treatment, rather than because the magnets themselves had any therapeutic effect.
  B: This statement is an opinion and does not constitute a logical counter-argument to the physician's argument based on the experiment.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it does not contradict the physician's claim that the experiment showed that magnetic fields are effective at reducing back pain.
  D: This statement does not contradict the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing back pain.
  E: This statement suggests that the improvement in the condition of the first group of patients may have been due to factors other than the magnets themselves, such as differences in the underlying causes of their pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain using an experiment where 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. 
A: This choice suggests that the patients in the first group's improvement could be due to the placebo effect and not the magnets. However, it does not directly counter the argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
B: This choice is irrelevant to the argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
C: This choice suggests that the physician's conclusion may not be generalizable to other areas of pain. However, it does not directly counter the argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
D: This choice suggests that the experiment may have been biased. However, it does not directly counter the argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
E: This choice suggests that the patients in the experiment had different causes of back pain.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The new program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
- In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.

Reasoning:
- The program used paycheck counts to estimate employment.
- Some employees receive multiple paychecks per pay period.
- The total number of paychecks may have increased although there was no actual growth in employment.

Action: Answer("D")  
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and uses that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.

Analysis:
  The new computer program simply tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and uses that figure as its estimate of employment. In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the total number of paychecks issued in the first quarter for which the new program was used would have been higher than the actual number of employees in X.

Action: Answer("D") 
The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
- The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in Country X and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
- The government reported that there was a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
- Some employers in Country X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses and commissions.
- We do not know the actual number of people employed in Country X.

Analysis:
- The new program tallied the number of paychecks, not the number of people employed. Therefore, if some employees received separate paychecks for different types of pay, the program may have counted them as more than one employee.
- The government's report that there was a large increase in the number of people employed may be inaccurate if the program counted some employees more than once.

Action: Answer("D")  
The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The new computer program counts the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in Country X and uses that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.

Reasoning:
  If some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses and commissions, then the total number of paychecks issued in the first quarter would overestimate the number of people employed in X. Therefore, the government's estimate of employment growth in the first quarter may be inaccurate.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program in 1988 to determine the number of people employed in the country. 
  The new program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. 
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
A: The information in the passage does not support this conclusion.
B: The information in the passage does not support this conclusion.
C: The information in the passage does not provide any information about the government's reports on employment figures prior to the use of the new program.
D: The fact that some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions suggests that the number of paychecks issued by employers would be greater than the number of employees actually employed, which could lead to an overestimation of the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
E: The information in the passage does not support this conclusion.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
  A: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
  B: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
  C: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
  D: Since some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions, the number of paychecks would be more than the actual number of employees. Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks issued by employers in Country X to estimate employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses and commissions.
  There was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  
Analysis: 
  The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers. Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the number of paychecks issued for that period would have been more than the actual number of people employed. It means the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X. In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  A: There is no information to support this answer choice.
  B: The fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period does not necessarily mean that the people who designed the new program were unaware of this fact.
  C: There is no information to support or refute this answer choice.
  D: The government's new program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, which means that the program would have counted multiple paychecks per employee if they were issued. Therefore, it is likely that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: There is no information to support or refute this answer choice.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program in Country X tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The fact that some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions creates the possibility that the new program may have counted these as separate employees, leading to an overestimation of the number of people employed. Therefore, one can conclude that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and uses that figure as its estimate of employment.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The new computer program counts the number of paychecks, not the number of employees. Therefore, if one employee receives multiple paychecks, he or she will be counted as multiple employees. Thus, the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed is likely to be inflated.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument mentions that Wilson Appliance's product made up 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers five years ago, but currently it only makes up 25 percent of such sales. 
  It also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. 
  The conclusion is that Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: This is the correct answer. The argument assumes that the decline in sales of the Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is due to a decline in the market share, and that the total sales of hair dryers have not changed over the last 5 years. However, this may not be true, and the total sales of hair dryers may have increased or decreased during this time, which would affect the company's net income.
  B: The argument mentions that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, so this choice is not correct.
  C: The argument is focused on the sales figures of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer, so this choice is not correct.
  D: The argument does not mention anything about the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer, so this choice is not correct.
  E: The argument does not provide any evidence about whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of its least profitable products, so this choice is not correct.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide 5 years ago, but currently, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. The average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: This choice correctly identifies that the argument confuses a decline in market share with a decline in total sales. However, this does not necessarily mean that the argument is flawed. 
B: This choice discusses information that is not relevant to the argument. 
C: This choice discusses information that is not relevant to the argument. 
D: This choice presents an alternative explanation for the decline in Wilson Appliance's net income, which may weaken the argument. 
E: This choice introduces new information that is not relevant to the argument. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales currently, and it was 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago. 
  The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The conclusion is that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: This is a possible flaw. The decline in market share does not necessarily imply a decline in total sales. It is possible that the total sales of hair dryers increased over the last five years, and Wilson Appliance's sales simply decreased while others increased. 
B: This is not a flaw relevant to the argument. The argument assumes that the net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
C: This is not a flaw relevant to the argument. The argument only discusses the sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers.
D: This is a possible flaw. The argument assumes that the retail price of the hair dryer has remained constant over the last 5 years. If the retail price of the hair dryer increased, then the net income from sales of the product would not necessarily be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
E: This is not a flaw relevant to the argument. The argument does not discuss other products of Wilson Appliance. 

Action: Answer("A")

  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It mentions that the hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago and it accounts for only 25% of such sales currently.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. The argument is focused on Wilson Appliance's hair dryer only and its net income from sales of the product.
C: The argument does not discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers. It is only concerned with the hair dryer produced by the company.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years. If the price has increased, then the net income from sales of the product may not necessarily be half of what it was 5 years ago.
E: The argument does not provide any information about whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers five years ago and currently it accounts for only 25% of such sales.

A: The argument doesn't mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. 
B: The argument provides specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for Wilson Appliance, stating that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
C: The argument doesn't need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers since the conclusion is only about the company's net income from sales of its hair dryers.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which could potentially impact the company's net income.
E: The argument doesn't provide any information about whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer product accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide 5 years ago, but now it accounts for only 25% of such sales. 
  It also states that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago because of the decline in market share, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product, but it is based on the assumption that a decline in market share necessarily means a decline in net income.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them, it is focusing on Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer product.
C: The argument only discusses Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer product and does not need to discuss sales figures for the company's other products.
D: The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, but it overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which would affect net income.
E: The argument does not provide any information about whether the hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products, but it assumes that the decline in market share is the cause of the decline in net income.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has decreased from 50% to 25% and that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: This is correct because the argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the last 5 years, which may not be the case. If the total sales of hair dryers have decreased, then the decrease in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may not necessarily result in a decline in the company's net income from sales of the product.
B: This is incorrect because the argument provides information about the net income per hair dryer sold and concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
C: This is incorrect because the argument focuses specifically on Wilson Appliance's hair dryer and does not discuss sales figures for the company's other products.
D: This is incorrect because the argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. If the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer had increased over the past 5 years, then the company's net income from sales of the product may not have decreased as much as the argument suggests.
E: This is incorrect because the argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. If Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products, then the company may have been losing money on the product even when it accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide 5 years ago and now it accounts for 25% of such sales. The average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product because it specifically mentions that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them, because it assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
C: The argument does not fail to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers because the argument only focuses on the hair dryer product.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which could have resulted in maintaining the net income from sales of the product.
E: The argument does not provide any information about the profitability of Wilson Appliance's other products, so it is not relevant to the conclusion of the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% over the last 5 years, and that the average net income per hair dryer sold has remained the same.
  The conclusion is that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: This is true. The argument assumes that the decline in market share is the same as the decline in total sales, which may not be true. The argument does not provide any information on the total sales of hair dryers in the market.
B: This is not relevant to the argument. The argument is concerned with the net income generated by Wilson's hair dryer sales, not the profits generated by other companies that produce hair dryers.
C: This is not relevant to the argument. The argument is concerned with the net income generated by Wilson's hair dryer sales, not the sales figures of its other products.
D: This is a possible alternative explanation for the decline in net income, and the argument does not address this possibility. However, the argument does not overlook it, and the conclusion may still be valid if this alternative explanation is not true.
E: This is not relevant to the argument. The argument assumes that the hair dryer is a profitable product for Wilson Appliance, and the conclusion is that the net income from sales of the product has declined by half.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales declined from 50% to 25% over the past 5 years.
  The argument also states that the average net income per hair dryer sold has been constant during this period.
  The argument concludes that Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of hair dryers must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: The argument does not make this mistake. It clearly states that the percentage of sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers declined, not the total sales of the product.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about profits generated by hair dryers produced by other companies. The conclusion is specifically about Wilson Appliance's hair dryers.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for other products produced by Wilson Appliance. The conclusion is specifically about sales of hair dryers produced by the company.
D: The argument overlooks this possibility, but it does not necessarily invalidate the conclusion. The argument assumes that the net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the past 5 years, so an increase in the retail price would not affect the conclusion that net income has declined.
E: The argument does not state that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. It assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has remained constant over the past 5 years.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Critic: The recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what is of most interest about him. It is by an expert on the history of Elizabethan England, and so does a good job of showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time. But it does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
Question: The conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: There is no way to know what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
  B: The life of the average man in Elizabethan England is uninteresting.
  C: Shakespeare was very different from the other men of his time.
  D: A biography should always focus on what makes its subject distinctive.
  E: What is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the iguana species on the islands in question must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia.
A: This information does not affect the argument and may be true even if the argument is true.
B: If the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, it would suggest that the iguana species on the islands did not come from the Americas, which weakens the argument.
C: The fact that documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon does not necessarily weaken the argument, since uncommon cases still occur.
D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, it would suggest that the iguana species on the islands did not come from the Americas, which weakens the argument.
E: This information does not affect the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands in question must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  A: This statement does not directly address the argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  B: This statement does not directly address the argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  C: This statement may be relevant to the argument since it suggests that rafting between land masses is uncommon, but it does not directly address the argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  D: This statement weakens the scientist's argument since it suggests that the iguana species may not have rafted from the Americas, but rather developed independently in Australia and then spread to the islands.
  E: This statement does not directly address the argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands near Australia came from the Americas by rafting on floating debris. The argument assumes that the species did not exist elsewhere and that there was a mechanism for rafting across the Pacific. 
A: This statement does not directly address the argument about the origin of the iguanas on the islands.
B: If the iguanas on the islands are genetically different from those found in the Americas, it could suggest that they did not come from the Americas and instead evolved separately on the islands.
C: This statement does not directly address the argument about the origin of the iguanas on the islands.
D: If fossils of related iguana species have been found in Australia, it would suggest that the iguanas on the islands could have come from Australia instead of the Americas.
E: This statement does not directly address the argument about the origin of the iguanas on the islands.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the small group of islands near Australia are closely related to the ones found in the Americas, and that they must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: Other animal species on the island not being found in the Americas is not relevant to the argument about the iguanas.
  B: If genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, it would weaken the argument that they must have rafted from the Americas.
  C: If documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon, it would strengthen the argument that the iguanas rafted from the Americas, as they may have been the only way for the iguanas to reach the islands.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia is not relevant to the argument that they must have rafted from the Americas.
  E: The fact that the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana is not relevant to the argument about the iguanas.
Action: Answer("B")

  A: This statement does not have any effect on the scientist's argument because the argument is focused solely on the iguana species, not all animal species that inhabit the islands.
  B: If the genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, it would weaken the scientist's argument because it would suggest that the iguana species on the islands did not come from the Americas.
  C: This statement does not have any effect on the scientist's argument because the argument is focused on the iguana species, not all documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses.
  D: This statement actually supports the scientist's argument because it suggests that the iguana species may have originated in Australia.
  E: This statement does not have any effect on the scientist's argument because the argument is focused solely on the iguana species, not all plant and animal species found in Australia or South America.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on a group of islands near Australia came from the Americas by rafting on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean. 
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument made by the scientist as it does not concern the iguana species in question.
  B: Genetic differences between the iguana species on the islands and those found in the Americas do not disprove the argument made by the scientist as it is possible for genetic changes to occur over time.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not disprove the argument made by the scientist as it only suggests that such cases are uncommon.
  D: The discovery of fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands in Australia does not disprove the argument made by the scientist as it is still possible for the progenitors of the island iguanas to have rafted on floating debris from the Americas.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument made by the scientist as it concerns the lineage of plant and animal species in Australia or South America, not the origin of the iguana species in question.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguanas in the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, their progenitors could not have migrated over land bridges.
  A: This statement does not address the scientist's argument regarding the iguanas' migration to the islands.
  B: If the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, this does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument that the iguanas must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  C: This statement is not sufficient to weaken the scientist's argument, as rare occurrences of iguanas rafting long distances do not rule out the possibility of the iguanas in the islands having rafted from the Americas.
  D: This statement strengthens the scientist's argument by providing evidence that iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, which is consistent with the idea that the iguanas rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  E: This statement does not address the scientist's argument regarding the iguanas' migration to the islands.
Action: Answer("D")

Knowledge:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia.
A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument about the iguana species' origins.
B: If the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, it could mean that they did not come from the Americas.
C: The scientist only needs to show that it is possible for iguanas to raft across long distances, not that it is common.
D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, it weakens the argument that the iguanas came from the Americas. 
E: This choice is irrelevant to the argument about the iguana species' origins.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands originated from the Americas and arrived on floating debris.
- A: This choice doesn't address the argument about the iguanas' origins and how they got to the islands. It's not relevant to the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The editorialist claims that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, citing studies conducted 30 years ago that showed this to be the case.
A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it does not accurately describe the editorialist's argument. The editorialist did not draw a conclusion based on a general statement inferred from a limited number of instances. Rather, the editorialist cited specific studies to support their conclusion.
B: This choice describes a possible flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate description of a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist did not fail to consider the possibility that the latest technology might allow for more air traffic without reducing safety; in fact, the editorialist specifically mentioned that council members claimed safety would not be reduced because of the latest safety technology.
C: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The fact that council members may be aware of the studies conducted 30 years ago does not necessarily mean that the editorialist's conclusion - that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety - is flawed.
D: This accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist is making a claim based on the absence of evidence (that the latest safety technology will be enough to prevent a decrease in safety) rather than the existence of evidence (that the studies conducted 30 years ago showed a decrease in safety when air traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity).
E: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist is not discussing whether a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if there are overriding benefits of another kind; rather, the editorialist is arguing that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity would decrease safety. The council members disagree, stating that the latest safety technology would mitigate any safety risks. The editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago that show a decrease in safety at airports that exceeded their original design capacity.
A: This choice describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist draws a conclusion based on a limited number of instances and infers a general statement from them.
B: This choice suggests a possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not a flaw in the argument itself.
C: This choice suggests a possibility that the argument fails to consider. However, this does not necessarily constitute a flaw in the argument.
D: This choice describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist confuses the lack of evidence to support the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with evidence against the claim.
E: This choice suggests a possibility that the argument fails to consider, but it is not a flaw in the argument itself.

Knowledge:
  The editorialist claims that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The city council members claim that the increase would not decrease safety as they would use the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist cites numerous studies conducted 30 years ago that show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.

Analysis:
  A: The editorialist does make a general statement based on a limited number of particular instances, but this does not describe a flaw in the argument.
  B: The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the latest technology could make a difference in safety, as the city council members are claiming they will use the latest safety technology.
  C: The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: This accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist assumes that the studies from 30 years ago are still relevant today and that there is no evidence to suggest otherwise. However, it is possible that there is evidence today that suggests an airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity if they use the latest safety technology.
  E: The argument does not consider the possibility of a trade-off between safety risks and other benefits.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety. This is based on studies conducted 30 years ago that show safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.

A: This answer choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it does not accurately describe the flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist is not drawing a conclusion from a limited number of particular instances.
B: This answer choice describes a possible flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate flaw in the editorialist's argument.

A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it does not accurately describe the flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  B: This choice describes a possible counterargument to the editorialist's conclusion, but it is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  C: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  D: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist assumes that the studies conducted 30 years ago are still relevant today, but he/she does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
  E: This choice describes a possible counterargument to the editorialist's conclusion, but it is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity, even with the latest safety technology, would decrease safety. The argument is based on evidence from studies conducted 30 years ago.
  
A: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument, but it does not specifically address the argument's use of evidence from studies conducted 30 years ago.
B: This choice suggests a different argument that could be made, but it does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
C: This choice suggests that the city council members might be aware of the studies, but it does not address the argument's use of evidence from studies conducted 30 years ago.
D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument assumes that the absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity is the same as evidence against this claim.
E: This choice suggests a different argument that could be made, but it does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The editorialist claims that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety. The city council members believe that the latest safety technology would compensate for this increase in traffic.
A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but not the one identified in the context. It is talking about a different issue.
B: This choice describes a possible flaw in the city council members' argument, but not the editorialist's argument.
C: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. It is just a statement that the council members might know about the studies and still support the increase in air traffic.
D: This is the correct choice. The editorialist claims that studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology. However, this does not mean that there is evidence against the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity. It just means that there is no evidence to support this claim.
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument presented in the context.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychiatrist: Take any visceral emotion you care to consider. There are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion. So, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Anger is always expressible.
  B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: Some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express.
  D: All emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: An emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The argument presented states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, and then concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger. In order for this conclusion to logically follow, it must be assumed that anger is a visceral emotion, as stated in choice B. The other answer choices are not necessary assumptions for the conclusion to follow logically.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, and thus, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  A: This choice is too extreme. The argument only says that there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion. It does not say that anger must always be expressible.
  B: The argument states that anger is a visceral emotion, so this choice is correct.
  C: This choice contradicts the argument's claim that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion.
  D: The argument does not state that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral, so this choice is incorrect.
  E: This choice is too extreme. The argument only says that there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion. It does not say that an emotion must only be visceral if it is healthy to express.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about expressing anger and its relation to healthiness.
  The psychiatrist states that there are situations where it is healthy to express any visceral emotion, including anger.
  In logic, an assumption is a statement that is taken for granted or accepted as true without proof.
  
Analysis:
  The argument claims that there are situations where it is healthy to express any visceral emotion, including anger. It does not claim that anger is always expressible, nor that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral. The argument is also not concerned with whether some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express. The assumption that best supports the psychiatrist's conclusion is that anger is a visceral emotion.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, and therefore, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger. 
A: This statement is too extreme and all-encompassing, and hence it cannot be assumed.
B: The argument states that anger is a visceral emotion, so this statement is already assumed.
C: This statement contradicts the argument and weakens the conclusion, so it cannot be assumed.
D: This statement goes beyond the scope of the argument and cannot be assumed.
E: This statement is too extreme and all-encompassing, and hence it cannot be assumed.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express visceral emotions and concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
A: The argument does not assume that anger is always expressible.
B: This is a premise of the argument, not an assumption.
C: This statement contradicts the premise of the argument, so it cannot be assumed for the conclusion to follow logically.
D: This statement is not mentioned in the argument, so it cannot be assumed for the conclusion to follow logically.
E: This statement is not mentioned in the argument, so it cannot be assumed for the conclusion to follow logically.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that there are situations in which it is healthy to express any visceral emotion, and that therefore it is healthy to express anger in some situations. 
  A: The argument does not state that anger is always expressible.
  B: The argument states that anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: The argument does not state that some emotions are unhealthy to express.
  D: The argument does not state that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: The argument does not state that an emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The argument is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion and therefore it is always healthy to try to express one's anger.
- A: The argument does not make the claim that anger is always expressible.
- B: This is a premise of the argument, not an assumption.
- C: This information is irrelevant to the conclusion.
- D: The argument does not claim that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
- E: The argument does not assume that an emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge: 
  The psychiatrist claims that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion. 
  The psychiatrist specifically mentions anger as an example of a visceral emotion that can be expressed healthily.
  
Reasoning: 
  The argument concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger. The premise given to support this conclusion is that any visceral emotion can be healthily expressed in some situations. Therefore, if we assume that anger is a type of visceral emotion, then the conclusion logically follows. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The psychiatrist argues that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, including anger.
  A: This statement is too extreme and not necessary for the conclusion to follow logically.
  B: This statement is a premise of the argument, not an assumption.
  C: This statement contradicts the psychiatrist's argument and is not necessary for the conclusion to follow logically.
  D: This statement is not necessary for the conclusion to follow logically.
  E: This statement contradicts the psychiatrist's argument and is not necessary for the conclusion to follow logically.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, therefore there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express anger.
  A: This assumption is not necessary because the argument is not concerned with whether or not anger is always expressible.
  B: This assumption is necessary because the argument relies on anger being a visceral emotion.
  C: This assumption is not necessary because the argument is not concerned with whether or not some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express.
  D: This assumption is not necessary because the argument is not concerned with all emotions that are healthy to express.
  E: This assumption is not necessary because the argument is not concerned with whether or not an emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding specifically designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, and supports this claim with the fact that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
A: This answer is a possible criticism of the argument since it overlooks the possibility that the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes may be higher than those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes, which would make the bicycle lanes less safe. 
B: This answer provides an alternative explanation for the higher number of collisions on roads with bicycle lanes, but it does not criticize the argument directly.
C: This answer is not a direct criticism of the argument, but it questions an assumption made by the argument, which is that enhancing the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
D: This answer is not a direct criticism of the argument, but it is a mischaracterization of the argument. The argument does not claim that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
E: This answer is also a possible criticism of the argument since it suggests that the statistical evidence presented in the argument does not support the conclusion drawn by the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. 
  A: This option is relevant, but it does not criticize the argument for its vulnerability. It only offers an alternative possibility.
  B: This option is not relevant to the argument because the argument is primarily concerned with the safety of bicyclists on roads with designated bicycle lanes compared to roads without such lanes.
  C: This option is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  D: This option is not relevant to the argument because the argument is not based on the safety of some roads over others, but rather the comparison of designated bicycle lanes to roads without such lanes.
  E: This option is relevant to the argument's vulnerability because it suggests that the statistical evidence used by the argument does not necessarily support its conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available. This option does not help explain the findings of the nicotine study.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes. This option does not help explain the findings of the nicotine study.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. This option helps explain the findings of the nicotine study because it suggests that the amount of nicotine that is absorbed into the blood is not affected by the level of nicotine in the cigarette.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes. This option is irrelevant to the findings of the nicotine study.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily. This option is irrelevant to the findings of the nicotine study.
Action: Answer("C")

B: This statement might help explain why smokers of different nicotine levels of cigarettes would have the same levels of nicotine in their blood, but it is not directly related to the study's conclusion.
C: This statement provides the most plausible explanation for the finding of the nicotine study. If most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities, then it makes sense that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
D: This statement might be interesting, but it is not directly related to the study's conclusion. Tar levels in cigarettes are not necessarily related to nicotine levels in the blood.

Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute
  E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between withholding relevant information and lying by providing an example that supports this distinction. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist defends what they consider a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The journalist argues that there is a difference between lying and withholding relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information, and that the latter is not unethical since it does not actively encourage a false belief. The example of withholding relevant information in interviews is offered as a clear instance of the distinction between the two cases.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending what he/she considers a controversial distinction (withholding information vs. lying) by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The journalist argues that withholding information is not the same as lying, and that the distinction between the two is important.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist starts by acknowledging that it is unethical for journalists to lie, but then draws a distinction between lying and withholding information in interviews. The journalist argues that withholding information is not the same as lying, and therefore, it is not unethical. The journalist defends this distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it, which is when journalists withhold information in interviews to elicit new information. Therefore, the correct answer is B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply. The journalist is discussing the ethical principle that lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief, and is comparing it to the act of withholding relevant information in interviews. The journalist argues that withholding information is not the same as lying because it does not actively encourage a false belief.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding information by offering an example of a clear instance of withholding information. The journalist argues that withholding information should not be considered as unethical as lying because there is a difference between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one, and lying actively encourages a false belief. Therefore, the journalist is defending an ethical distinction by offering an example of it. Hence, the correct answer is B.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply. The journalist discusses the distinction between lying and withholding relevant information in interviews and argues that while both may involve intentional deception, lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief, which is not the case with withholding information. Therefore, the journalist is using a comparison of two cases to defend a moral principle.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist defends what they consider a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it. Specifically, the journalist is arguing that withholding information in interviews is not the same as lying because they do not actively encourage a false belief, and they support this argument by providing an example of how withholding information can elicit new information.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist defends what he considers a controversial distinction between intentionally lying and withholding relevant information by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The journalist argues that intentionally lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief, while withholding relevant information is not unethical because it only fails to prevent a false belief. Thus, the journalist is defending a controversial distinction by offering an example of it. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending what he/she considers a controversial distinction (withholding information vs. lying) by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The example is that lying actively encourages a false belief, while withholding information only fails to prevent one.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mario: I see that the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business. Evidently there's little demand for rugs in Glendale. So if you're planning to open a new business there, rugs would be one product to avoid. Renate: It's true that the store is gone, but its closing had little to do with the product it sold. All this means is that the
Question: The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: the rug store in Glendale sold rugs of inferior quality
  B: it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale
  C: it is possible to determine the market for rugs in Glendale
  D: any other stores have gone out of business in Glendale
  E: rug stores can close because of insufficient demand for rugs
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Mario suggests that the only rug store in Glendale went out of business because there is little demand for rugs in Glendale, and therefore, opening a new business that sells rugs would not be a good idea. On the other hand, Renate disagrees with Mario's suggestion and claims that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
  Mario thinks that because the only rug store in Glendale went out of business, there's little demand for rugs in Glendale. Therefore, he thinks that if someone is planning to open a new business there, rugs should be avoided.
  Renate disagrees with Mario's conclusion. She thinks that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold, and that rugs might still be a good business to open in Glendale.
  
Inference:
  Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale, given that the only rug store in Glendale went out of business. While Mario thinks that rugs should be avoided because of lack of demand, Renate thinks that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, Renate believes that rugs might still be a good business to open in Glendale. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Mario suggests that since the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business, there must be little demand for rugs in the area. Therefore, he advises not to open a business that sells rugs. Renate, however, disagrees and points out that the closing of the store had little to do with the product it sold. Thus, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Mario indicates that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale, and suggests avoiding selling rugs. Renate, on the other hand, argues that the rug store closing had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, there seems to be a disagreement between Mario and Renate over whether it is a good idea to open a new rug store in Glendale. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Mario believes that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale, and therefore opening a new rug store there would be a bad idea. Renate disagrees and argues that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold, and that it is possible to open a successful rug store in Glendale. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Mario thinks that it is not a good idea because the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business, indicating little demand for rugs in that area. Renate, on the other hand, believes that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold and that it is still possible to open a successful rug store in Glendale. None of the other options are discussed in the dialogue.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

The dialogue suggests that Mario thinks that rugs are not a good product to sell in Glendale because there is little demand for them, while Renate disagrees and suggests that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, the disagreement is about whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. 

A, C, D, and E are not supported by the dialogue.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The disagreement between Mario and Renate is about whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Mario argues that because the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business, there must be little demand for rugs in the area. Renate disagrees and argues that the closing of the store had little to do with the product it sold.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Mario suggests that the only rug store in Glendale went out of business because there is little demand for rugs in Glendale, and therefore recommends avoiding rugs as a product if opening a new business. Renate, on the other hand, disagrees, and suggests that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold. This implies that Renate thinks it might still be a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale, despite the fact that the only existing one went out of business. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Hence, the correct answer is B.
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument is trying to show that it is misguided to consider H pylori a commensal based on the fact that it can cause stomach ulcers even though it strengthens the immune response. The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis and states that M tuberculosis is not a commensal even though only about 10 percent of the people who harbor it get sick from it.

A: This statement does not affect the argument's reasoning; it is about the treatment of the diseases and not about whether or not the bacteria are commensals.
B: This statement does not affect the argument's reasoning; it is about the duration of the diseases and not about whether or not the bacteria are commensals.
C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning; it states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which is the opposite of what is claimed about H pylori.
D: This statement does not affect the argument's reasoning; it is about the number of people who harbor the bacteria and not about whether or not the bacteria are commensals.
E: This statement supports the argument's reasoning; it states that there are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis, which weakens the claim that the two bacteria should be considered similarly.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that H pylori should not be considered a commensal bacteria even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response, because it causes stomach ulcers in a higher percentage of people who harbor it than the percentage of people who get sick from M tuberculosis. The argument implies that the fact that only about 10 percent of those who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it is not enough to consider it a commensal. 
A: This statement does not undermine the argument as it does not address the reasoning behind it.
B: This statement also does not undermine the argument as it compares the duration of two different illnesses but does not address the reasoning behind the argument.
C: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning by providing an example of a bacteria that is not considered a commensal, even though most people who harbor it do not get sick from it and it does not provide any benefits to the host.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning as it does not address the percentage of people who get sick from M tuberculosis or H pylori.
E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning as it does not address the percentage of people who get sick from M tuberculosis or H pylori.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal just because it strengthens the immune response and only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of cases, while M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal even though only about 10% of those who harbor it get sick from it.
  A: This information is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This information is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This choice provides an alternative explanation for why M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal, which suggests that the argument's reasoning is flawed in comparing the two bacteria.
  D: This information is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This information is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens immune response and only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of those who harbor it.
- The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample, since only about 10% of those who harbor it get sick, but no one would call it a commensal.
- The argument implies that the fact that only a small percentage of people get sick from H pylori is not enough to classify it as a commensal.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: 
If people who harbor M tuberculosis do derive a benefit from its presence, then it is possible that M tuberculosis could be considered a commensal, which would weaken the author's argument that just because only a small percentage of people get sick from H pylori does not mean it is a commensal. Therefore, C most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning. The other answer choices are not relevant to the argument.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Helicobacter pylori should not be considered a commensal despite allegedly strengthening immune response because it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers.
  The counter-example given is that Mycobacter tuberculosis is not considered a commensal despite only about 10% of those who harbor it getting sick from it.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
  Choice C undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that people who harbor M tuberculosis do not derive any benefit from it, unlike the supposed immune-strengthening benefit of H pylori. This demonstrates that the argument's claim that H pylori should not be considered a commensal solely based on its role in causing stomach ulcers is flawed because there are other factors to consider when determining whether a bacterium is a commensal or not. The other choices are either irrelevant to the argument's reasoning or do not provide a significant counter-example to the argument's claim.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether or not H pylori should be considered a commensal bacteria, even though it plays a role in the development of stomach ulcers.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis.
  The argument states that only about 10% of people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it.
Choice:
  A: This statement might be interesting, but doesn't really address the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement might be interesting, but doesn't really address the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning by stating that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: This statement might be interesting, but doesn't really address the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement might be interesting, but doesn't really address the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal despite the fact that it only causes ulcers in less than 10% of people who harbor it.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis, but only about 10% of people who harbor it get sick from it.
A: This choice does not affect the argument's reasoning, as the effectiveness of treatment for the two diseases is not relevant to the argument.
B: This choice also does not affect the argument's reasoning, as the duration of the diseases is not relevant to the argument.
C: This choice seriously undermines the argument's reasoning, as it suggests that the definition of a commensal is not solely based on whether a person benefits from the presence of a bacterium, but also whether a person derives no harm from it.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument, as the number of people who harbor each bacterium is not relevant to the argument.
E: This choice is also not relevant to the argument, as the number of people who harbor each bacterium is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about whether Helicobacter pylori should be considered a commensal despite its role in causing stomach ulcers. It compares this to Mycobacter tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal despite only causing disease in about 10% of those who harbor it.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument being made.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument being made.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning, as it suggests that M tuberculosis does not provide any benefit to those who harbor it.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument being made.
  E: This statement seriously undermines the argument's reasoning, as it suggests that the prevalence of the bacteria is an important factor in whether they should be considered commensals.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal even though only a small percentage of people with it develop stomach ulcers.
  M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal even though only a small percentage of people with it get sick.
A: This statement does not address the argument that the reasoning for considering H pylori a commensal is misguided.
B: This statement also does not address the argument that the reasoning for considering H pylori a commensal is misguided.
C: This statement supports the argument that M tuberculosis is not a commensal, but it does not undermine the reasoning for considering H pylori a commensal.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that H pylori should be considered a commensal since it is more prevalent than M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal even though it has a similar low rate of causing illness. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori cannot be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens immune response and only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of those who harbor it. This is because Mycobacter tuberculosis can also be present in people without causing illness, but it would not be considered a commensal. 
  A: This statement provides information about the treatment of the conditions but it does not relate to the reasoning of the argument. 
  B: This statement provides information about the duration of the conditions but it does not relate to the reasoning of the argument. 
  C: This statement contradicts the idea that commensals provide a benefit to the host, which undermines the argument's reasoning.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances and they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: The polar bear stopping and changing course several times as it moved toward its home territory does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it is more likely that the polar bear returned to its home territory due to its familiarity with the surrounding area rather than by using navigation skills.
  C: The fact that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  D: The fact that other species of mammals can find their way home from considerable distances does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  E: The fact that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ability of polar bears to navigate over considerable distances.
  A: This statement suggests that the polar bear had some difficulty in finding its way home, but it does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  B: This statement suggests that the polar bear may have used its normal migratory route to return home, rather than relying on its navigational abilities.
  C: This statement provides some information about the conditions of the polar bear's journey, but it does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  D: This statement suggests that the ability to navigate over considerable distances is not unique to polar bears, but it does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  E: This statement provides information about how polar bears use their senses to navigate, but it does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances, and cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: The fact that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, this may have helped the bear to return to its home territory, casting doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  C: The fact that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the ability of polar bears to navigate over considerable distances.
  Naturalists cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away as evidence.
  A: The fact that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim. The polar bear could have been making necessary adjustments to its navigation based on new sensory information.
  B: The fact that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route could actually support the naturalists' claim, as the bear could be expected to have developed a cognitive map of the area through repeated passage over time.
  C: The fact that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim. If anything, it could reinforce the naturalists' claim by highlighting the limited sensory information available to the polar bear.
  D: The fact that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim, as the argument is specific to polar bears. 
  E: The fact that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim. The polar bear could have used its sense of smell in combination with other navigational cues to find its way home.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer, and that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, while sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. The argument also cites evidence in support of this claim.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as the argument is not concerned with the trend of fther consumption in different countries over time.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument, as the argument is only concerned with the relationship between fther and colon cancer, not the risk of other types of cancer.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not discuss the difficulty of including fther in people's diets.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not compare the fther content of different types of foods.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  The argument also claims that the colon cancer rate in Western countries is higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables.
  Furthermore, in Scandinavia, it has been shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 

Action: Answer("D")
The argument does not consider the possibility that the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have different cancer-fighting properties. Therefore, it is possible that the argument's conclusion is too simplistic and does not take into account the complexities of the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence. It also claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument focuses only on colon cancer and does not mention other types of cancer. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument.
C: The argument does not address whether fiber-rich foods are difficult to include in people's diets. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not address whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument.
E: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument because the argument does not address whether foods containing fiber also contain other substances that may prevent colon cancer. This means that the argument overlooks the possibility that other factors may be responsible for the negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. It uses the incidence of colon cancer rates in Western and non-Western countries, as well as the relationship between colon cancer rates and the consumption of cereals, to support its claim.
A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not, so this is not a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
B: The argument only focuses on the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer, and does not address the risk of other types of cancer, so this is not a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
C: The argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets, so this is not a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
D: The argument does not address whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees, so this is not a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
E: This could be a potential criticism of the argument's reasoning, as it suggests that the protective effect of fiber against colon cancer may be due to other substances in the foods that contain fiber. However, this is not explicitly stated in the argument. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
  The argument supports its claim with evidence of a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer, as well as evidence that the colon cancer rate is lower in areas where people consume more fiber-rich foods.
Choices:
  A: The fact that the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably is not relevant to the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  B: The argument's claim is specifically about colon cancer and fiber, so evidence that high-fiber diets reduce the risk of other types of cancer is not relevant.
  C: The argument does not address the difficulty of including fiber in one's diet, but rather focuses on the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  D: The argument does not distinguish between the types of fiber found in fruits and vegetables versus cereals, but rather treats fiber as a homogeneous category.
  E: This is a plausible criticism of the argument, as it is possible that other substances in foods containing fiber contribute to the prevention of colon cancer, rather than or in addition to fiber itself. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  Western countries have a higher incidence of colon cancer than many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not is irrelevant to the argument, which is about the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
B: The argument is only concerned with the relationship between fiber and colon cancer, not the relationship between fiber and other types of cancer.
C: The argument does not consider whether or not fiber is difficult for people to include in their diets, and this is not relevant to the claim that fiber prevents colon cancer.
D: This possibility is not necessarily a criticism of the argument, but rather a refinement of it. The argument does not claim that the fiber in all foods has the same cancer-fighting properties.
E: This possibility is a potential criticism of the argument, as it suggests that the relationship between fiber and colon cancer may be more complex than the argument suggests. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rates. It also claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
  A: The argument only talks about the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates, and does not address whether fiber consumption is rising or falling in any country. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This choice is not relevant to the argument because the argument only talks about the relationship between fiber and colon cancer, not other types of cancer.
  C: The argument does not consider whether fiber is difficult for people to include in their diets. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument.
  D: The argument does not distinguish between the types of fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument because it suggests that the relationship between fiber and colon cancer is more complex than the argument suggests, and that other substances in fiber-containing foods may also play a role in preventing colon cancer.

Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer, and that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer while sufficient consumption prevents it. 
A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably or not, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument only discusses the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
C: The argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets or not, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument does not address whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have different cancer-fighting properties, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
E: This choice presents a possibility that the argument overlooks; the argument only discusses the relationship between fiber and colon cancer and does not address whether foods containing fiber also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer or not. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer, citing examples such as the colon cancer rate being lower in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods like fruits and vegetables, and Scandinavia where areas with lower consumption of cereals (which are high in fiber) have higher colon cancer rates. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. Even if the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising, it doesn't address the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
B: This statement is a potential strengthener of the argument, not a criticism. It suggests that high-fiber diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer, which supports the argument's claim that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer.
C: This statement is a potential objection to the argument, but it doesn't address a key assumption or premise of the argument. Even if fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets, it doesn't necessarily mean that the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer is false.
D: This statement is a potential objection to the argument, but it doesn't directly address the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
E: This statement is a potential strengthener of the argument, not a criticism. It suggests that foods containing fiber also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer, which supports the argument's claim that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. The argument provides evidence to support this claim, including studies that show a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rates in different countries.
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the argument is not concerned with whether fiber consumption is increasing or decreasing.
B: This statement, even if true, does not address the argument's claim that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not address the difficulty of including fiber in one's diet.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not distinguish between the fiber content of different foods.
E: This statement is a possible criticism of the argument, as it suggests that other substances in high-fiber foods may be responsible for the negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rates, rather than fiber itself.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known
  E: takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist obtained a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group, and the representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. The journalist argues that because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is not a member of the trade group. However, the journalist's reasoning is flawed.
  
A: The journalist's argument is not about whether Bruch Industries wants to belong to the trade group, so this choice is not relevant.
B: This choice is the best answer. The journalist assumes that the document names every member of the trade group, but there may be other members who were not included on the document.
C: This choice is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
D: The journalist's argument is not about why Bruch Industries would want its membership in the trade group to be known, so this choice is not relevant.
E: The representative of the trade group may not be reliable in confirming that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group, so this choice is a possible flaw in the journalist's reasoning, but it is not the best answer because the question asks for the flaw that is most relevant to the journalist's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies, which was inadvertently sent by a manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret. 
  A representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. 
  Bruch Industries is not listed on the document.
  
  A: This is irrelevant to the journalist's reasoning about membership in the trade group and does not affect the accuracy of the conclusion.
  B: This is a possible flaw in the journalist's reasoning. The document may not name every member of the trade group, so it is possible that Bruch Industries is still a member. However, this is not the only flaw in the reasoning.
  C: This is also irrelevant to the journalist's reasoning about membership in the trade group and does not affect the accuracy of the conclusion.
  D: This is irrelevant to the journalist's reasoning about membership in the trade group and does not affect the accuracy of the conclusion.
  E: This is a possible flaw in the journalist's reasoning. The accuracy of the representative's statement cannot be assumed, as the representative had a reason to withhold information and may not be trustworthy. However, this is not the only flaw in the reasoning.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The journalist received a document from a manufacturers' trade group that listed hundreds of manufacturing companies, and a representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document is a member of the trade group. However, Bruch Industries is not listed in the document. The journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group.
A: The journalist's argument is not flawed on the basis of whether Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group or not. The argument is about whether Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group or not, based on the evidence presented.
B: The journalist's argument assumes that the document lists every member of the trade group. If the document is not complete, it is possible that Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group even though it is not listed in the document.
C: The argument is not about how the document was sent out, but about whether Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group or not.
D: The argument is not about why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known, but about whether it is a member of the trade group or not, based on the evidence presented.
E: The journalist assumes that the representative's statement is accurate. It is possible that the representative is mistaken or lying, or that there is some other reason why Bruch Industries is not listed in the document.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group.
  The representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, so the journalist concludes that it is not a member of the trade group.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The journalist's reasoning is flawed because the journalist does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group. It is possible that Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group but was simply not included on the list for some reason. Therefore, the conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group is not necessarily valid.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group.
  The representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, so it is not a member of the trade group according to the journalist's conclusion.
A: The journalist's argument is not about whether Bruch Industries wants to belong to the trade group or not, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: The journalist states that the representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group, so this choice is incorrect.
C: The journalist's argument is not about how the trade group sent out the document, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: The journalist's argument is not about why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
E: The journalist takes for granted the accuracy of the representative's statement and does not question it, so this choice correctly identifies a flaw in the journalist's reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument presented by the journalist is based on the assumption that the document sent to him/her is a complete and accurate list of all the members of the trade group. 

A: This choice is irrelevant to the journalist's argument about Bruch Industries not being a member of the trade group.
B: This choice is the correct answer. The journalist's argument is based on the assumption that the document lists every member of the trade group, which is not necessarily true.
C: This choice is also irrelevant to the journalist's argument about Bruch Industries not being a member of the trade group.
D: This choice is also irrelevant to the journalist's argument about Bruch Industries not being a member of the trade group.
E: This choice is not accurate as the journalist's argument is based on a document sent by the trade group, not just the representative's statement.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies that belong to the trade group.
  A representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed on the document.
  
  A: The belonging or not belonging of Bruch Industries to the trade group is not relevant to this choice.
  B: The journalist has presented evidence that the document names every member of the trade group by mentioning that the representative confirmed that every company on the document belongs to the trade group.
  C: The journalist does not need to explain how the trade group inadvertently sent out a secret document, as it is not relevant to the argument.
  D: The journalist does not need to present a reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known, as it is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This choice suggests that the representative might not be trustworthy, but there is no evidence presented to support this. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document that lists hundreds of manufacturing companies that belong to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed on the document.
  The representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group.

Action: Answer("B")

The journalist's reasoning is flawed because the argument assumes that the document names every member of the trade group, but there is no evidence presented in the argument to support that assumption. Therefore, it is possible that Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group but was simply not listed on the document that was inadvertently sent to the journalist.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret.
  A representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed on the document.
  
Analysis:
  The journalist assumes that the document lists all the members of the trade group and that there are no omissions. This assumption is not valid because there is no evidence that the list is complete. It is possible that Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group but was accidentally omitted from the list. Therefore, the journalist's conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document from a manufacturers' trade group that inadvertently listed the names of hundreds of manufacturing companies, and a representative confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. Bruch Industries is not listed in the document.

Action: Answer("B")

The journalist's reasoning is flawed because the document may not have listed every member of the trade group. The fact that Bruch Industries is not listed on the document does not necessarily mean that it is not a member of the trade group. Therefore, the journalist's conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group is not necessarily true. Choice B correctly identifies this flaw in the journalist's reasoning.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the life expectancy of leatherback sea turtles living in the wild and in captivity.
  The passage notes that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  Despite this, the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is about the same in captivity and in the wild.
  The question asks for the answer that resolves this discrepancy.

Analysis:
  The correct answer will explain why the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity is not significantly shorter than that of wild leatherbacks, despite the fact that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases they would not encounter in the wild.
  (A) and (E) are irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  (B) and (D) do not explain why the life expectancy of captive leatherbacks is not significantly shorter than that of wild leatherbacks.
  (C) is a possible explanation for the discrepancy: leatherbacks living in the wild may be more likely to die from predators than from diseases, so the diseases that afflict captive leatherbacks do not significantly impact their life expectancy.

Action: Answer("C")

B: This statement talks about the average life expectancy of sea turtles in general which doesn't help resolve the discrepancy.
C: This statement talks about the predators that kill leatherbacks in the wild which is irrelevant.
D: This statement discusses zoologists' knowledge of creating a conducive environment for the well-being of captive leatherbacks which is irrelevant to resolve the discrepancy.
E: If the size of a leatherback is not a trustworthy indicator of its age, then it could explain the apparent discrepancy mentioned in the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherback turtles are susceptible to diseases when subjected to captivity, which would not happen in the wild. Yet, their life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  C: This statement may help explain why leatherbacks have the same life expectancy in captivity and in the wild, but it does not directly address why they get sick in captivity.
  D: This statement does not help to resolve the discrepancy.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases but still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those living in the wild.
A: This statement does not address the discrepancy in the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity versus the wild.
B: This statement provides interesting information about sea turtles in general, but it does not address the discrepancy in the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity versus the wild.
C: This statement provides important information about the dangers that leatherbacks face in the wild, but it does not address the discrepancy in the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity versus the wild.
D: This answer choice might help explain why captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases, but it does not address the discrepancy in the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity versus the wild.
E: If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, then this could help explain the apparent discrepancy between the life expectancy of wild and captive leatherbacks.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity that they would not encounter in the wild, yet their life expectancy is about the same in captivity and in the wild.
A: This fact does not help to explain the apparent discrepancy between the susceptibility of leatherbacks to fatal diseases in captivity and their life expectancy in the wild.
B: This fact provides information about the life expectancy of sea turtles in general, but it does not help to explain the apparent discrepancy between the susceptibility of leatherbacks to fatal diseases in captivity and their life expectancy in the wild.
C: This fact provides information about the cause of death of most leatherbacks in the wild, but it does not help to explain the apparent discrepancy between the susceptibility of leatherbacks to fatal diseases in captivity and their life expectancy in the wild.
D: This fact suggests a possible reason why leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but it does not help to explain why their life expectancy is about the same in captivity and in the wild.
E: If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, then it could help explain why the life expectancy of leatherbacks is about the same in captivity and in the wild despite the susceptibility of leatherbacks to fatal diseases in captivity.
Action: Answer("E")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with mass between planets and stars.
  Lithium is present in the atmospheres of some celestial objects.
  Lithium in stars with at least as much mass as the Sun is not consumed because of incomplete mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces.
  Lithium in stars with less mass than the Sun is consumed because it has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces.
  Brown dwarfs do not have fully functional nuclear furnaces and therefore their lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("B")  
The journalist's statements most strongly support option B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Lithium is present in the atmospheres of stars at least as massive as the Sun because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
  
  A: The journalist does not make a statement about all celestial objects without lithium in their atmosphere. Only stars with less mass than the Sun are mentioned.
  B: The journalist states that stars with at least the mass of the Sun have lithium in their atmospheres because their nuclear furnaces have not fully mixed. However, the journalist does not make a statement about celestial objects with lithium in their atmospheres.
  C: The journalist does not make this statement, as they explain that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because it has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed, not because they are brown dwarfs.
  D: The journalist does not make this statement, as they explain that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium in their atmospheres, but do not specify the maximum mass of celestial objects with lithium in their atmospheres.
  E: The journalist does not make this statement, as they explain that brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and therefore their lithium cannot be consumed, but do not specify the minimum mass of celestial objects with lithium in their atmospheres.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("B") 
The journalist states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Therefore, any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. This is the most strongly supported statement among the choices.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  - Brown dwarfs have lithium in their atmospheres because their nuclear furnaces are not fully functional, which prevents the consumption of lithium.
  - Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  - Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.

Action: Answer("B") 
According to the science journalist's statements, any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. This statement is strongly supported because the journalist explains that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Brown dwarfs, on the other hand, have lithium in their atmospheres because they do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace that would allow them to consume the lithium. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Lithium in the atmosphere of a celestial object indicates that the object has not completed the mixing of elements in its internal nuclear furnace.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium in their atmospheres.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and retain lithium in their atmospheres.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The science journalist's statements indicate that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. This statement is supported by the fact that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Brown dwarfs, which do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace, also retain lithium in their atmospheres. Therefore, choice B is the most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with mass between planets and stars.
  Lithium is present in the atmosphere of stars at least as massive as the Sun.
  Lithium is not present in the atmosphere of stars with less mass than the Sun.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and therefore they have lithium in their atmosphere.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The science journalist states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because their nuclear furnaces are incomplete. Therefore, any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs cannot consume lithium because they do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  
  A: The journalist's statement does not support this option. We know that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, but not all celestial objects without lithium in their atmosphere are stars with less mass than the Sun.
  B: The journalist's statement supports this option. The presence of lithium in an object's atmosphere is indicative of a nuclear furnace that has not completely mixed the object's elements.
  C: The journalist's statement does not support this option. We know that brown dwarfs cannot consume lithium because they do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace, but there may be other celestial objects without lithium in their atmosphere that are not brown dwarfs.
  D: The journalist's statement does not support this option. We know that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres, but there may be other celestial objects with lithium that have more or less mass than the Sun.
  E: The journalist's statement supports this option. We know that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere, because brown dwarfs cannot consume lithium and they have more mass than planets.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories had been sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have decreased, but because the inflation rate increased, the party's theories were flawed.
Choices:
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of changes in architecture in the valley means that the valley people were not invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the workers' promise not to strike means that they do not fear the opposition party's promise to cut wages.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the failure of the stock price to increase means that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the residents' support for the rebels means that the rebels won the battle.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the decrease in the station's ratings means that the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument presented in the passage assumes that a correct economic program would have led to a decrease in inflation rates, and since inflation rates increased, the program was flawed.
A: This argument assumes that changes in the valley's architecture would have occurred if the valley's people had been invaded or if there had been a dramatic climactic change. However, no changes in the valley's architecture were observed, so the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay. This is a flawed argument based on the assumption of a causal relationship.
B: This argument assumes that because workers promised not to strike, they must think that the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This is a flawed argument based on the assumption of a causal relationship.
C: This argument assumes that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This is a flawed argument based on the assumption of a causal relationship.
D: This argument assumes that residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels if the battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle. This is a flawed argument based on the assumption of a causal relationship.
E: This argument assumes that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This is a flawed argument based on the assumption of a causal relationship.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument in the context presents a hypothetical situation that did not come to pass. The conclusion drawn is that the economic theories were far off the mark because the inflation rate actually increased, which contradicted their expectations.
A: The argument presents a hypothetical situation that did not come to pass, but it uses it to draw a conclusion about a different aspect of the situation.
B: The argument presents a hypothetical situation, but it uses it to draw a conclusion about the beliefs of the workers, rather than the accuracy of the initial prediction.
C: The argument presents a hypothetical situation that did not come to pass, but it uses it to draw a conclusion about a different aspect of the situation.
D: The argument presents a hypothetical situation that did not come to pass, but it uses it to draw a conclusion about the outcome of the battle.
E: The argument presents a hypothetical situation that did not come to pass, and it uses it to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of the new equipment, which did not come to pass.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories had been sound and implemented correctly, the inflation rate would have decreased. However, the inflation rate actually increased, so the argument concludes that the party's economic theories missed the mark.
  A: This argument states that if the valley people had been invaded or there had been a climatic change, the architecture would have changed. However, the architecture remained the same throughout their stay, so the argument concludes that the valley people were not invaded during their stay.
  B: This argument states that if the opposition party wins the election and cuts wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. However, the workers have promised not to strike, so the argument concludes that these workers must not believe the party will keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: This argument states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. However, the price of the stock did not increase in that time, so the argument concludes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: This argument states that city residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels if the battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days, so the argument concludes that the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: This argument states that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. However, the station's ratings actually decreased, so the argument concludes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old.  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
The argument above assumes that because the party's economic theories did not work in practice, the theories themselves must have been flawed. However, there could be many reasons why the theories did not work, such as lack of resources or unforeseen external factors. 
A: This argument assumes that because there were no changes in the valley's architecture, the valley people were never invaded. However, it is possible that the valley people were invaded but chose not to change their architecture.
B: This argument assumes that because workers promised not to strike, they do not think the opposition party will keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. However, there could be other reasons why workers promised not to strike.
C: This argument assumes that because the stock price did not increase in the last two years, the company failed to sell its subsidiaries. However, there could be other reasons why the stock price did not increase.
D: This argument assumes that because city residents have shown support for the rebels for the last three days, the rebels must have won the battle. However, there could be other reasons why city residents are showing support for the rebels.
E: This argument assumes that because the station's ratings actually decreased, the new equipment is no improvement on the old. However, there could be other reasons why the ratings decreased.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument above assumes that the party's economic theories were sound and that their implementation would have led to a decrease in inflation. However, because the inflation rate actually increased, the argument concludes that the party's economic theories were flawed. This is an example of flawed reasoning known as affirming the consequent.
A: This argument presents a conditional statement, but it does not assume that the consequent is true and then conclude that the antecedent is also true. Thus, it does not resemble the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
B: This argument presents a conditional statement, but it does not assume that the consequent is true and then conclude that the antecedent is also true. Thus, it does not resemble the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
C: This argument presents a conditional statement, but it does not assume that the consequent is true and then conclude that the antecedent is also true. Thus, it does not resemble the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
D: This argument assumes that if the residents show a great deal of support, then the rebels must have won the battle. This is an example of flawed reasoning known as affirming the consequent, which is similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
E: This argument presents a conditional statement, but it does not assume that the consequent is true and then conclude that the antecedent is also true. Thus, it does not resemble the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument above concludes that the party's economic theories were flawed because the inflation rate increased instead of decreasing as predicted.
Choices:
  A: This argument presents a similar structure of 'if X had happened, Y would have been the result. But Y did not happen, thus X must not have happened either.' However, this argument deals with changes in architecture in response to a hypothetical invasion, whereas the argument above deals with economic theories and inflation rates.
  B: This argument also presents a similar structure of 'if X happens, Y will be the result. But Y did not happen, thus X must not happen either.' However, this argument deals with the fear of striking workers in response to a political promise, whereas the argument above deals with economic theories and inflation rates.
  C: This argument presents a similar structure of 'if X had happened, Y would have been the result. But Y did not happen, thus X must not have happened either.' However, this argument deals with the stock price of a company in response to the sale of its subsidiaries, whereas the argument above deals with economic theories and inflation rates.
  D: This argument presents a different flawed reasoning structure in which it concludes that the rebels won the battle because residents showed support for the rebels, despite not providing any evidence that the battle had actually been won.
  E: This argument presents a similar structure of 'if X had happened, Y would have been the result. But Y did not happen, thus X must not have happened either.' However, this argument deals with the accuracy of weather forecasting equipment in response to investment, whereas the argument above deals with economic theories and inflation rates.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above states that the inflation rate increased, which means the party's economic theories were wrong.
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of changes in architecture means the valley people were not invaded, without considering other possible reasons why the architecture remained the same.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the workers promise not to strike because they think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut, without considering other possible reasons for their promise.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason the stock price would have doubled is if the company had sold its subsidiaries and purchased the new patent, without considering other possible reasons for a stock price increase.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the residents' support for the rebels means the rebels won the battle, without considering other possible reasons for their support.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason the ratings would have risen is if the new equipment was worth the investment, without considering other possible reasons for a rise or fall in ratings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The argument above assumes that because the party's economic theories were off the mark, they were responsible for the increase in inflation rate. This is a flawed reasoning because the argument ignores other possible factors that may have contributed to the increase in inflation rate.
A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of evidence is evidence of absence. Just because there were no changes in the valley's architecture doesn't mean that the valley people were never invaded.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the workers' promise not to strike is proof that they don't fear the opposition party's promise of a dramatic wage cut.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only way the company's stock price could have doubled is if it had sold its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the residents' support is proof that the rebels won the battle.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only way the new equipment could have been worth the investment is if it had improved the station's ratings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above assumes that the party's economic theories were sound and that it had a program to lessen the inflation rate. However, it failed to do so and the inflation rate increased. Therefore, the argument concludes that the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
  A: This argument assumes that the valley people were not invaded because the architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. However, it fails to consider that the valley people could have had other reasons for not changing their architecture.
  B: This argument assumes that the workers will not strike because they have promised not to strike. However, it fails to consider that the workers may have other reasons for not striking.
  C: This argument assumes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries because the stock price did not increase in the last two years. However, it fails to consider that other factors could have affected the stock price.
  D: This argument assumes that the residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels because the rebels have won the battle. However, it fails to consider that the residents could have other reasons for showing support for the rebels.
  E: This argument assumes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old because the station's ratings actually decreased. However, it fails to consider that other factors could have affected the station's ratings.

  The statement mentions that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  The statement mentions that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
  The argument discusses the reasons why foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries. One of the reasons given is that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. Therefore, if a foreign citizen is appointed as a cabinet undersecretary, this would create a potential problem if they had to serve as a cabinet secretary. This makes it logical to conclude that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument states that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. The official provides support for this claim by stating that certain duties of cabinet secretaries can only be performed by citizens. The official also suggests that a cabinet undersecretary may be required to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Analysis: Option A is not relevant to the argument. Option B is not supported by the argument, which suggests that undersecretaries are expected to serve as secretaries when necessary. Option C is not applicable to the argument, which does not provide any support for this claim. Option D contradicts the argument, which suggests that some duties of cabinet secretaries can only be performed by citizens.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Response 0:

A: This principle emphasizes international agreement to regulate national resources when wildlife is endangered. It does not support either commission's position.
B: This principle emphasizes the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved over individual nations' economic needs. It supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
C: This principle emphasizes the need for regulation only when a reduction in endangered species populations has been found. It does not support either commission's position.
D: This principle emphasizes that environment regulation must aim to prevent any further environmental damage and cannot allow for different degrees of harm by different nations. It supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
E: This principle emphasizes that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources. It does not support either commission's position.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development by requiring replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission wants to allow wetland development, arguing that it might not affect wildlife and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position implies that economic growth is more important than wildlife conservation.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Option D suggests that environmental regulation must prevent any further environmental damage and cannot take into account the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. This principle would support the Figorian Development Commission's position, which argues that they have the right to govern their own resources and that wetland development is necessary for growth. It suggests that Figoria should not be held to a higher standard than other nations that have already harmed their environment through commercial development.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Figorian Wildlife Commission advocates for the regulation of wetland development in Figoria to protect wildlife and suggests the construction of replacement wetland habitats to offset future development.
  Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria has conserved wetlands thus far and that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, so it should be allowed.
  A: The principle of international agreement for the regulation of national resources would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it would mean that Figorian development would be regulated and that other countries would have a say in Figoria's regulation.
  B: The principle of prioritizing the preservation of wildlife over the economic needs of nations would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position and not the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  C: The principle of regulation after damage has been done would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it would mean that damage has already occurred, and the Figorian Development Commission argues that wetland development might not affect wildlife.
  D: The principle of preventing any further environmental damage cannot allow for different degrees of past harm would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it suggests that Figoria should be regulated to prevent any further environmental damage.
  E: The principle of depletion of natural resources is a general statement that does not address whether Figorian wetland development is necessary for growth or if it might affect wildlife.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission advocates for regulating wetland development in Figoria to protect wildlife by offsetting development with replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission advocates for allowing wetland development in Figoria, arguing that it might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that Figoria has as much right to govern its own resources as other countries.
  A: This principle supports international regulation of national resources when wildlife is endangered, which does not directly support either position.
  B: This principle prioritizes preserving wildlife over economic needs, which directly opposes the Figorian Development Commission's position but supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  C: This principle suggests implementing regulations only after a reduction of endangered species populations has been found, which does not directly support either position.
  D: This principle suggests that regulation should aim to prevent any further damage, which directly opposes the Figorian Development Commission's position but supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  E: This principle suggests that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources, which does not directly support either position.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:

  The Figorian Wildlife Commission advocates for the regulation of wetland development and the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife. 
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  
A: This principle would support international regulation to protect wildlife, which is in line with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position. It does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  B: This principle prioritizes the preservation of wildlife over economic needs, which is in line with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position. It does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  C: This principle would only regulate commercial development if there is already a reduction of endangered species, which is not in line with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position. It is not clear if it supports the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  D: This principle aims to prevent any further environmental damage and does not allow for different degrees of environmental harm, which is in line with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position. It does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  E: This principle argues against depletion of natural resources, but it is not clear how it aligns with either commission's position.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development should be regulated in order to protect wildlife by offsetting it with the construction of replacement wetland habitats, while the Figorian Development Commission argues that they should be allowed to develop wetlands as necessary for growth and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
A: This principle suggests that international agreement is necessary to regulate national resources when wildlife is endangered, which supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
B: This principle suggests that the preservation of wildlife supersedes the economic needs of individual nations, which supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
C: This principle suggests that regulation should only be implemented once a reduction in populations of endangered species has been found, which does not support either position.
D: This principle suggests that environmental regulation cannot allow for different degrees of environmental damage, which supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
E: This principle suggests that it is imprudent to further deplete natural resources, but it does not necessarily support either position.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the bill, which most people favor and does not violate anyone's basic human rights, will not be passed for many years, if at all, because the people who would be adversely affected are very influential. Thus, the columnist implies that a well-functioning democracy should pass a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people. Choice B expresses this principle accurately and justifies the columnist's reasoning.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the bill has not been passed into law despite most people favoring it and it not violating anyone's basic human rights because those who would be adversely affected by it are very influential. The principle that best justifies this reasoning is B, which states that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle aligns with the columnist's argument that the bill may not be passed for many years or at all because those who oppose it are very influential. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist argues that if a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate basic human rights is not passed, then the democracy is not well-functioning. Option B captures this idea by stating that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law if the democracy is well-functioning. Therefore, Option B most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist's argument is that the fact that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights may not pass into law if those who oppose it are influential. This reasoning is best captured by choice B, which states that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law if the democracy is well functioning.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the bill, which most people favor and does not violate anyone's basic human rights, will not be passed into law due to the influence of those who would be adversely affected by it. The principle that best justifies this reasoning is that if a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle implies that a well-functioning democracy will enable the majority's preferences to prevail over the minority's opposition, regardless of their level of influence.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist argues that the fact that a bill favored by most people is not passed into law due to the opposition of influential people shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. Option B most helps to justify this reasoning by stating that in a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This implies that if a bill favored by most people does not pass into law, then the democracy is not functioning well. The other options do not address the issue of influential people opposing a bill that is favored by most people.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist is arguing that the fact that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights is not passed because of the opposition of influential people, shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. The principle that supports the columnist's reasoning is that if a democracy is well-functioning, any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle implies that the fact that influential people oppose the bill is a sign of a malfunctioning democracy.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Knowledge: 
  The columnist is arguing that the fact that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate basic human rights is not being passed because of the influence of a small group of people suggests that the country's democracy is not functioning well.
  A: This principle is not supported by the columnist's argument. The columnist is arguing that even though most people favor the bill, it will not be passed and therefore, the country's democracy is not functioning well.
  B: This principle supports the columnist's argument. The columnist is arguing that the bill will not be passed even though it is favored by most people due to the influence of a small group of people. This principle states that in a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: This principle is not supported by the columnist's argument. The columnist is arguing that the bill will not be passed even though it is favored by most people due to the influence of a small group of people. This principle states that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: This principle is not supported by the columnist's argument. The columnist is arguing that the bill will not be passed even though it is favored by most people due to the influence of a small group of people. This principle states that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: This principle is not supported by the columnist's argument. The columnist is arguing that the bill will not be passed even though it is favored by most people due to the influence of a small group of people. This principle states that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist is arguing that the fact that a bill, which most people favor and does not violate anyone's basic human rights, will not be passed into law because the people who would be adversely affected by it are very influential, shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. Option B helps to justify the columnist's reasoning by stating that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This implies that the fact that the bill is not passing into law despite being favored by most people is a sign of dysfunctionality in the democracy.
Response 9:

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed into law because the people who oppose it are very influential. The principle that best justifies this reasoning is that if a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. Therefore, the columnist's argument is that if a bill is not passed into law despite having the support of most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights, it indicates that the democracy is not functioning well.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The biologist argues that humans could be content with a different configuration of fingers, as our current configuration is no more or less useful than other possible configurations. 

A: This choice is irrelevant to the biologist's argument as it does not address whether humans could be content with a different configuration of fingers.
B: This choice weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
C: This choice does not strengthen the biologist's argument as it only makes a general claim about human contentment, which does not necessarily apply to the specific case of finger configuration.
D: This choice supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our finger configuration is based on prejudices, rather than objective assessment.
E: This choice does not strengthen the biologist's argument as it only provides additional information about fish, which is not relevant to the contentment of humans with different finger configurations.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The biologist is arguing that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily better or worse than other possible configurations.
  - The argument is based on the premise that if humans had evolved from a fish with six phalanges in its fins, then having six fingers would be just as useful.
A: This statement does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
B: This statement makes a claim about human behavior, but it is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
C: This statement makes a claim about human behavior, but it is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on any objective criteria, but rather on our prejudices.
E: This statement supports the biologist's argument by providing evidence that a fish with six phalanges in its fins exists, which makes it more likely that humans could have evolved from a fish with six phalanges, and that having six fingers would be just as useful.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that humans could have been content with a different configuration of fingers.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the biologist's argument because it does not address whether humans could be content with a different configuration of fingers.
  B: This statement weakens the biologist's argument because it suggests that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement weakens the biologist's argument because it suggests that humans are always content with things of equal usefulness.
  D: This statement strengthens the biologist's argument because it suggests that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on any objective criteria.
  E: This statement weakly strengthens the biologist's argument because it suggests that the existence of a fish with six phalanges in its fins is possible.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The biologist argues that the configuration of our fingers could have been different if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins. The argument is that there is no inherent usefulness in our current configuration of fingers. 
A: This statement does not provide evidence or support for the biologist's argument. 
B: This statement goes against the idea that there is no inherent usefulness in our current configuration of fingers. 
C: This statement does not provide evidence or support for the biologist's argument. 
D: This statement aligns with the biologist's argument that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on inherent usefulness, but rather on our prejudices. 
E: This statement supports the biologist's argument that there are fish with different configurations of fins, which indicates that it is possible for humans to have a different configuration of fingers. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The biologist is arguing that humans having five fingers is not due to usefulness, but rather due to evolutionary history.
  A: This does not support the biologist's argument, and it could actually weaken it if it were found to be false.
  B: This statement is too broad and does not address the specific argument being made. It is not relevant.
  C: This statement is too broad and does not address the specific argument being made. It is not relevant.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective evidence, but rather on subjective biases.
  E: This statement supports the biologist's argument by providing an example of a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins, which suggests that different numbers of fingers could have evolved in humans.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
Biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. Therefore, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
A: This answer choice doesn't give any additional information that would strengthen the biologist's argument.
B: This answer choice is not related to the argument made by the biologist.
C: This answer choice is consistent with the biologist's argument, but it doesn't strengthen the argument.
D: This answer choice supports the biologist's argument that our perception of the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is biased.
E: This answer choice strengthens the biologist's argument by providing an example of a fish with six phalanges in its fins, which supports the possibility that humans could have descended from such a fish.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand, and that we would be content with any configuration that we evolved from.
  A: This statement provides no evidence to support the biologist's argument, and it actually undermines the biologist's argument by suggesting that present contentment is why our configuration of fingers is useful.
  B: This statement suggests that humans are not content with the less useful of two options, which undermines the biologist's argument that humans would be content with any configuration of fingers.
  C: This statement supports the biologist's argument, but it is too general and absolute to be a realistic claim.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is a result of our prejudices, rather than any inherent superiority in the five-fingered configuration.
  E: This statement does not directly support the biologist's argument, but it provides evidence that the possibility of evolving from fish with six phalanges in their fins is plausible, which strengthens the biologist's argument.

  C: The claim that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness is not supported by any evidence and is not relevant to the argument.
  D: If the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices, this would support the biologist's argument that there is nothing inherently better about our current configuration of fingers.
  E: If at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, this would support the biologist's claim that humans could have had six fingers per hand if our ancestor had had six phalanges in its fins.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not predetermined and is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, and that our contentment with our current configuration is due to our prejudices towards it.
  A: This statement does not add any evidence to support the biologist's argument that the number of fingers humans have is not predetermined and is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.

A: This answer choice is similar to the argument, but it is too broad. It does not only refer to parsley, but all fresh ingredients.
B: This answer choice is too extreme. The argument does not state that only the tastiest ingredients should be used, but rather that dried parsley should not be used.
C: This answer choice is too extreme. The argument does not state that ingredients that should never be used are never tasty or healthful. It only makes a claim about dried parsley.
D: This answer choice is too extreme. The argument does not state that parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used. It only makes a claim about dried parsley.
E: This answer choice most closely aligns with the argument. The argument claims that dried parsley is less tasty and less healthful than fresh parsley, which implies that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.

Therefore, the best answer is E.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries rather than one of the accountants because the accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. 

A: The argument is not weakened by the fact that the actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants. If anything, this strengthens the argument by suggesting that it would have been more difficult for an actuary to embezzle funds without being detected.

B: This statement weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that someone outside of XYZ Corporation could have had access to the internal financial records. If this were the case, then it is possible that the embezzler was not an accountant or an actuary at XYZ Corporation.

C: This statement does not weaken the detective's argument. Although it provides information about the number of accountants and actuaries at XYZ Corporation, it does not address the likelihood of whether the embezzler is an accountant or an actuary.

D: This statement does not weaken the detective's argument. Although it suggests that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, it does not address the likelihood of whether the embezzler is an accountant or an actuary.

E: This statement weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that the actuaries had less access to internal financial records than the accountants. If this were the case, then it is less likely that an actuary would have been able to embezzle funds.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The detective argues that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary, and that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not have made the mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
A: This weakens the detective's argument because if the activities of the accountants were more closely scrutinized, it suggests that an accountant could have embezzled money without being detected.
B: This weakens the detective's argument because if someone outside of XYZ Corporation had access to the internal financial records, it means that the embezzler could have been someone other than an accountant or an actuary working for XYZ Corporation.
C: This does not weaken the detective's argument. The detective's argument is that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because an accountant would not have made the mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. The fact that XYZ Corporation employs more accountants than actuaries does not affect this argument.
D: This does not weaken the detective's argument. The fact that an independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement is not relevant to the argument that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries.
E: This weakens the detective's argument because if certain security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, it suggests that an accountant could have embezzled money without being detected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records. Also, the detective assumes that an accountant would not make mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. 
  
  A: If the actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants, it would be less likely that one of the actuaries committed the crime. This weakens the detective's argument. 
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to internal financial records, it would be possible that someone other than an accountant or actuary committed the crime. This weakens the detective's argument. 
  C: The number of accountants and actuaries employed by XYZ Corporation does not necessarily affect the detective's argument. This is not related to the argument and does not weaken it. 
  D: The independent report concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, which supports the possibility that someone committed the crime. This weakens the detective's argument. 
  E: If the security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, it would be less likely that one of the actuaries committed the crime. This weakens the detective's argument. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries, because an accountant would not make the mistakes that were made in the ledger entries.
  A: This weakens the argument, because it suggests that the accountants may have had the same opportunity to commit the embezzlement as the actuaries.
  B: This weakens the argument, because it suggests that someone outside the company could have committed the embezzlement.
  C: This does not weaken the argument, because it does not address the issue of whether an accountant or an actuary committed the embezzlement.
  D: This does not weaken the argument, because it does not address the issue of whether an accountant or an actuary committed the embezzlement.
  E: This weakens the argument, because it suggests that the actuaries may not have had the same opportunity to commit the embezzlement as the accountants.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler was one of the actuaries because they had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, and an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: This weakens the detective's argument because if the actuaries were more closely scrutinized, then they would have less opportunity to embezzle money.
  B: This weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that someone outside the company could have had access to internal financial records.
  C: This does not weaken the detective's argument because it does not address whether the embezzler was an accountant or an actuary.
  D: This does not weaken the detective's argument because it happened before the crime took place.
  E: This weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that the accountants might have had more access to internal financial records than the actuaries did.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The detective presumes that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: If the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants, then it would be less likely that an actuary could have embezzled money without being detected.
  B: If there is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records, then it is possible that the embezzler was not an employee of the company.
  C: The fact that XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that an accountant could have been the embezzler.
  D: The independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, but this does not weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, then it is less likely that an actuary could have embezzled money.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The detective concludes that the embezzler is likely an actuary based on the assumption that an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: If the supervisors scrutinized the actuaries' activities more closely than the accountants, it would suggest that the actuaries were less likely to have committed the embezzlement, weakening the detective's argument. This option does not weaken the argument.
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to internal financial records, it would suggest that someone other than an accountant or actuary could have committed the embezzlement, weakening the detective's argument.
  C: The number of accountants and actuaries employed by XYZ Corporation is not relevant to the detective's argument.
  D: The independent report concluded before the crime took place does not provide any information about who committed the embezzlement, so it does not weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If the security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, it would suggest that the actuaries were less likely to have committed the embezzlement, weakening the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The detective's argument is based on the assumption that the embezzler is one of the actuaries working for XYZ Corporation because they had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records. The detective also assumes that the accountant would not make mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized by supervisors, it would be less likely that one of them would be the embezzler. This weakens the detective's argument.
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to the internal financial records, it is possible that the embezzler was not an accountant or an actuary. This weakens the detective's argument.
  C: The fact that there are more accountants than actuaries does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument.
  D: The independent report released before the crime took place does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If certain security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records, it is less likely that one of them would be the embezzler. This weakens the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: To weaken an argument means to provide evidence that makes the argument less convincing or less probable. 
  A: This could be seen as a possible reason why an accountant could have committed the embezzlement and not get caught, which actually strengthens the argument. 
  B: This provides an alternative explanation for how someone could have gained access to the records, which also weakens the argument. 
  C: This information doesn't really address the argument, it is just general information about the number of accountants and actuaries at XYZ Corporation. 
  D: This information is about a report done before the crime took place, which doesn't really affect the argument. 
  E: This could be seen as a possible reason why an actuary could not have committed the embezzlement, which actually strengthens the argument. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because accountants would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: If the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized, it would make it less likely that one of them could have embezzled funds without being caught. This weakens the detective's argument, so it is not the correct answer.
  B: If persons outside the corporation had access to the internal financial records, then the embezzler could have been anyone with access to the records, not just an accountant or an actuary. This weakens the detective's argument, so it is not the correct answer.
  C: The number of accountants and actuaries employed by the corporation is not relevant to the detective's argument, so this does not weaken the argument.
  D: The fact that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place does not weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries.

Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.

A: Riley parked his car in the center lane of Main Street, but he did not realize that it could lead to a traffic accident. Therefore, according to the passage, Riley should not be blamed for the accident.
B: Oblicek had no idea that her suggestion would cause the business to go bankrupt, and she could not have reasonably foreseen it. Therefore, according to the passage, Oblicek should not be blamed for the business's bankruptcy.
C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill. However, according to the passage, if Gougon could not have reasonably foreseen that the sauce could make his guests ill, he should not be blamed for it.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, and he did not know that it would cause the patient's blood pressure to increase. Therefore, according to the passage, if no one else knowingly contributed to the patient's increased blood pressure, only Dr. Fitzpatrick should be blamed for it.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which any reasonable person could have foreseen would start a fire. Therefore, even if Kapp did not realize this, she should be blamed for starting the fire on Rodriguez's farm.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The question is asking which scenario is justified by the principle that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it. 

A: Riley parked his car in the center lane of Main Street without realizing that it could lead to a traffic accident. If the accident happens, Riley should not be blamed for it.
B: Oblicek suggested to her brother to take out a loan to expand his business without realizing that it was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt. If the loan causes the bankruptcy, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
C: Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce could make his guests ill but had no reason to think that it would. If the sauce does make his guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine and did not know that it would cause an increase in blood pressure. If no one else contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, only Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm without realizing that it could start a fire. Any reasonable person could have foreseen this. Kapp is to blame for starting the fire.

Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The geologist's argument is that the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence of biomarkers, which indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  A: This weakens the argument that biomarkers are always present in fossils, but doesn't directly address the argument about the origin of petroleum.
  B: This also doesn't directly address the argument about the origin of petroleum.
  C: This actually strengthens the argument that petroleum couldn't have formed from organisms because it would take too long.
  D: This is irrelevant to the argument about the origin of petroleum.
  E: This weakens the argument that petroleum couldn't have formed from organisms because it suggests that some carbon deposits were indeed formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust, and this is supported by the presence of biomarkers.
  A: This weakens the geologist's argument that petroleum is formed from living organisms, but it does not refute the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  B: This statement is true, but it is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement supports the geologist's argument that it takes a long time for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This statement weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting an alternative source for carbon deposits that could form petroleum.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum refutes the theory that it formed from deep carbon deposits. 
  A: This fact does not necessarily weaken the geologist's argument, as there could be other explanations for the lack of biomarkers in some fossils.
  B: This fact is not relevant to the argument about the origin of petroleum. 
  C: This fact supports the geologist's argument, as it suggests that it would take a long time for petroleum to form from living organisms. 
  D: This fact is not relevant to the argument about the origin of petroleum.
  E: This fact weakens the geologist's argument, as it suggests that some carbon deposits did indeed form from the fossilized remains of plants, supporting the dominant view of petroleum formation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust.
  Some scientists challenge this view and hold that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist's argument is refuted by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  
A: This weakens the geologist's argument, but it does not address the challenge by the scientists who hold that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits.
B: This statement is true, but it does not address the argument.
C: This statement supports the geologist's argument that it would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
D: This statement is interesting but it does not address the argument.
E: This statement supports the view of the scientists who challenge the geologist's argument.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The geologist argues that petroleum is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals, as evidenced by the presence of biomarkers.
A: This statement does not weaken the argument because the argument does not claim that all fossils contain biomarkers.
B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because the argument is not about when living organisms emerged.
C: This statement does not weaken the argument because the argument does not claim that the process of forming petroleum is rapid.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because the presence of bacteria does not necessarily mean that petroleum is not formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
E: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests an alternative source of carbon deposits that could be the source of petroleum.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The geologist argues that the theory of petroleum formation from deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
- To weaken the geologist's argument, we need to find an answer that challenges the connection between biomarkers and petroleum formation from living organisms.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
If living organisms emerged long after the earth's formation, then petroleum could not have formed from the remains of living organisms, regardless of the presence of biomarkers. This weakens the argument of the geologist, who assumes that petroleum necessarily comes from living organisms because of the presence of biomarkers. The other options do not challenge this assumption directly.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals. 
  A: This weakens the geologist's argument even further because it suggests that not all fossils are formed from living organisms that produce biomarkers.
  B: This statement, if true, does not refute or weaken the geologist's argument.
  C: This statement, if true, supports the alternative theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits, rather than from living material.
  D: This statement, if true, does not refute or weaken the geologist's argument.
  E: This statement, if true, supports the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The geologist argues that petroleum is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust and that this theory is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum. However, some scientists argue that petroleum is formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth, but this theory conflicts with the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
A: This choice does not weaken the geologist's argument, as the presence of fossils that lack biomarkers does not disprove the idea that petroleum is formed from the remains of living organisms.
B: This choice is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not address the formation of petroleum.
C: This choice does not weaken the geologist's argument, as the argument does not depend on a specific time frame for the formation of petroleum.
D: This choice does not weaken the geologist's argument, as it does not address the formation of petroleum.
E: If some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, this would support the geologist's argument and weaken the opposing theory that petroleum is formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the view that petroleum was formed from the fossilized remains of living organisms.
  A: This weakens the geologist's argument slightly, but it does not address the issue of the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  B: This statement is true, but it does not address the issue of the formation of petroleum.
  C: This statement supports the geologist's argument, as it suggests that it would take a long time for petroleum to form from non-living material.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about the formation of petroleum.
  E: This statement weakens the geologist's argument, as it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, not from non-living material.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist's argument is that the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: The presence of fossils that are devoid of biomarkers would support the idea that petroleum does not necessarily have to contain biomarkers.
  B: The timing of the emergence of living organisms does not relate to whether petroleum is formed from living organisms.
  C: This statement supports the theory that petroleum is formed from living organisms as it would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: The existence of bacteria deep inside the earth's crust does not relate to whether petroleum is formed from living organisms.
  E: This statement supports the geologist's argument as it acknowledges the possibility that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants and not necessarily from living organisms.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: City leader: If our city adopts the new tourism plan, the amount of money that tourists spend here annually will increase by at least $2 billion, creating as many jobs as a new automobile manufacturing plant would. It would be reasonable for the city to spend the amount of money necessary to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant here, but adopting the tourism plan would cost less.
Question: The city leader's statements, if true, provide the most support for which one of the following
Choices:
  A: The city should implement the least expensive job creation measures available.
  B: In general, it is reasonable for the city to spend money to try to convince manufacturing companies to build plants in the city.
  C: The city cannot afford both to spend money to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant in the city and to adopt the new tourism plan.
  D: It would be reasonable for the city to adopt the new tourism plan.
  E: The only way the city can create jobs is by increasing tourism.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The city leader believes that adopting the new tourism plan would increase the amount of money spent by tourists and create jobs, and it would cost less than convincing an automobile manufacturer to build a plant in the city.
  
  A: The city leader did not make a statement about implementing the least expensive job creation measures available.
  B: The city leader only made a statement about the reasonableness of spending money to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant in comparison to the cost of adopting the new tourism plan, but did not provide a general statement.
  C: The city leader did not make a statement about whether the city can afford both measures or not.
  D: The city leader believes that it would be reasonable for the city to adopt the new tourism plan.
  E: The city leader did not make a statement that the only way the city can create jobs is by increasing tourism.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to this microorganism. However, this argument overlooks the possibility that some people who are exposed to staphylococcus may develop harmful symptoms, even if the majority do not. 
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true. 
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction do not try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors not washing their hands often means that handwashing is not effective in preventing disease, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. However, this is a flawed pattern of reasoning. The fact that people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. There may be other reasons why they do not develop harmful symptoms.
A: This argument is flawed because the fact that some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone does not necessarily mean that everything morally right is just.
B: This argument is flawed because the fact that advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true does not necessarily mean that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
C: This argument is flawed because the fact that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms does not necessarily mean that Isabel did not take the medication.
D: This argument is flawed because the recent decline in business expansions may be due to factors other than excessive taxation.
E: This argument is flawed because the fact that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals does not necessarily mean that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The student's argument is flawed because the fact that people are not getting sick from staphylococcus does not necessarily mean they have immunity to the microorganism. 
A: The argument pattern is not the same as the student's argument.
B: The argument pattern is not the same as the student's argument.
C: The argument pattern is not the same as the student's argument.
D: The argument pattern is not the same as the student's argument.
E: The argument pattern is similar to the student's argument because it jumps to a conclusion without sufficient evidence; just because doctors tend to wash their hands less often does not mean that washing hands is not effective in preventing disease.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The student is making an assumption that because many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This assumption may not be true because there may be other factors that contribute to why some people do not develop harmful symptoms.
  A: This is an argument that some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone, but the argument is not flawed in the same way as the student's argument.
  B: This argument is flawed, but in a different way than the student's argument.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, but this assumption may not be true.
  D: This argument is flawed in a similar way to the student's argument because it assumes a causal relationship between excessive taxation and the decline in business expansions without considering other factors that may contribute to the decline.
  E: This argument is flawed, but in a different way than the student's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is based on a faulty assumption that people who do not develop harmful symptoms after exposure to a microorganism have immunity to that microorganism.
  A: This argument is flawed because it confuses what is morally just with what serves the interests of everyone.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction are not trying to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that hand washing cannot be of value in preventing disease just because doctors tend to wash their hands less often than other healthcare professionals.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is based on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms implies an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This is not necessarily true since some people may be carriers of the microorganism but not show any symptoms, or they may have a strong immune system that fights off the infection effectively.
  A: This is an argument that some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone, but the conclusion does not follow from the premise.
  B: This is an argument that advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true, but the conclusion does not follow from the premise.
  C: This is an argument that Isabel did not take the medication because she is still quite ill, but the conclusion does not follow from the premise.
  D: This is an argument that high taxation leads to a decline in business expansions, but the conclusion does not follow from the premise.
  E: This is an argument that doctors wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals, but the conclusion does not follow from the premise.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The student's argument assumes that the exposure to staphylococcus without harmful symptoms is due to immunity, ignoring other possible reasons. 
A: This argument presents a flaw of equivocation, using different meanings of a term in different parts of the argument.
B: This argument presents a flaw of division, assuming that because one group shares a characteristic, all members of the group share that characteristic.
C: This argument presents a flaw of oversimplification, assuming that medication is the only thing that can affect a disease.
D: This argument presents a flaw of causal oversimplification, assuming that one cause is the only explanation for a complex phenomenon.
E: This argument presents a flaw of hasty generalization, assuming that a small sample is representative of a larger population.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The student assumes that everyone who is exposed to staphylococcus has immunity to it, which is not necessarily true.
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that everything that is morally right is just, but does not provide a sound reason why some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction do not try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors' behavior is representative of the effectiveness of hand-washing in preventing disease, which is not necessarily true.

Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The student's argument is that exposure to staphylococcus without developing symptoms means that a person has immunity to the microorganism, but this is not necessarily true. A person may not have developed symptoms due to other factors, such as a low number of bacteria or a strong immune system. 
  A: This argument is flawed because it equates moral rightness with actions that serve the interests of everyone, which may not always be the case.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication will always cure or alleviate symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that a decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.

Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  A: The argument is flawed because it commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent, which occurs when a conditional statement is taken to be reversible.
  B: The argument is flawed because it makes a sweeping generalization based on unrepresentative evidence.
  C: The argument is flawed because it commits the fallacy of equivocation, which occurs when a key term in an argument is used with two or more different meanings.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:

Response 9:
Knowledge: The journalist argues that the critique of the book's claims about the drug's side effects, made by a physician employed by the company that manufactures the drug, is not legitimate because the physician has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.

A: This choice is not relevant to the journalist's argument. The journalist's argument is only concerned with the critique of the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
B: This is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument. The argument assumes that the physician is completely unable to weigh evidence fairly because of their affiliation with the company that manufactures the drug. However, this assumption may not be true in all cases.
C: This is not a relevant criticism of the journalist's argument. The argument is focused on whether the critique of the book's claims is legitimate or not, and does not address the author's potential biases.
D: This is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument. The argument assumes that the critique is not legitimate because of the physician's personal biases. However, it is possible that the critique may still be legitimate, even if the physician has personal reasons to deny the claim.
E: This is not a relevant criticism of the journalist's argument. The argument is focused on whether the critique of the book's claims is legitimate or not, and does not address why the critique may not be legitimate.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control, despite doing similar amounts of typing.
  A: This statement does not explain the findings of the study, as the study only included office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  B: This may be a plausible explanation for the findings of the study, but it is not directly supported by the information in the passage.
  C: This statement may be true, but it does not explain the findings of the study, which focused on the relationship between control at work and carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the findings of the study, which focused on office workers who use keyboards regularly.
  E: This statement does not explain the findings of the study, as the study only focused on typing as the repetitive motion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that among office workers who do similar amounts of typing, those who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  A: This choice suggests that the workers who reported the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than those who reported the least control. This does not help to explain the study's findings.
  B: This choice suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This helps to explain the study's findings.
  C: This choice suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This does not help to explain the study's findings.
  D: This choice provides information about office workers who rarely use keyboards. This does not help to explain the study's findings.
  E: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This does not help to explain the study's findings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  The study focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
A: This answer choice suggests that there may be confounding variables that are affecting the results of the study. If office workers who have more control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing, then it may not be the lack of control that is causing the increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. Therefore, this answer choice does not explain the study's findings.
B: This answer choice provides a potential explanation for why a lack of control over one's own work could lead to an increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. If feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders, then this could explain why workers with less control over their own work have a higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. Therefore, this is a plausible answer choice.
C: This answer choice does not explain why workers with the least control over their own work have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. It only suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
D: This answer choice is not relevant to the study's findings because it focuses on office workers who rarely use keyboards.
E: This answer choice suggests that there may be confounding variables that are affecting the results of the study. If office workers who have more control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work, then it may not be the lack of control that is causing the increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. Therefore, this answer choice does not explain the study's findings.

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control, even though they did similar amounts of typing.
  
A: This answer choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. This does not help to explain the study's findings, as the study found that workers who did similar amounts of typing had different risks of developing carpal tunnel syndrome based on their level of control over their own work. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.
  
B: This answer choice suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This provides a possible explanation for the study's findings, as it suggests that workers who feel a lack of control over their own work might be more susceptible to nerve disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome due to the emotional stress that they experience. Therefore, this answer choice is correct.

C: This answer choice suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This does not help to explain the study's findings, as the study did not investigate the physical properties of keyboards. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.

D: This answer choice suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work. This does not help to explain the study's findings, as the study specifically investigated the relationship between typing and carpal tunnel syndrome. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.

E: This answer choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This does not help to explain the study's findings, as the study specifically investigated the relationship between typing and carpal tunnel syndrome. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.

  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  The study focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
Choices:
  A: This choice implies that the amount of typing is a factor that needs to be taken into consideration. However, it does not explain the relationship between control over work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  B: This choice suggests that the emotional stress caused by a lack of control over one's own work makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This is a plausible explanation for the study's findings.
  C: This choice suggests that the keyboards themselves are a source of the problem, rather than the workers' sense of control over their work. It does not explain the relationship between control over work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This choice is not helpful in explaining the study's findings because it is focused on office workers who rarely use keyboards.
  E: This choice suggests that the workers with the most control over their work perform other repetitive motions more often than those with the least control over their work. This does not explain the relationship between control over work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for Kodiak bears, and thus walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior.
  A: This criticism is not applicable because the argument does not generalize from the behavior of a few bears to all bears. It focuses on the natural behavior of Kodiak bears as a species.
  B: This criticism is a possibility, but it is not a direct attack on the argument's reasoning or evidence.
  C: This criticism is not applicable because the argument uses the term "behavior" consistently throughout the argument.
  D: This criticism is not applicable because the argument does not assume that all behavior can be explained in only two ways. It only argues that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not learned.
  E: This criticism is not applicable because the argument does not appeal to science as an authority. It presents evidence about the physical characteristics of Kodiak bears to support its conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:

  A: This is not an issue of generalization as the argument is not making a sweeping statement about all bears, but rather making a specific claim about Kodiak bears.
  B: This could be a potential criticism of the argument, but the argument is specifically claiming that walking on hind legs is completely natural behavior for Kodiak bears, so it is not vulnerable to this criticism.
  C: The meaning of "behavior" does not change during the course of the argument, so this is not a valid criticism.
  D: The argument is not presuming that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways, so this is not a valid criticism.
  E: The argument is not appealing to the authority of science in an inappropriate way, as it is using scientific evidence to support its claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is an instinctive behavior of Kodiak bears, not a learned behavior.
  A: This criticism is not applicable to the argument because the argument does not generalize from the behavior of a few bears, but rather makes a claim about the instinctive behavior of an entire species of bears.
  B: This is a possible criticism of the argument, but it is not the most vulnerable. The argument simply claims that walking on hind legs is a natural behavior of Kodiak bears, not that it is the only possible explanation for the behavior.
  C: This criticism is not applicable to the argument because the word "behavior" is used consistently throughout the argument.
  D: This criticism is not applicable to the argument because the argument does not make any claims about the nature of all behavior, but rather makes a claim about a specific behavior of a specific species of animal.
  E: This criticism is not applicable to the argument because the argument does not appeal to the authority of science in an inappropriate way.

  A: The survey does not provide information on the likelihood that physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies prescribe unnecessary drugs. This choice is out of scope.
  B: The survey does not indicate whether most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines. This choice is out of scope.
  C: This statement is consistent with the survey results. If some physicians believe that they are not influenced by drug companies' gifts while most other physicians are, then some of them must be mistaken about the degree of influence that such gifts have.
  D: The survey provides information on what physicians believe about the influence of gifts from drug companies on themselves and on other physicians. However, it does not provide information on the beliefs of physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts. This choice is out of scope.
  E: The survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts. This choice is too extreme and goes beyond the scope of the survey. It cannot be inferred from the survey that all physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage explains that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones wouldn't have allowed it to raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation. Instead, it could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, it must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  
A: The argument doesn't require this assumption. The passage does not mention modern ground-feeding animals and their neck structure.
  B: The argument doesn't require this assumption. The passage doesn't discuss Diplodocus's vision.
  C: The argument doesn't require this assumption. The passage doesn't discuss Diplodocus's brain or blood supply.
  D: The argument doesn't require this assumption. The passage explains that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  E: The argument requires this assumption. The passage explains that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it doesn't mention if it could also browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument is that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from browsing high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves, but it could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
A: The argument does not rely on the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals. Therefore, this is not an assumption required by the argument.
B: The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's ability to see in front of itself. Therefore, this is not an assumption required by the argument.
C: The argument does not discuss the supply of blood to an elevated brain. Therefore, this is not an assumption required by the argument.
D: The argument mentions that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, so it is possible that Diplodocus had other ways of accessing high-growing vegetation. Therefore, this is not an assumption required by the argument.
E: The argument suggests that Diplodocus may have fed on underwater vegetation, but it does not suggest that Diplodocus was unable to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them. Therefore, this is not an assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater because computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the dinosaur from raising its very long neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. However, the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, which allows Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.

A: Whether the same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals is irrelevant to the argument. 
B: How well Diplodocus could see in front of itself is not discussed in the argument.
C: The argument does not discuss the relationship between the neck structure and blood supply to the brain, so this assumption is not required by the argument.
D: The argument does not conclude that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, so this assumption is not required by the argument.
E: This assumption is not required by the argument because the argument concludes that Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument states that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the movement of raising its neck upwards to browse for high-growing vegetation, but it could bend downwards and extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: This statement is not required by the argument. The argument is about Diplodocus's neck structure and its feeding habits, not about other animals.
B: This statement is not required by the argument. The argument is about Diplodocus's neck structure and its feeding habits, not about its vision.
C: This statement is not required by the argument. The argument is about Diplodocus's neck structure and its feeding habits, not about blood supply to its brain.
D: This statement is not required by the argument. The argument already suggests that Diplodocus had another way of accessing vegetation by bending its neck downwards and extending it below ground level.
E: This statement is a possibility that contradicts the argument, but it is not required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the computer models showed that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but its neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing it to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument and not required as an assumption.
B: This statement is not mentioned in the argument and not required as an assumption.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument and not required as an assumption.
D: The argument suggests that Diplodocus had another way of accessing high-growing vegetation, by bending its neck downward and accessing underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, this statement is not required as an assumption.
E: The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land by bending its neck downward and even extending it below ground level. Therefore, this statement is not required as an assumption.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Diplodocus was not able to raise its neck high enough to browse for high-growing vegetation, but it could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument and does not affect its validity.
  B: This statement is not mentioned in the argument and does not affect its validity.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument and does not affect its validity.
  D: This statement contradicts the argument, which states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  E: This statement is a possible alternative to the argument, but it is not necessary to make the argument valid.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing the feeding habits of Diplodocus, a dinosaur.
  The computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the movement of raising its neck high to browse for vegetation.
  The neck could bend downward and extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument is discussing the feeding behavior of the dinosaur Diplodocus and how its neck structure would have affected its ability to browse for certain types of vegetation.

A: The argument does not require this assumption to be true or false. It is irrelevant to the argument.
B: The argument does not discuss Diplodocus's vision and therefore does not require this assumption to be true or false. It is irrelevant to the argument.
C: The argument does not discuss the blood supply to Diplodocus's brain and therefore does not require this assumption to be true or false. It is irrelevant to the argument.
D: This assumption is not required by the argument. The argument discusses how Diplodocus could have accessed vegetation, not whether it had other options for doing so.
E: This assumption is required by the argument. The argument states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not consider the possibility of Diplodocus browsing for such vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or walking into them.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument is about Diplodocus's feeding habits and how its neck structure would have prevented the dinosaur from browsing for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. The argument suggests that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

A: This statement is not relevant to the argument's conclusion about Diplodocus's feeding habits, so it is not an assumption required by the argument.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument's conclusion about Diplodocus's feeding habits, so it is not an assumption required by the argument.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument's conclusion about Diplodocus's feeding habits, so it is not an assumption required by the argument.
D: This statement is the opposite of what the argument suggests, which is that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, this statement cannot be an assumption required by the argument.
E: This statement is also the opposite of what the argument suggests, which is that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, this statement cannot be an assumption required by the argument.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its very long neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument is based on the personal experience of the author and their acquaintances, which is not a representative sample of the general population. Just because everyone the author knows voted a certain way does not mean the entire population voted the same way. Therefore, the conclusion that the official results must be rigged is not supported by the evidence presented. Choice A accurately describes this flaw in the reasoning.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument relies on anecdotal evidence from the people the speaker knows, which is not necessarily representative of the general population. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. This is a classic example of the fallacy of hasty generalization. 
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument is flawed because it assumes that the people the speaker knows are representative of the entire population, which is unlikely. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. This is an example of a sampling error, where the sample used to make an inference is not representative of the population as a whole. Therefore, choice A best describes the flaw in the reasoning of the argument. Choice B describes the circular reasoning, choice C describes an ad hominem fallacy, choice D describes a distinction without a difference, and choice E describes an appeal to popularity.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that the official results of the national referendum must be rigged because everyone the arguer knows voted against the proposal and this is clear evidence that most people voted against it.
  A: This is not a flaw in the argument.
  B: This is a flaw in the argument because it presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: This is not a flaw in the argument.
  D: This is a flaw in the argument, but it does not accurately describe the flaw in the argument.
  E: This is not a flaw in the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:  
The argument uses anecdotal evidence to support the claim that the election results must be rigged. Just because the people the speaker knows voted against the proposal, it does not mean that most people voted against it. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample (the people the speaker knows) that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. This reflects a flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that the official results of the national referendum must be rigged because everyone the arguer knows voted against the proposal.
  A: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
  B: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
  C: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
  D: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
  E: This choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses anecdotal evidence, which is evidence based on personal experience or observation, rather than a representative sample, to support the claim that the official results must be rigged. This sample is unlikely to be representative of the general population, and therefore cannot be used to draw conclusions about the population as a whole. The fact that everyone the person knows voted against the proposal is not necessarily indicative of how the general population voted. Therefore, the argument is flawed because the evidence presented does not support the conclusion drawn. Choice A accurately describes this flaw.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument presents a personal experience of the author, stating that everyone he or she knows voted against the proposal, as evidence that the official results of the referendum must be rigged. This is a classic example of anecdotal evidence, which is a type of evidence that relies on personal experience or isolated examples, and that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Therefore, option A, which describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument by pointing out that the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population, is the best answer. Option B is incorrect because the argument does not presume the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove. Option C is incorrect because the argument is not rejecting a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself. Option D is incorrect because the argument is not failing to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted. Option E is incorrect because the argument is not defending a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument suggests that the official results of the referendum must be rigged because everyone the person knows voted against the proposal, despite the fact that 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal.
  
A: This option describes a possible flaw in the reasoning of the argument, but it is not the best one.
B: This option describes a possible flaw in the reasoning of the argument, but it is not the best one.
C: This option describes a possible flaw in the reasoning of the argument, but it is not the best one.
D: This option describes a possible flaw in the reasoning of the argument, but it is not the best one.
E: This option does not accurately describe a flaw in the reasoning of the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses evidence drawn from a small, non-representative sample (the people the arguer knows) to conclude that the official results must be rigged. However, the sample of people that the arguer knows may not be representative of the general population, and thus cannot be used to discredit the official results. Therefore, the most accurate description of the flaw in the reasoning is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Option A is the best answer.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Inez: The book we are reading, The Nature of Matter, is mistitled. A title should summarize the content of the whole book, but nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy. Antonio: I do not think that the author erred; according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the conversation above?
Choices:
  A: Inez believes that the book should be called The Nature of Energy.
  B: Antonio believes that there are no differences between matter and energy.
  C: Inez and Antonio disagree on whether matter and energy are related.
  D: Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book.
  E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
Inez argues that nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing energy, so the title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Antonio disagrees with Inez's argument, suggesting that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Therefore, the most strongly supported option is E: "Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy."
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
Inez argues that the book's title should not only mention matter but also energy since nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing energy. Antonio, on the other hand, believes that matter and energy are closely related, and therefore thinks that the author did not err by titling the book The Nature of Matter. Thus, the conversation suggests that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez thinks that the book's title is not correct because it doesn't reflect the content of the whole book.
  Antonio thinks that matter and energy are the same thing.

Explanation:
  Inez and Antonio are discussing the title of the book and whether it accurately represents the content of the book. Inez thinks that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, because nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing energy. Antonio, on the other hand, thinks that matter and energy are the same thing. Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Hence, the answer is E.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez thinks that the book's title should summarize the content of the whole book, but nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy.
  Antonio thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning:
  Inez thinks that the title of the book, The Nature of Matter, is mistitled, because nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing energy. She thinks that the title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
  Antonio disagrees with Inez and thinks that the title of the book is appropriate because according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported option is E, which reflects Inez's opinion that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez believes that the book's title is mistitled, and nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing energy.
  Antonio believes that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
  
Reasoning:
  Inez's argument is that the book should have included energy in the title because nearly half of the book discusses energy, but the current title only mentions matter. 
  Antonio's argument is that matter and energy are closely related, and therefore, matter should be included in the title. 
  
  Therefore, the most accurate answer is E, which states that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
- Inez believes that the book's title is not appropriate because it does not summarize the whole content of the book. She also mentions that nearly half of the book is dedicated to discussing energy.
- Antonio believes that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon, which implies that they are related to each other.

Inez and Antonio agree on the relationship between matter and energy, but Inez thinks that the book's title should reflect that relationship. Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Hence, the correct answer is E.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez thinks that the book title is mistitled because almost half of the book discusses energy which is not mentioned in the title.
  Antonio thinks that the author did not err because matter and energy are closely related.

In the conversation, Inez and Antonio do not disagree on whether matter and energy are related. Inez's point is that since the book discusses energy so much, the title should reflect that. Antonio acknowledges that matter and energy are related, but he does not make any claims about the book title. Therefore, the best answer is E, which accurately summarizes Inez's opinion that the title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez argues that nearly half of the book discusses energy, and thus the title should reflect that.
  Antonio suggests that matter and energy are closely related.

Reasoning:
  Inez is not suggesting that the title should only be about energy, but rather that it should not only mention matter without also mentioning energy. 
  Antonio's statement supports the argument that the book's content warrants a title that encompasses both matter and energy.

Therefore, the best answer is E.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
- Inez thinks that the book's title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book.
- Inez thinks that the book has a significant portion on energy, which should be included in the title.
- Antonio thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning:
Inez argues that the title of the book is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book, which includes a significant portion on energy. Antonio disagrees with Inez, and he thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon, implying that the book's title is appropriate. Therefore, the most supported choice is E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. 

Answer("E")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
Inez believes that the book's title should summarize all the content in the book, including the discussion on energy, which is closely related to matter. Therefore, Inez thinks that the current title is mistitled. Antonio disagrees, saying that according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. However, Antonio's statement does not necessarily contradict Inez's argument about the book's title. Therefore, the most strongly supported option is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other. An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer, but the fact that Sandy has not rejected the offer does not necessarily mean that there is a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer, but if Gus made the offer in jest, the offer is not legitimate and the contract is not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business is legitimate, but the fact that the offer is legitimate does not mean that Mindy is obligated to accept it.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. If Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: Sal's offer was not legitimate, so there is no valid contract between Sal and Veronica.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The principle stated above mentions that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

A: The argument states that Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. The argument does not consider whether Sandy reasonably believed the offer to be made in jest or not.
B: The argument states that Gus made the offer in jest, which means that someone in Kenta's position would not have reasonably believed the offer to be a legitimate one. Thus, this argument helps to justify the reasoning that the contract was not valid.
C: The argument states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate, but it does not consider whether Mindy reasonably believed the offer to be made in jest or not.
D: The argument states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. This argument helps to justify the reasoning that the contract is valid.
E: The argument states that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. The argument does not consider whether Veronica reasonably believed the offer to be made in jest or not.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The principle stated above indicates that a contract is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

Action: Answer("B")
Reasoning: 
  Choice B discusses an offer that was made in jest, which would not be considered a legitimate offer. If someone in the position of the party to whom the offer was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest, then the offer would not be considered legitimate. Therefore, if Gus made the offer in jest, then the contract would not be valid. This reasoning is consistent with the principle stated above.
Response 3:
Knowledge: For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
A: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above. Joe made a legitimate offer to Sandy and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
B: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above. Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
C: This argument is incorrect because it is based on an assumption that may not be true. Just because Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business was legitimate, it does not mean that Mindy will accept the offer, even if she is a reasonable person.
D: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above. Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
E: This argument is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes that Sal's offer was not a legitimate one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  A: This argument is partially correct, but it does not address the issue of whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  B: This argument is correct. If Gus made the offer in jest and Kenta was unaware of this, then the offer is not legitimate and there is no valid contract.
  C: This argument does not address the issue of whether the offer was legitimate or not. Even if Frank's offer was legitimate, Mindy may still choose not to accept it.
  D: This argument is correct. If Hai's offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, then Lea can accept the offer and they will have a valid contract.
  E: This argument does not address the issue of whether the offer was legitimate or not. It simply states that the only offer Sal made was not legitimate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
A: The argument is valid because Joe made a legitimate offer, and Sandy has not rejected the offer, so there was a valid contract.
B: The argument is valid because Kenta accepted Gus's offer, but Gus made the offer in jest, so the contract was not valid.
C: The argument is invalid because the fact that Frank's offer was legitimate does not mean that Mindy has to accept it.
D: The argument is valid because Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
E: The argument is not valid because it is not clear whether the offer made by Sal was legitimate or not.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The principle stated in the context indicates that for a contract to be valid, an offer must be legitimate, and if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest, it is not legitimate.

A: This argument only states that Joe made a legitimate offer, but it does not address the issue of whether the offer was accepted or rejected legitimately. Therefore, this argument is not justified by the principle stated in the context.

B: This argument is justified by the principle stated in the context since it involves an illegitimate offer that was accepted by one party who was not aware of the real intention of the other party. Therefore, there was no valid contract.

C: This argument suggests that if Frank's offer is legitimate, Mindy should accept it. However, it does not address the issue of whether the offer was made in jest or not. Therefore, this argument is not justified by the principle stated in the context.

D: This argument is justified by the principle stated in the context since it involves a legitimate offer made in such a way that the other party could not reasonably believe it was made in jest. Therefore, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.

E: This argument only states that the offer made by Sal was not legitimate, but it does not explain why it was not legitimate. Therefore, this argument is not justified by the principle stated in the context.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: For a contract between two parties to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other. An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

C: This argument does not apply the principle stated above. The fact that Frank's offer was legitimate does not necessarily mean that Mindy will accept it.
D: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above. The offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would reasonably believe it to be made in jest, so there is a valid contract if Lea accepts the offer.
E: This argument does not apply the principle stated above. The fact that Sal's offer was not legitimate does not necessarily mean that there is no valid contract between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The principle stated above says that a contract is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

A: This argument talks about a legitimate offer being made and not being rejected. It does not consider if the offer was made in jest or not.
B: This argument talks about an offer being made in jest and hence the contract not being valid. This reasoning aligns with the principle stated above.
C: This argument talks about a legitimate offer being made and that Mindy, being a reasonable person, would accept the offer. It does not consider if the offer was made in jest or not.
D: This argument talks about an offer being made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest and hence the contract being valid. This reasoning aligns with the principle stated above.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.

  D: The passage does not support this statement. While stories about mad scientists may express a sense that scientific knowledge is incomplete or insufficient, the passage does not suggest that most such stories express antiscientific views.
  E: The passage suggests that some stories that employ symbolism may describe violations of the laws of nature, but it does not suggest that this is a necessary feature of symbolic stories.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two kinds of horror stories: those about mad scientists and those about monstrous beasts.
  Both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  Some horror stories about monstrous beasts use the monster as a symbol of the protagonist's psychological disturbance.
  Horror stories about mad scientists are often critical of the idea that scientific knowledge alone is sufficient to guide human endeavor.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes two kinds of horror stories, those about mad scientists and those about monstrous beasts.
  Both kinds of horror stories share two features:
    1. They describe violations of the laws of nature.
    2. They are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  The passage also states that, in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, and that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
Choices:
  A: The passage only states that descriptions of monstrous beasts in horror stories sometimes describe violations of the laws of nature, so this statement cannot be true.
  B: The passage only states that horror stories with violations of the laws of nature are intended to produce dread, but it does not say that all stories with such violations have that intention, so this statement cannot be true.
  C: The passage mentions that some horror stories about monstrous beasts use the monster as a symbol for a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, but it does not say that this is true for all horror stories of any kind, so this statement cannot be true.
  D: The passage states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, but it does not say that most stories express antiscientific views, so this statement cannot be true.
  E: The passage states that some horror stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature, which means that this statement could be true.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: When surveyed about which party they would like to see in the legislature, 40 percent of respondents said Conservative, 20 percent said Moderate, and 40 percent said Liberal. If the survey results are reliable, we can conclude that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses premises about the actual state of affairs to draw a conclusion about how matters should be.
  B: The argument draws a conclusion that merely restates a premise presented in favor of it.
  C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  D: The argument fails to consider that the survey results might have been influenced by the political biases of the researchers who conducted the survey.
  E: The argument uses evidence that supports only rough estimates to draw a precisely quantified conclusion.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, based on the comparison of a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging, and both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  A: This statement provides additional information about the injury rate of both groups, but it does not provide any information about the effectiveness of stretching before jogging in preventing injuries.
  B: This statement suggests that the effectiveness of stretching before jogging may be affected by previous injuries, which weakens the researcher's argument that stretching is not helpful in preventing injuries.
  C: This statement suggests that stretching may not be effective in preventing certain types of jogging injuries, but it does not provide any information about the effectiveness of stretching in preventing other types of jogging injuries.
  D: This statement suggests that the habit of performing stretches before jogging may be related to the jogger's susceptibility to injuries, but it does not provide any information about the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries.
  E: This statement provides evidence that contradicts the researcher's argument by showing that stretching before exercise can be effective in reducing the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, based on the comparison of a group of joggers who stretch before jogging and a group who don't stretch before jogging, both of which incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  A: This statement does not provide information relevant to the medical researcher's argument.
  B: If many joggers who were previously injured had difficulty performing stretches, this could suggest that stretching is not being done properly and may have contributed to the previous injuries.
  C: If most jogging injuries result from falls and collisions, then stretching before jogging may not have much of an effect on injury prevention, which would weaken the medical researcher's argument.
  D: This statement does not provide information relevant to the medical researcher's argument.
  E: This statement does not address the specific context of jogging and stretching before jogging.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. The argument is based on the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  A: This statement provides additional information about the rate of jogging injuries and does not necessarily weaken the researcher's argument.
  B: This statement suggests that some joggers may have difficulty performing stretches and may not stretch properly. This could weaken the researcher's argument that stretching does not help prevent injuries.
  C: This statement suggests that most jogging injuries result from events that stretching would have little effect on. This would weaken the researcher's argument that stretching does not help prevent injuries.
  D: This statement suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries develop the habit of stretching before jogging. This does not necessarily weaken the researcher's argument.
  E: This statement provides information about the effects of stretching on certain forms of exercise and is not directly relevant to the argument about jogging.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries because both groups of joggers, those who stretch and those who don't stretch, incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  
A: This statement does not weaken the argument, as it suggests that both groups incurred lower rates of injuries than the overall rate of injuries.
B: This statement does not weaken the argument because it suggests that some joggers might have difficulty performing stretches, but it does not provide evidence that stretching does prevent injuries.
C: This statement does not weaken the argument, as it suggests that stretching might not have an effect on the most common types of jogging injuries.
D: This statement could weaken the argument, as it suggests that stretching might be more common among joggers who are less prone to injuries. This could suggest that stretching might be preventing more injuries in the group that stretches.
E: This statement could weaken the argument, as it suggests that stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain exercises.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, based on the comparison of a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.

A: This choice provides additional information that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries for both groups of joggers. This indicates that both groups of joggers have lower injury rates than the average jogger, which could mean that stretching helps prevent injuries. Therefore, this choice would weaken the researcher's argument.
B: This choice introduces a new variable, stating that some joggers previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches. However, this choice does not provide information about whether stretching helps prevent injuries or not. Therefore, it does not weaken the researcher's argument.
C: This choice introduces a new variable, stating that most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect. However, this choice does not provide information about whether stretching helps prevent injuries or not. Therefore, it does not weaken the researcher's argument.
D: This choice provides additional information that the more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging. However, this choice does not provide information about whether stretching helps prevent injuries or not. Therefore, it does not weaken the researcher's argument.
E: This choice provides information that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise. However, this choice does not address the medical researcher's argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. Therefore, it does not weaken the researcher's argument.

  A: This statement provides additional information about the injury rate of the joggers, but it does not directly weaken the argument that stretching does not help prevent injuries.
  B: This statement suggests that some joggers may have difficulty performing stretches, but it does not directly address the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries.
  C: This statement suggests that stretching may not be effective in preventing certain types of jogging injuries, but it does not address the effectiveness of stretching in preventing other types of jogging injuries.
  D: This statement suggests that the habit of performing stretches may be related to a jogger's injury rate, but it does not address the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries.
  E: This statement directly contradicts the medical researcher's argument by suggesting that stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from exercise.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
- The researcher compared a group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging.
- Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.

A: This statement does not weaken the argument. In fact, it supports the idea that both groups of joggers were similar in terms of injury rates.
B: This statement suggests that the group that stretches may have had difficulty performing stretches, which may have affected their injury rates. This weakens the argument by suggesting a confounding variable that was not accounted for.
C: This statement suggests that stretching may not be effective in preventing certain types of injuries, but it does not address whether stretching helps to prevent the types of injuries that joggers are most likely to experience. Therefore, it does not weaken the argument.
D: This statement suggests that the group that stretches may be more prone to injuries, which would make it more difficult to detect a difference in injury rates between the two groups. This weakens the argument by suggesting a confounding variable that was not accounted for.
E: This statement suggests that stretching can be effective for certain types of exercise, which weakens the argument by suggesting that stretching may be effective for jogging.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries, based on a comparison between two groups of joggers.
- The argument implies that if stretching did help prevent injuries, the group that stretches would have incurred fewer injuries.
- The correct answer will provide evidence that suggests stretching does help prevent injuries or that the comparison between the two groups was not valid.

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation: 
- Choice E provides evidence that contradicts the medical researcher's conclusion. If stretching before exercise can reduce the severity of certain injuries, it suggests that stretching may indeed help prevent injuries.
- Choices A, B, C, and D are all irrelevant to the argument, as they do not address the issue of whether stretching helps prevent jogging injuries.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is an example of flawed reasoning. It uses the fact that most of the sociology majors are taking the class while most of the psychology majors are not, to conclude that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class. This conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.
  A: The flawed reasoning in this argument is similar to that in the original argument because it uses the fact that most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century, to conclude that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays. This conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.
  B: The flawed reasoning in this argument is different from that in the original argument because it uses the results of an opinion poll to conclude that most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks. This conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.
  C: The flawed reasoning in this argument is similar to that in the original argument because it uses the fact that most of the trees in the San Felipe city arboretum are of local rather than exotic species, to conclude that there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species in the San Felipe area. This conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.
  D: The flawed reasoning in this argument is different from that in the original argument because it uses the fact that most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not, to conclude that more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo. This conclusion follows logically from the premises.
  E: The flawed reasoning in this argument is different from that in the original argument because it uses the fact that the Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale, to conclude that Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale. This conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning, called the converse error. The converse error occurs when you reverse the order of the conditional statement and its conclusion. The argument assumes that if A implies B, then B implies A, which is not always true.
  
  A: The argument commits the converse error by assuming that if the Metro Art Museum displays mostly twentieth-century paintings, then it owns few if any of those paintings. This is not necessarily true.
  B: This argument is similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the stimulus. It commits the converse error by assuming that if more Silver Falls residents are in favor of increased spending on roads than on parks, then most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: This argument concludes that there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species in the San Felipe area, but it doesn't provide any evidence to support this claim.
  D: This argument concludes that more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo, but it doesn't provide any evidence to support this claim.
  E: This argument concludes that Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale, but it doesn't provide any evidence to support this claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument assumes that the number of students enrolled in Introduction to Social Psychology is directly proportional to the number of sociology and psychology majors at Morris University, which is not necessarily true. 
  A: The argument is flawed because it assumes that the museum cannot display paintings it does not own.
  B: The argument is flawed because it assumes that those who did not express an opinion are opposed to increased spending on parks.
  C: The argument is flawed because it assumes that the arboretum is representative of the species of trees in the San Felipe area.
  D: The argument is flawed because it assumes that Jumbo Supermarket and Valley Food Co-op are the only places to buy organic vegetables.
  E: The argument is flawed because it assumes that Acme Realty is offering only houses and condominiums for sale.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument assumes that enrollment in Introduction to Social Psychology is restricted to sociology and psychology majors only.
  The argument assumes that the number of students in each major is equal.
  A: The argument commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent, where the absence of evidence is used as evidence of absence.
  B: The argument commits the fallacy of false dichotomy or false dilemma, where only two options are presented as the only possible ones when there may be more.
  C: The argument commits the fallacy of composition, where the characteristics of the parts are attributed to the whole.
  D: The argument commits the fallacy of equivocation, where the term "most" is used in two different senses: one based on the number of vegetables, and the other based on the weight or volume of vegetables.
  E: The argument commits the fallacy of hasty generalization, where a conclusion is drawn from insufficient evidence.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presented in the question commits the fallacy of composition, which involves assuming that what is true of the parts must be true of the whole.
  A: This argument involves the fallacy of division, which involves assuming that what is true of the whole must be true of the parts.
  B: This argument involves a similar fallacy to the one in the question, as it assumes that what is true of the majority must be true of the whole.
  C: This argument involves the same fallacy as the one in the question, as it assumes that what is true of a part (the arboretum) must be true of the whole (the San Felipe area).
  D: This argument involves a similar fallacy to the one in the question, as it assumes that what is true of the majority must be true of the whole.
  E: This argument involves the fallacy of division, which involves assuming that what is true of the whole must be true of the parts.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument presented in the context is flawed because it uses the fact that more sociology majors are taking a class than psychology majors to conclude that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors in the class, which is an invalid assumption.
  A: The flawed pattern of reasoning in option A is that it assumes that the museum must own the paintings it displays, but it is possible that the museum borrows or rents some of the paintings it displays.
  B: The flawed pattern of reasoning in option B is that it assumes that those who did not express an opinion are opposed to both spending more on roads and on parks, but it is possible that they are indifferent or have a different opinion.
  C: The flawed pattern of reasoning in option C is that it assumes that the arboretum is representative of the entire San Felipe area, but it is possible that the arboretum is a selected sample.
  D: The flawed pattern of reasoning in option D is that it assumes that the availability of organic vegetables at two specific stores is representative of the availability of organic vegetables in the entire area, but it is possible that there are other stores that sell organic vegetables.
  E: The flawed pattern of reasoning in option E is that it assumes that Acme is offering an equal number of houses and condominiums for sale, but it is possible that Acme is offering a disproportionate number of houses or condominiums for sale.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The argument in the context is flawed since it concludes that there are more sociology majors than psychology majors registered for the course based on the fact that most sociology majors are taking the course while most psychology majors are not. This conclusion is based on an assumption and does not necessarily follow from the premise.

A: This flawed pattern of reasoning is different from the argument in the context, which concludes that there are more sociology majors than psychology majors based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the course while most psychology majors are not. In contrast, this argument concludes that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays based on the premise that most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century.

B: This flawed pattern of reasoning is similar to the argument in the context because it concludes that most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks based on the premise that more Silver Falls residents said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. However, this conclusion is based on an assumption and does not necessarily follow from the premise.

C: This flawed pattern of reasoning is similar to the argument in the context because it concludes that there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species in the San Felipe area based on the premise that most of the trees in the San Felipe city arboretum are of local rather than exotic species. However, this conclusion is based on an assumption and does not necessarily follow from the premise.

D: This flawed pattern of reasoning is different from the argument in the context, which concludes that there are more organic vegetables available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo based on the premise that most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not.

E: This flawed pattern of reasoning is similar to the argument in the context because it concludes that Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale based on the premise that the Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale. However, this conclusion is based on an assumption and does not necessarily follow from the premise.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument above states that most sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology while most psychology majors are not, then concludes that there are more sociology majors than psychology majors in the class. This conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.
  
A: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that there are no twentieth-century paintings in the museum's collection. This assumption is unsupported and the conclusion does not necessarily follow.
B: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that those who are not in favor of increased spending on parks are opposed to it. This assumption is unsupported and the conclusion does not necessarily follow.
C: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the arboretum is representative of the San Felipe area as a whole. This assumption is unsupported and the conclusion does not necessarily follow.
D: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the number of organic vegetables available at Valley Food and Jumbo are comparable. This assumption is unsupported and the conclusion does not necessarily follow.
E: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the number of houses and condominiums offered for sale by Acme is comparable. This assumption is unsupported and the conclusion does not necessarily follow.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The argument in the context uses the fact that most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, while most of the psychology majors are not, to conclude that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
A: The flawed pattern of reasoning in this option is different from the argument in the context, because there is no direct relationship between the paintings owned by the museum and the paintings it displays.
B: The flawed pattern of reasoning in this option is similar to that in the argument in the context because it uses the fact that more Silver Falls residents were in favor of increased spending on roads than on parks to conclude that most of the residents are in favor of spending more on roads.
C: The flawed pattern of reasoning in this option is similar to that in the argument in the context because it uses the fact that most of the trees in the San Felipe city arboretum are of local rather than exotic species to conclude that there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species in the San Felipe area.
D: The flawed pattern of reasoning in this option is different from the argument in the context, because it only compares the availability of organic vegetables between two stores, without making any conclusion about the total number of organic vegetables available in the area.
E: The flawed pattern of reasoning in this option is different from the argument in the context, because it only states that the Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses and fewer than half of the condominiums, without making any conclusion about the total number of houses and condominiums for sale by Acme Realty.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Whether or not one can rightfully call a person's faithfulness a virtue depends in part on the object of that personas faithfulness. Virtues are by definition praiseworthy, which is why no one considers resentment virtuous, even though it is in fact a kind of faithfulness-faithfulness to hatreds or animosities.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous.
  B: Virtuous behavior is praiseworthy by definition.
  C: Behavior that emerges from hatred or animosity cannot be called virtuous.
  D: Faithfulness and resentment are obviously different, despite some similarities.
  E: Resentment should not be considered a virtuous emotion.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The passage argues that faithfulness can be virtuous or not depending on what the person is faithful to. Then, it provides the example of resentment, which is not considered virtuous, despite being a kind of faithfulness. Therefore, the overall conclusion is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A accurately expresses this conclusion. Choice B is too broad, as it doesn't capture the idea that virtues depend on the object of the behavior. Choice C is too narrow, as it only applies to behavior emerging from hatred or animosity. Choice D is not a conclusion, but rather a statement. Choice E is also too narrow, as it only applies to resentment and not to faithfulness in general.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses faithfulness and how it can be a virtue depending on the object of that faithfulness. The conclusion drawn in the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Therefore, choice A most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument. Choices B, C, D, and E are all mentioned in the argument but are not the overall conclusion.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge:
- The argument talks about faithfulness and virtues.
- It says that virtues are praiseworthy and that resentment is not virtuous, even though it can be seen as a kind of faithfulness.
- This implies that the object of faithfulness determines whether it is virtuous or not.

Answering the question:
- The overall conclusion drawn in the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous.
- This is because the argument discusses how faithfulness to different objects can lead to different evaluations of the faithfulness (as virtuous or not virtuous).
- Therefore, the best answer is A.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses that the praiseworthiness of faithfulness depends on the object of that faithfulness, and that resentment is not virtuous despite also being a kind of faithfulness. The overall conclusion drawn in the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Therefore, the best answer is A. 

B is incorrect because while it is mentioned that virtuous behavior is praiseworthy by definition, it is not the main conclusion of the argument. 

C is too specific. The argument only discusses resentment being not virtuous. It does not make a broader claim about all behavior that emerges from hatred or animosity. 

D is incorrect because while the argument acknowledges that faithfulness and resentment are different, it is not the main conclusion of the argument. 

E is too specific because it only discusses resentment, whereas the argument is more broadly discussing the praiseworthiness of faithfulness.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses how the praiseworthiness of a person's faithfulness is tied to the object of that faithfulness. It then gives the example of resentment, which is a type of faithfulness to hatreds or animosities, and argues that resentment is not considered virtuous despite being a type of faithfulness. Therefore, the overall conclusion of the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A accurately expresses this conclusion. Choice B is too broad, as it does not account for the specific discussion of faithfulness. Choice C is a specific example rather than a general conclusion. Choice D is not a clear expression of the overall conclusion. Choice E is too narrow, as it only discusses resentment rather than faithfulness more broadly.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument is about how the object of a person's faithfulness determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. The author provides an example of how faithfulness to hatred is not virtuous. Therefore, the overall conclusion drawn in the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A accurately expresses this conclusion. Choice B is too general, as the argument is specifically about faithfulness. Choice C is also too narrow, as the argument is not about all behavior, but rather about faithfulness. Choice D is irrelevant to the argument. Choice E is too narrow, as the argument is not only about resentment, but rather about faithfulness in general.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
The argument is about faithfulness and whether or not it can be considered a virtue depending on the object of that faithfulness. The argument gives examples of faithfulness to virtues and to vices, and finally concludes that faithfulness to hatreds or animosities cannot be considered virtuous.

A: This is a true statement, but it does not capture the overall conclusion drawn in the argument.
B: This accurately describes the definition of virtuous behavior, but it is not the overall conclusion drawn in the argument.
C: This is the overall conclusion drawn in the argument. The argument gives examples of faithfulness to virtues and vices, and concludes that faithfulness to hatreds or animosities cannot be considered virtuous.
D: This is not the overall conclusion drawn in the argument. While the argument acknowledges that faithfulness and resentment are different, it does not focus on this difference as its main conclusion.
E: This is not the overall conclusion drawn in the argument. While the argument concludes that faithfulness to hatreds or animosities cannot be considered virtuous, it does not focus on resentment as an emotion. 

Therefore, the best answer is C.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses how the object of faithfulness affects whether or not it is considered a virtue, and how virtues are praiseworthy. The conclusion drawn from the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous, which is most accurately expressed in choice A. Choice B is too broad, as not all virtuous behavior is discussed in the argument. Choice C is too narrow, as it only discusses behavior stemming from hatred and animosity. Choice D is incorrect, as the argument does not focus on the differences between faithfulness and resentment. Choice E is also too narrow, as it only applies to resentment and not faithfulness in general.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness contributes to defining it as a virtue. The author provides examples of how faithfulness to hatred is not considered a virtue, despite it being a kind of faithfulness. Therefore, the most accurate conclusion that can be drawn from this argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A summarizes this conclusion best. 
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses how virtues are praiseworthy, and that a person's faithfulness may or may not be considered virtuous depending on the object of their faithfulness. The conclusion drawn is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Therefore, choice A is the most accurate expression of the overall conclusion drawn in the argument. Choice B is too general and does not capture the full idea presented in the argument. Choice C is only a specific example of the overall conclusion. Choice D is not a conclusion drawn in the argument, but rather a statement about the relationship between faithfulness and resentment. Choice E is too specific and does not capture the full idea presented in the argument.

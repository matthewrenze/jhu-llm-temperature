### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement describes a study that compares the preference of a group of volunteers for Sparkle Cola to the preference for five competing colas (one for each group of volunteers).
  A: This statement is correct and is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement. It acknowledges a potential limitation of the study design.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement, which focuses on the taste preference of the volunteers.
  C: This statement is correct and is a potential criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement. The study does not consider the possibility that another cola may elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This statement is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement, which is focused on the taste preference of the volunteers.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement, which is focused on the comparison of tastes between Sparkle Cola and its competitors.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  The study was conducted with blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of the competing colas.
  Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
A: The study was conducted with five smaller groups of volunteers, each tasting a different cola. The advertisement does not indicate that the generalization is true for the entire group of volunteers.
B: The advertisement does not take for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola over other colas. It only claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
C: The advertisement only claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than the competing colas that were tested. It does not make any claims about colas that were not tested.
D: The advertisement only claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than the competing colas that were tested. It does not make any claims about packaging or price.
E: The advertisement only discusses the response of consumers to different colas. It does not make any claims about other beverages.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted, based on a carefully controlled study with blindfolded volunteers divided into five groups. However, the advertisement does not provide information about the size of the sample or any details about the study design.
  A: This criticism is not relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement, as the advertisement does not make any generalization about the larger group of volunteers or each of the five smaller groups.
  B: This criticism is not relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement, as the advertisement does not make any assumptions about the buying behavior of the volunteers or the price of Sparkle Cola.
  C: This criticism is relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement, as the advertisement did not test all possible colas and there may be other colas that elicit a more favorable response from consumers than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This criticism is relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement, as the advertisement does not provide information about the factors that contributed to the volunteers' preference for Sparkle Cola over the competing cola, and there may be other reasons besides taste that explain their preference.
  E: This criticism is not relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement, as the advertisement is specifically focused on the comparison between Sparkle Cola and the competing colas tested.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The advertisement is presenting a study where blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, and most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. The advertisement concludes that this shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
A: This option suggests that the generalization made may not be true for each of the five smaller groups. The study was controlled, and each group tasted a different cola, so this option is a possible criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.
B: This option is a possible criticism of the claim made in the advertisement, but it is not based on the study presented.
C: This option suggests that there might be a cola that was not tested in the study that would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. While this is a possibility, it is not a criticism of the reasoning presented in the advertisement.
D: This option is a possible criticism of the claim made in the advertisement, but it is not based on the study presented.
E: This option is not relevant to the study presented in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement presents a study where blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups and each group tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. The advertisement then concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
A: This choice criticizes the generalization of the study that may not be true for each of the five smaller groups of volunteers.
B: This choice criticizes the assumption that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted. This is outside the scope of the study.
C: This choice criticizes the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. This is outside the scope of the study.
D: This choice criticizes the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste. This is a valid criticism of the study's conclusion.
E: This choice is outside the scope of the study.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement presents a study in which blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, and most of them preferred Sparkle Cola. The advertisement concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: This answer suggests that the study might have overlooked the differences between the five smaller groups of volunteers, but the study divides the volunteers evenly into five groups, so this criticism is not applicable.
  B: This answer suggests that the study's conclusions might not be valid outside the study's context, but the advertisement does not make this assumption.
  C: This answer suggests that the study might not have tested the optimal cola, but this criticism is not applicable because the study tested five competing colas.
  D: This answer suggests that the study's results might be due to factors other than the taste of Sparkle Cola, such as packaging or price, which weakens the advertisement's claim that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than any of the competing colas tested.
  E: This answer suggests that the study only tested colas, but this criticism is not applicable because the advertisement only claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than any of the competing colas tested.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the other competing colas tasted in the study. 
  A: This answer choice focuses on the possibility that the generalization made in the study may not be true of each of the five smaller groups, which is not the main issue with the study.
  B: This answer choice is talking about the cost of Sparkle Cola compared to other colas, which is not the main issue with the study.
  C: This answer choice focuses on the possibility of another untested cola eliciting a more favorable response, which is not the main issue with the study.
  D: This answer choice focuses on the possibility of people preferring Sparkle Cola for reasons other than taste, which is the main issue with the study.
  E: This answer choice is talking about the study not testing other types of beverages, which is not the main issue with the study.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The advertisement presents a study in which blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola as well as one of five competing colas. Most volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the other cola tasted. 
A: This choice is not relevant to criticize the reasoning in the argument.
B: The advertisement doesn't take for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
C: The advertisement doesn't overlook the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
D: This is a likely criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement because it overlooks other reasons, such as pricing and packaging, that might lead consumers to prefer Sparkle Cola over other colas.
E: This choice is not relevant to criticize the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement is claiming that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested, based on a carefully controlled study in which blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of the five competing colas, with most of the volunteers saying they preferred Sparkle Cola.
  A: This option criticizes the advertisement on the grounds that the generalization made about the entire group of volunteers might not be true of each of the smaller groups. However, the advertisement does not talk about making generalizations based on the smaller groups, but rather claims that Sparkle Cola is preferred to any of the competing colas tested. This option is not the best answer.
  B: This option criticizes the advertisement on the grounds that it takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola. However, the advertisement does not make any assumptions about whether the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola outside of the study. This option is not the best answer.
  C: This option criticizes the advertisement on the grounds that there might be a cola not tested in the study that would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. This is a valid criticism as the study only tested Sparkle Cola and a select few competing colas. This option is a possible answer.
  D: This option criticizes the advertisement on the grounds that many people might prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons other than taste. This is a valid criticism as there may be other factors that influence people's preferences not accounted for in the study. This option is a possible answer.
  E: This option criticizes the advertisement on the grounds that the study does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas. However, this criticism is not relevant to the claim made in the advertisement. This option is not the best answer.
  
Action: Answer("C or D")  
The two best answers are C and D, which both criticize the advertisement on the grounds that there may be other factors that influence people's preferences not accounted for in the study.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
The advertisement claims that a carefully controlled study was conducted where blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. The advertisement concludes that this shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
A: This option suggests that the advertisement did not consider that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups. However, the advertisement mentioned that each volunteer tasted a different cola, so this criticism is not valid.
B: This option suggests that the advertisement takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive. However, the advertisement did not mention anything about the likelihood of volunteers buying Sparkle Cola in the future, so this criticism is not valid.
C: This option suggests that the advertisement did not consider the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. This is a valid criticism because the study only tested five competing colas, so it is possible that there are other colas that could elicit a more favorable response.
D: This option suggests that the advertisement did not consider the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste. This is a valid criticism because the study did not control for factors such as packaging or price, so it is possible that these factors could have influenced the volunteers' preferences.
E: This option suggests that the advertisement is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas. However, this criticism is not valid because the advertisement only claims to compare Sparkle Cola to five other competing colas.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument above presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the "mistaken reversal." This pattern occurs when a conditional statement is reversed, leading to an incorrect conclusion.
A: This argument does not present a mistaken reversal. It presents a valid conditional statement and concludes that regular tire pressure checks will prevent premature tire wear.
B: This argument presents a mistaken reversal, similar to the argument in the question stem. It concludes that tire wear is caused by neglecting to check the pressure regularly, reversing the true cause and effect relationship.
C: This argument presents a different flawed pattern of reasoning known as the "false dilemma." It assumes that car owners are either aware or unaware of the consequences of neglecting to check tire pressure, without considering other possibilities.
D: This argument presents a mistaken reversal, similar to the argument in the question stem. It concludes that tire wear is caused by neglecting to check the pressure regularly, reversing the true cause and effect relationship.
E: This argument presents a different flawed pattern of reasoning known as the "irrelevant conclusion." It addresses a different cause of tire wear (gravel roads) and does not address the relationship between tire pressure and premature wear.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument uses conditional statements to make a conclusion.
  The conclusion is that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes the only factor that affects the attraction of birds in a bird feeder is the presence of a protective cover.
  A: The argument presents a conditional statement and makes a conclusion based on it, but it does not assume other factors are not involved.
  B: The argument presents a conditional statement and makes a conclusion based on it, but it does not assume other factors are not involved.
  C: The argument presents a causal statement and suggests a solution, but it does not assume other factors are not involved.
  D: The argument presents a causal statement and makes a conclusion based on it, but it does not assume other factors are not involved.
  E: The argument presents a causal statement and introduces another factor that affects the conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument above is an example of flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent, which occurs when someone assumes that a conditional statement's converse is true. For example, in the argument above, the author assumes that if a bird feeder has a protective cover, it will attract birds, which is not necessarily the case.
A: This argument does not involve the same kind of flawed reasoning as the argument above, so it is not the correct answer.
B: This argument is an example of the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above, in which the author assumes that if a car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly, then the tire will wear out prematurely. 
C: This argument is not an example of the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above, so it is not the correct answer.
D: This argument is an example of the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above, in which the author assumes that if a car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly, then the tire will wear out prematurely.
E: This argument is not an example of the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument above, so it is not the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a conditional statement in the form of a modus tollens: If A then B. Not B, therefore not A. 
  A: The argument in this choice presents a conditional statement in the form of a modus ponens: If A then B. A, therefore B. It does not match the flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument.  
  B: The argument in this choice presents a conditional statement in the form of a modus ponens: If A then B. A, therefore B. It does not match the flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument.
  C: The argument in this choice presents a conditional statement in the form of a hypothetical syllogism: If A then B. If B then C. Therefore, if A then C. It does not match the flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument.
  D: The argument in this choice presents a conditional statement in the form of a modus ponens: If A then B. A, therefore B. It does not match the flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument.
  E: The argument in this choice presents a conditional statement in the form of a disjunctive syllogism: Either A or B. Not A, therefore B. It does not match the flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  This question requires identifying the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument given in the context.
  The argument given in the context is a conditional statement.
  The argument also contains a causal claim, "squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover", which provides the reasoning behind the conditional statement.
  A: This argument is a valid conditional statement that provides a reason for why the tires might wear out prematurely. Therefore, it does not match the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument given in the context.
  B: This argument also provides a causal claim that explains why the tires might wear out prematurely. However, the causal claim is flawed because it assumes that neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly is the only reason why tire pressure might become too low. Therefore, this argument matches the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument given in the context.
  C: This argument is a non-conditional argument that provides a solution based on a premise. Therefore, it does not match the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument given in the context.
  D: This argument is a valid conditional statement that provides a reason for why the tires might wear out prematurely. Therefore, it does not match the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument given in the context.
  E: This argument is a valid conditional statement that provides an additional reason for why the tires might wear out prematurely. Therefore, it does not match the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument given in the context.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
The argument presents a conditional statement of the form "If P then Q" where P is "a bird feeder lacks a protective cover" and Q is "the bird feeder will attract squirrels and not many birds". The argument concludes that "If a bird feeder does not have a protective cover, then it will not attract many birds". This is a valid argument since it is a contrapositive of the conditional statement. 
A: This argument presents a valid inference from a conditional statement, so it is not similar to the flawed reasoning in the original argument.
B: This argument presents a valid inference from a conditional statement, so it is not similar to the flawed reasoning in the original argument.
C: This argument presents a valid inference from a conditional statement, so it is not similar to the flawed reasoning in the original argument.
D: This argument presents a valid inference from a conditional statement, so it is not similar to the flawed reasoning in the original argument.
E: This argument presents a conditional statement of the form "If P or Q then R" where P is "a tire's pressure is too low" and Q is "a tire is often driven on gravel roads", and R is "the tire will wear out prematurely". The argument concludes that "if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer". This conclusion does not follow from the conditional statement since it only addresses one of the two possible conditions (i.e., Q) and ignores the other (i.e., P).
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a conditional statement: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
  It then presents the second conditional statement: Squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The conclusion of the argument is: A bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that squirrels are the only cause for bird feeders not attracting birds. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above makes an assumption that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. 
  A: The argument above is a conditional statement that concludes that if a bird feeder does not have a protective cover, it will not attract many birds. This is similar to argument A, which concludes that if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: This argument concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. This is similar to the argument above because it concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  C: This argument concludes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure. This is not similar to the argument above because it does not rely on a conditional statement.
  D: This argument concludes that if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely. This is similar to the argument above because it concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  E: This argument concludes that keeping a tire's pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer if it is often driven on gravel roads. This is not similar to the argument above because it introduces a new factor that affects the outcome. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
The argument above presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as affirming the consequent. The argument goes as follows: 
  Premise 1: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
  Premise 2: Squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  Conclusion: So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
A: This argument presents a valid conditional reasoning pattern. It follows modus ponens. 
B: This argument presents a valid conditional reasoning pattern. It follows modus tollens.
C: This argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as assuming the conclusion. The argument is invalid because it presupposes what it is intended to prove.
D: This argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as affirming the consequent. The argument is invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
E: This argument presents a valid conditional reasoning pattern, but it is not similar to the argument above.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The argument presented in the context is an example of a flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent. This pattern of reasoning is invalid because there are other possible explanations for why the consequent occurred.
A: The argument in option A does not follow the flawed pattern of reasoning presented in the context.
B: The argument in option B follows the flawed pattern of reasoning presented in the context.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. 
  The argument provides evidence for this claim by noting that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not watch much television.
  We are looking for an option that weakens the reasoning above.
  
A: This answer choice provides evidence that many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them regardless of the amount of television they watch. This option does not weaken the argument, so it cannot be the answer.
B: This answer choice suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters. This does not provide any evidence that weakens the argument, so it cannot be the answer.
C: This answer choice suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. This does not provide any evidence to weaken the argument, so it cannot be the answer.
D: This answer choice suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This provides evidence that weakens the argument because it suggests that people who know more about natural disasters are not just relying on television to form their opinions about the likelihood of natural disasters.
E: This answer choice suggests that people who live in areas that are prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch an above-average amount of television than people who live in areas that are not prone to natural disasters. This might actually support the argument that watching too much television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters rather than weakening it. Therefore, this cannot be the answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.

A: This statement does not weaken the argument in any way because it says that many people regardless of watching TV overestimate the dangers.
B: This statement does not weaken the argument either. It talks about the likelihood of living in an area prone to natural disasters but does not address the issue of overestimating natural disaster risks due to watching TV.
C: This statement would weaken the argument as it states that people who watch a below-average amount of TV tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of natural disasters.
D: This statement also weakens the argument as it suggests that people who are well informed about natural disasters get their knowledge from another source and not from watching TV.
E: This statement does not address the argument made in the passage.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. The argument supports this claim by citing a recent study that found that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than those who do not.

A: This statement does not weaken the argument; it affirms the argument's claim that people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them.
B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument; it does not speak to the relationship between watching television and overestimating the risk of natural disasters.
C: This statement weakens the argument by providing evidence that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. This suggests that it is not television watching itself that leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters, but another factor that is associated with television watching.
D: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well-informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to become well-informed in some way other than by watching television. This suggests that it is not television watching itself that leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters, but another factor that is associated with not being well-informed.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument; it does not speak to the relationship between watching television and overestimating the risk of natural disasters.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risks of being victims of a natural disaster.
  A: This statement doesn't address the effect of watching television on overestimating the risks of a natural disaster.
  B: This statement seems to weaken the argument as it suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, hence they might not overestimate the risks of being victims of a natural disaster.
  C: This statement supports the argument as it suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: This statement, if true, weakens the argument by suggesting that people can become well-informed about the risks posed by natural disasters in some other way than watching television.
  E: This statement doesn't address the effect of watching television on overestimating the risks of a natural disaster.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument concludes that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risks of natural disasters compared to those who don't watch as much TV. The question asks us to find the option that weakens this reasoning.

Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: Option E suggests that people who live in areas that are prone to natural disasters may watch more television, and thus be more likely to overestimate the risks of natural disasters. This weakens the reasoning that watching more TV is the cause of overestimating the risk of natural disasters since it provides an alternative correlation.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead to overestimating the risks of the world.
  Option A does not address the link between television and overestimating natural disasters. It only states that many people overestimate dangers in general.
  Option B is not in line with the argument. It states that a person watching an above-average amount of television is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters.
  Option C casts doubt on the argument by stating that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have fairly accurate ideas about natural disaster risks.
  Option D suggests that people can become well-informed about natural disasters through means other than television.
  Option E is not in line with the argument. It only links television to living in an area prone to natural disasters.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument claims that watching an above-average amount of television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters. 
A: This statement does not weaken the argument since it does not address the assumption made in the argument.
B: If true, this statement provides evidence that contradicts the assumption made in the argument and weakens the argument. 
C: This statement supports the argument, which claims that watching too much television can lead to overestimating risks.
D: This statement suggests that people can become well-informed about the risks of natural disasters through means other than watching television. However, it does not address the assumption made in the argument and thus does not weaken the argument.
E: This statement provides a possible correlation between watching television and living in areas that are prone to natural disasters, but it does not address the assumption made in the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not. We need to find an option that weakens this argument.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: Option D weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This means that by watching television, one may not necessarily overestimate the risks posed by natural disasters. Option A is irrelevant as it simply makes a general statement about people overestimating dangers. Option B and E talk about the correlation between living in a disaster-prone area and watching television without providing any further explanation. Option C talks about people who watch a below-average amount of television, which is not relevant to the argument.
Response 8:
Knowledge: The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risk of being a victim of a natural disaster.
A: This statement does not address the argument made in the passage, it simply restates a known fact.
B: This statement weakens the argument as it suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are actually less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters.
C: This statement supports the argument made in the passage, as it suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
D: This statement weakens the argument as it suggests that people who are well-informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to become so by some means other than by watching television.
E: This statement does not address the argument made in the passage, it simply suggests a correlation between natural disasters and television watching habits.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The argument states that people who watch more than an average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risks of natural disasters than those who don't.
A: This statement doesn't weaken the argument because it doesn't address the impact of watching television on people's perception of risks.
B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it doesn't address the impact of watching television on people's perception of risks.
C: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that people who watch less television have a more accurate perception of risk than those who watch more television.
D: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well-informed about risks tend to get information from sources other than television, implying that television is not the only source of information for people to form opinions about natural disasters.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it doesn't address the impact of watching television on people's perception of risks.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
The biologist's argument suggests that the study should not be doubted just because of a small sample size. However, this argument is not strong. 
Knowledge:
  A: The argument does suggest that the behavior of chameleons is generalizable to lizards as a whole, but this is not the most vulnerable point.
  B: The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun, so this is not the most vulnerable point.
  C: The argument does focus on the author, but this is not the most vulnerable point.
  D: The argument does not address the relevant expertise of the study's critics, so this is not the most vulnerable point.
  E: The argument does suggest that the study's author should not be doubted because they have been doing excellent work for years, suggesting that the author is held to a higher standard than the study's critics.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's argument is that the critics of the study are wrong to doubt its results because the author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years. 
  The study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  A: The argument does not suggest that the behavior of chameleons is generalizable to all lizards.
  B: The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun. Rather, it states that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  C: The argument does focus on the author of the study as a way of addressing the critics' doubts about the results, but it also discusses the study's conclusions and the sample size. 
  D: The argument does not address whether or not the study's critics have relevant expertise. 
  E: The argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that a careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. The biologist also states that the critics of the study were wrong to doubt its results because the author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years. 

A: The biologist does not assume that all lizards behave like chameleons. The biologist only talks about the behavior of chameleons. So this is not a vulnerability in the argument. 
B: The biologist does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun. The biologist states that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. So this is not a vulnerability in the argument.
C: The biologist's argument does focus on the study's author, but the biologist supports the author's credibility by mentioning their professional reputation, not by attacking the critics. So this is not a vulnerability in the argument.
D: The biologist does not fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise. The biologist only mentions that the critics are wrong to doubt the results of the study. So this is not a vulnerability in the argument.
E: The biologist does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The biologist only mentions the author's professional reputation. So this is not a vulnerability in the argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument mentions that the study concludes that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their vitamin D production and that the study has a small sample size. The argument also mentions that the author of the study is well-regarded professionally.
  
A: The argument does suggest that the behavior of six individual chameleons can be generalized to lizards such as chameleons as a whole. However, this is not a likely ground for criticism, since many scientific studies are based on small samples and use them to make generalizations.
B: The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun. In fact, it specifically states that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
C: The argument does mention the author's professional qualifications, but this is not the main focus of the argument. Instead, it responds to a potential criticism of the study's results.
D: The argument does not make any claim about the expertise of the study's critics, so this is not a relevant ground for criticism.
E: The argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.

Action: Answer("C") The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The argument defends the study's results not by addressing the critics' specific objections but by appealing to the author's professional reputation and past work. This suggests a bias towards the author's credibility rather than the credibility of the study, which is a fallacy known as the "appeal to authority." The argument does not take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole, and it mentions the reason why chameleons bask in the sun. The argument does not fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise, nor does it focus its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The biologist concluded that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D based on a small study.
  Critics of the study doubt the conclusion due to the small sample size.
  The author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it holds the author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The argument appeals to the author's professional reputation and past performance to support the study's results, rather than addressing the valid criticism about the small sample size.
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument presented by the biologist suggests that the study's small sample size should not lead to doubts about the study's results. However, the argument does not provide evidence to support the claim that the sample size is not a significant issue or that the results of the study are generalizable to lizards beyond the six individual chameleons.

A: The argument does not address whether the behavior of chameleons is generalizable to lizards as a whole.
B: The argument mentions that chameleons regulate their production of vitamin D by basking in the sun, so it does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production.
C: The argument mentions the study's author, but it does not focus solely on the author. The argument also addresses the criticism of the study's sample size.
D: The argument does not discuss the expertise of the study's critics, so it cannot be criticized for failing to demonstrate that the critics have relevant expertise.
E: The argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself. Therefore, the answer is (C).
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's argument: a study showed that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D, and the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  A: The argument does not take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to all lizards, but rather concludes that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  B: The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun, but instead concludes that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate it.
  C: The argument does mention the study's author, but it does not focus exclusively on them. Instead, it also mentions the study's critics and their doubts.
  D: The argument does not fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise; it simply notes that they are wrong to doubt the study's results.
  E: This choice is the most accurate. The argument does hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. It suggests that the author's previous excellent work and professional reputation are sufficient reasons to accept the results of the current study, without addressing the specific criticisms of the study itself.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The biologist studied the behavior of six individual chameleons and concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  The sample size of the study was very small.
  Critics of the study doubted its results.
  The study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.

Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
The biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The argument relies on the authority of the study's author rather than on the merits of the study itself. Therefore, it is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it holds the study's author to a higher standard. None of the other choices are as strongly supported by the information provided.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that the increase in the subscription rates must be due to an increase in profits from publishing scholarly journals.
  A: This statement does not address the argument, nor does it weaken it.
  B: This statement is also not relevant to the argument, nor does it weaken it.
  C: This statement actually strengthens the argument by suggesting that the publishing of scholarly journals is expensive and therefore requires a profit to remain financially stable.
  D: This statement may weaken the argument by suggesting that the subscription rates have not increased for individuals, indicating that the increase in subscription rates is not due to profits but rather due to libraries' subscriptions.
  E: This statement does not address the argument, nor does it weaken it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument assumes that the increase in the average subscription rate is due to the increase in the profitability of publishing scholarly journals, despite the costs of publishing remaining fairly constant.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument since it only talks about increased costs to library users.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument since it only talks about a university library's acquisition budget representing a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: This statement actually supports the argument. It explains that publishing scholarly journals is expensive and publishers cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money, which means that the increase in subscription rates is likely due to profitability.
  D: This statement weakens the argument because it shows that the subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged for the past several years even though the average subscription rate paid by libraries has increased dramatically. This suggests that other factors, such as the negotiation power of libraries, may be driving the increase in subscription rates.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument. It only talks about the frequency of publication for scholarly journals.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that the subscription rate for scholarly journals has increased dramatically, while the cost of publishing a scholarly journal has remained constant; therefore, publishing a scholarly journal must be more profitable.
  A: This choice is related to library costs but does not directly address the argument.
  B: This choice is also related to library costs but does not address the argument.
  C: This choice supports the argument by stating that publishers cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: This choice weakens the argument by stating that subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged.
  E: This choice is related to publishing frequency but does not directly address the argument.

B: This statement is relevant, but it does not weaken the argument.
C: This statement supports the argument.
D: This statement weakens the argument because it states that subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged, which suggests that it is not more profitable to publish a scholarly journal now.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that because the average subscription rate a library pays for a scholarly journal has increased dramatically while the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant, publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument that the profitability of publishing scholarly journals has increased.
  B: This statement may weaken the argument by suggesting that the acquisition budget of a university library is not a significant portion of its operating budget. However, it does not directly counter the argument that the profitability of publishing scholarly journals has increased.
  C: This statement supports the idea that publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, which would counter the argument that publishing a scholarly journal is now more profitable than it was in the past.
  D: This statement suggests that the subscription rates for individuals have not increased, which would weaken the argument that publishing a scholarly journal is more profitable now than it was in the past.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument that the profitability of publishing scholarly journals has increased.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The psychologist argues that sedatives should never be prescribed for people with insomnia. 
  The psychologist claims that most cases of insomnia treated by psychologists are caused by psychological stress.
  The psychologist suggests that psychotherapy is a better treatment for insomnia caused by stress.
A: This answer choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning. However, it is not a flaw in the psychologist's argument that sedatives should never be prescribed for people with insomnia.
B: This answer choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning. The psychologist did not consider the possibility that sedatives could be the only known effective treatment for insomnia not caused by stress.
C: This answer choice also describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning. The psychologist did not consider the possibility that psychotherapy may not be effective for some people.
D: This answer choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning. The psychologist did not consider the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress.
E: This answer choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning. The psychologist presumes that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
The given context presents an argument made by a psychologist that insomnia should not be treated with sedatives, but rather with psychotherapy to alleviate stress. The question asks to identify the answer choice that does not describe a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning. 

A: The argument does not explicitly mention that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress, so this answer choice is not a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning. 
B: The argument does not address the possibility that sedatives are the only effective treatment for some cases of insomnia, so this answer choice is not a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
C: The argument does not consider the possibility that psychotherapy may not be an effective treatment for some individuals, so this answer choice is not a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
D: This answer choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning, as the argument assumes that sedatives are not helpful for insomniacs, but this may not be true in all cases.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at hospitals that implemented a plan to systematically record all staff errors. The argument also claims that the knowledge that errors were being monitored made the staff more meticulous in carrying out their duties.
A: This statement suggests that the hospitals were already taking steps to investigate life-threatening staff errors, but it does not provide information on the effectiveness of these steps. Therefore, this statement does not strengthen the argument.
B: This statement provides new evidence that the incidence of patient injuries has decreased, but it does not directly support the argument that the plan to record staff errors caused the decrease in injuries.
C: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
D: If this statement is true, it would support the argument's claim that the knowledge that errors were being monitored made the staff more meticulous in carrying out their duties.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument that the plan to record staff errors led to a decrease in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  A year ago several regional hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors resulting in patient injuries, which led to a decrease in the incidence of these injuries at these hospitals.
  A: The hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient before the plan was implemented.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: If the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries did not occur until staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, this suggests that the monitoring of staff errors was the reason for the decrease. Thus, this strengthens the argument that the plan to record staff errors was effective in reducing patient injuries.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to systematically record all staff errors has substantially decreased the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors since then. The reason for this is that knowledge of being closely monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the policy that was present before the implementation of the plan.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument as it talks about a different hospital that did not participate in the plan.
C: This statement weakens the argument as it suggests that the hospitals might have ignored or left out errors that can cause injuries to patients and only recorded the errors that did lead to injuries.
D: This statement strengthens the argument as it shows that the decrease in the incidence of injuries is linked with the knowledge of being closely monitored.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the staff members' punishment and not the plan's effectiveness in reducing patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  A: This option presents information about a policy that existed before the implementation of the plan, but it does not provide additional information that would strengthen the argument.
  B: This option presents information about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan, which is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This option presents information about errors that were not recorded, but it does not provide additional information that would strengthen the argument.
  D: This option provides a direct link between the recording of errors and the decrease in the incidence of injuries, which supports the argument that the hospitals became more meticulous because they were being monitored.
  E: This option presents information about the consequences of errors, but it does not provide additional information that would strengthen the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - A plan was implemented to record all staff errors resulting in patient injury at several regional hospitals.
  - The incidence of such injuries has decreased at these hospitals since the plan was implemented.
  - Knowledge of careful monitoring made the hospitals' staff more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  
A: Investigating life-threatening errors is not relevant to the argument about monitoring all errors.
B: The decrease at one hospital that did not participate does not prove that the plan was not effective at other hospitals.
C: This weakens the argument because it implies that the plan did not capture all errors.
D: This strengthens the argument by suggesting that the monitoring was the cause of the decrease in injuries.
E: The consequences of errors is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Several regional hospitals implemented a plan a year ago to record all staff errors that caused patient injuries.
  - The incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then.
  - The argument claims that the decrease is due to the knowledge that the errors were being recorded.

A: This policy existed before the implementation of the plan and is not related to the decrease in patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
B: This statement is about another hospital and does not strengthen the argument.
C: This statement weakens the argument by indicating that not all staff errors that could potentially cause injuries were recorded.
D: This statement strengthens the argument by linking the decrease in patient injuries to the awareness that the errors were being closely monitored.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument since it does not address the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that the incidence of injuries resulting from staff errors has significantly decreased since a plan to systematically record all such errors was implemented. The reason behind this decrease is that the staff members became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties when they knew that their errors were being carefully monitored.
  
  A: This statement talks about the hospitals' policy before implementing the plan. However, it does not provide any information about the effect of the policy on the incidence of patient injuries. Therefore, this statement does not strengthen the argument.
  B: This statement provides evidence that the incidence of patient injuries decreased at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan. However, it does not explain why the incidence of injuries decreased at this hospital. Therefore, this statement does not strengthen the argument.
  C: This statement talks about the errors that were not recorded under the plan. However, it does not provide any information about the effect of recording staff errors on the incidence of patient injuries. Therefore, this statement does not strengthen the argument.
  D: This statement provides evidence that the decrease in the incidence of injuries started when the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. This supports the argument by providing a reason why staff members became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties. Therefore, this statement strengthens the argument.
  E: This statement talks about the consequences of making errors under the plan. However, it does not provide any information about the effect of recording staff errors on the incidence of patient injuries. Therefore, this statement does not strengthen the argument.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since implementing a plan to systematically record staff errors. The hospitals' staff became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties because they were aware that their errors were being monitored.
  
  A: This answer choice does not strengthen the argument in any way. It is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the hospital's policy before the plan was implemented.
  
  B: This answer choice suggests that the incidence of patient injuries in a hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question, which could indicate an external factor or trend affecting all hospitals in the region. Therefore, it does not strengthen the argument that the implemented plan caused the decrease in injuries.
  
  C: This answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries. Therefore, it does not strengthen the argument.
  
  D: This answer choice strengthens the argument by providing evidence that the decrease in patient injuries started only after the staff became aware that their errors were being closely monitored. It suggests a causal relationship between the implementation of the plan and the decrease in patient injuries.
  
  E: This answer choice does not strengthen the argument. It is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the plan implemented to reduce them.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors helped reduce the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors at several regional hospitals.
  
A: This statement does not provide any information that can strengthen the argument being made.
  
B: This statement suggests that something other than the implementation of the plan may have caused the decrease in patient injuries at the regional hospital that did not participate in the plan, which weakens the argument made.
  
C: This statement suggests that the plan may not have been comprehensive as it did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries, which weakens the argument made.
  
D: This statement supports the argument being made by indicating that the decrease in patient injuries began after the staff became aware that their errors were being closely monitored and recorded.
  
E: This statement does not provide any information that can strengthen the argument being made.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors at several regional hospitals resulted in a substantial decrease in the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors. The reason for this decrease is claimed to be that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.

A: This statement indicates that the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient. However, it does not directly address the effect of the implementation of the new plan on the incidence of patient injuries. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.
B: This statement is about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan. It does not provide any evidence that the implementation of the new plan is not responsible for the decrease in patient injuries at the regional hospitals that participated in the plan. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.
C: This statement suggests a limitation of the new plan. If the plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not, it may underestimate the incidence of staff errors that could affect patient care. However, this statement does not strengthen the argument that the implementation of the new plan was responsible for the decrease in patient injuries. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.
D: This statement provides evidence that supports the claim that the implementation of the new plan was responsible for the decrease in patient injuries. If the decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, it suggests that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties. Therefore, this choice is the best answer.
E: This statement provides information about the consequences of staff errors that caused injuries to patients under the new plan. However, it does not provide any evidence that the implementation of the new plan was responsible for the decrease in patient injuries. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The CEO's argument implies that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, and that the corporation is doing all they can to pollute less. However, the CEO takes for granted that there are no production methods that do not produce any pollution. This assumption is flawed because it is not necessarily true that such methods do not exist or cannot be developed. Thus, the reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: The CEO's reasoning is flawed because he is generalizing too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. The CEO is justifying the corporation's actions by saying that they are not doing anything wrong because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did and there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. However, the fact that they have improved their methods does not mean that they are doing all they can to pollute less, and it does not necessarily mean that they are an environmentally responsible corporation. The CEO is using a specific example to justify a general statement, which is not a valid argument.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The CEO's argument is that their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did, and that there are no current methods that do not produce any pollution. 
  A: This is a possible flaw in the argument. The CEO assumes that there are no methods that do not produce pollution and does not consider the possibility that new methods can be developed.
  B: This is not a flaw addressed in the argument.
  C: This is not a flaw addressed in the argument.
  D: This is not a flaw addressed in the argument.
  E: This is not a flaw addressed in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

The CEO's argument is flawed because it assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, which is taking for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. Therefore, A is the best answer. The argument does not fail to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects, nor does it generalize too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. The argument does not take for granted that the company has succeeded in reducing the amount of pollution produced and it does not ignore the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The CEO argues that the corporation is environmentally responsible because it has improved its production methods to pollute less compared to its old methods. The CEO also claims that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
A: The CEO does not mention the possibility of production methods that do not produce pollution, so it cannot be taken for granted that they cannot be developed.
B: The CEO's argument does not involve different causes having similar effects, so this choice is irrelevant.
C: The CEO's argument is not making any hasty generalizations. Instead, the CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because it has improved its production methods to pollute less compared to its old methods.
D: The CEO's argument does not assume that the corporation has succeeded in reducing the amount of pollution produced. Instead, the CEO is arguing that the corporation has made improvements towards becoming more environmentally responsible.
E: This choice is valid since the CEO assumes that there are no methods that can produce less pollution than what the corporation currently produces. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because it pollutes less than it used to, and that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
A: This answer choice correctly identifies a flaw in the CEO's argument. The CEO assumes that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed, which is not necessarily true.
B: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument presented by the CEO.
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument presented by the CEO.
D: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument presented by the CEO.
E: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument presented by the CEO.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The CEO's argument assumes that there are no production methods that can be developed in the future that do not produce any pollution. This is a flawed reasoning, as it assumes that the current methods represent the best that can be achieved in terms of environmental responsibility. Therefore, choice A is the best answer. The other answer choices, although they may represent flaws in some arguments, are not applicable to the reasoning in this argument.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because they have reduced the amount of pollution produced, and that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. 
A: This answer is consistent with the CEO's claim that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
B: The CEO's argument is not considering different causes and their effects, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
C: The CEO's argument is not generalizing from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument. 
D: The CEO is assuming that the corporation has succeeded in reducing the amount of pollution produced. However, it is possible that the corporation has not actually reduced pollution as much as the CEO claims.
E: This statement is inconsistent with the CEO's argument that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The CEO tries to defend their corporation's actions as environmentally responsible by stating that their current production methods pollute less than their old methods, and that there are no methods that produce no pollution.

A: The CEO does not consider the possibility that production methods that do not produce pollution can be developed. However, it is not central to their argument, and hence is not the flaw in their reasoning.
B: The CEO's argument is not related to this choice. Hence, it is not the flaw in their reasoning.
C: The CEO's argument is an example of a hasty generalization, as they generalize from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. This is the flaw in their reasoning.
D: The CEO's argument is not related to this choice, and hence is not the flaw in their reasoning.
E: The CEO's argument is flawed in that they assume there are no methods that produce less pollution than their current methods. Hence, this is a possible flaw in their reasoning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed because it assumes that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed, which is an assumption that may not be true. Therefore, the CEO's argument is flawed as it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. Choice A correctly identifies this flaw.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile
  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered
  E: the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile
Response 0:
Knowledge:
Larew and Mendota disagree on what is a more accurate measure of change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest income quintile. 
A: Larew claims that the percentage change in average income is an accurate measure of economic prosperity while Mendota argues that the absolute amount of change in average income is a better measure.
B: Larew and Mendota do not express disagreement on whether change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile.
C: Larew and Mendota do not express disagreement on whether changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
Larew and Mendota disagree about whether the change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income. Larew argues that the lowest quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile, so their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. On the other hand, Mendota argues that the average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile. This means that even though the lowest quintile had a greater percentage increase, the highest quintile still received more in actual dollars, which is what matters more in measuring economic prosperity. Therefore, the disagreement is about how to accurately measure the change in economic prosperity.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Larew argues that the lowest income quintile had a higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did the highest quintile and their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile. 
  Mendota disagrees and argues that the percentage increase may have been higher for the lowest quintile, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile. Mendota does not say that there were no improvements in the economic situation of the lowest income quintile.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Larew believes that the lowest income quintile had a higher percentage increase in average income than the highest quintile, so their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's.
  Mendota disagrees and thinks that although the percentage increase might be higher for the lowest quintile, the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: Larew and Mendota are having a disagreement over the change in economic prosperity of the lowest vs. highest income quintile. Larew believes that the percentage change in average income of the lowest quintile was greater than that of the highest, while Mendota believes that the absolute amount of the increase in average income was greater for the highest quintile.

A: Larew and Mendota do not disagree on whether the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
B: This statement accurately describes the disagreement between Larew and Mendota, with Larew believing that the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile, while Mendota disagrees. Therefore, this is the correct answer.
C: Larew and Mendota do not disagree on whether changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
D: Mendota does not argue against the idea that there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
E: This statement accurately reflects Larew's position, but does not represent a disagreement between Larew and Mendota. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats, so that development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, so it should be allowed.
A: The argument by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the number of species endangered by the development of wetlands compared to other types of development.
B: The argument by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on this assumption, because the argument is that the replacement wetlands will offset any reduction of natural wetlands and prevent endangerment of the species that inhabit them. If this assumption were not true, then the argument would not be valid.
C: The argument by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not address the need to regulate wetland development in nations that are primarily agricultural.
D: This choice provides support for the argument by the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not an assumption on which the argument depends.
E: The argument by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the severity of the threat to the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands compared to other species. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development in Figoria must be regulated to protect wildlife, while the Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development is necessary for growth and should be allowed.
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption because it does not compare the effects of wetland development with other types of development.
B: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on this assumption because the replacement wetlands must be able to support the wildlife that inhabited the original wetlands in order for the development to cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption because it is only concerned with the regulation of wetland development in Figoria, not in nations that are primarily agricultural.
D: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on this assumption because it is based on the premise that the regulation of development has protected and preserved wildlife in the past and will continue to do so in the future.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption because it only concerns the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands, not their status in comparison to other designated endangered species.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that to protect wildlife, future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.
The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth. They also argue that they have as much right to govern their own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.

Analysis:
The question asks for an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends.
A: This statement is not related to the argument of Figorian Wildlife Commission.
B: This statement is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends because it assumes that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is about wetlands in industrialized nations, so this statement is not related.
D: This statement supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not an assumption on which their argument depends.
E: This statement is not related to the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission.

Action: Answer("B")

  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development in Figoria by requiring the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
  A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on whether wetland development endangers more species than any other type of development.
  B: If the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will not survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission would be weakened. Therefore, this assumption is required to support the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
  C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not address whether wetland development needs to be regulated in primarily agricultural nations.
  D: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is weakened if Figorian regulation of development has not always protected and preserved wildlife, but it does not depend on this assumption.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument is that there is not enough evidence to justify imposing a severe penalty on the auto repair shop for polluting the river.

A: This principle states that a more severe penalty requires greater certainty of guilt, which supports the argument's reasoning.
B: This principle is related to the severity of penalties, but it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
C: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction, but it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
D: This principle suggests that severe penalties may discourage people from admitting responsibility for their offenses, but it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
E: This principle supports the argument's reasoning that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that there is never sufficient certainty of guilt to justify punishment.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the pollution penalty is severe and requires stronger evidence to justify imposing the penalty.
  A: This principle is relevant to the argument, stating that stronger evidence is required before imposing a severe penalty.
  B: This principle is not relevant to the argument, as it discusses the severity of penalties without referencing the evidence required for imposing them.
  C: This principle is not relevant to the argument, as it discusses the proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused, rather than the evidence required for imposing the penalty.
  D: This principle is not relevant to the argument, as it discusses how unlikely it is for someone to admit responsibility for the offense, rather than the evidence required for imposing the penalty.
  E: This principle is the most relevant to the argument, stating that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be justified by the evidence.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether the local auto repair shop should be penalized for pollution. The penalty for this type of pollution is severe. But, the identity of the polluter is uncertain. So, the argument concludes that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  A: This principle states that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party. This principle supports the reasoning in the argument because the argument is based on the premise that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe and that we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty. 
  B: This principle is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This principle is not relevant to the argument because the argument is not about how to determine the severity of the penalty.
  D: This principle is not relevant to the argument because the argument is not about the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for the offense.
  E: This principle is similar to principle A. It states that the severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense. This principle supports the reasoning in the argument because the argument is based on the premise that we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty. This implies that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party. Therefore, principle A most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
This argument involves the issue of imposing a penalty for pollution without certainty of the identity of the polluter. Choice A states that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of guilt to impose it. This principle justifies the reasoning in the argument because it provides a moral or legal basis for the hesitation to impose the penalty without stronger evidence or confession. The other choices are either irrelevant to the argument or go against the reasoning. For example, Choice B is about the general principle of deterrence and is not directly relevant to the argument about identifying the polluter. Choice C is about proportional punishment and does not address the issue of uncertain guilt. Choice D is about the likelihood of confession and does not provide a moral or legal basis for imposing the penalty. Choice E is similar to Choice A but does not state the conditionality of certainty.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about a situation where the identity of the polluter cannot be established with sufficient certainty to justify imposing the penalty.
  A: This principle supports the argument's reasoning that the penalty cannot be justified without stronger evidence or admission of responsibility.
  B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This principle is relevant to determining an appropriate punishment but does not support the argument's reasoning about the uncertainty of the polluter's identity.
  D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This principle directly supports the argument's reasoning that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be justified without sufficient certainty of the polluter's identity.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty for an infraction without sufficient evidence to identify the guilty party. 
  A: This principle implies that one needs a certain level of certainty before imposing any penalty. This is consistent with the argument. 
  B: This principle is concerned with finding the right balance between severe and lenient penalties. It seems irrelevant to the argument, which is focused on the difficulty of imposing a penalty without sufficient evidence. 
  C: This principle is about the relationship between the severity of the penalty and the harm caused by the offense. While it is a valid principle, it is not directly relevant to the argument. 
  D: This principle suggests that severe penalties discourage people from admitting responsibility for an offense, which is not relevant to the argument. 
  E: This principle is consistent with the argument, which suggests that the penalty should be proportional to the level of certainty about guilt. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing the identity of the polluter and whether a penalty can be imposed without stronger evidence or admission of guilt.
  A: This principle is closely related to the argument, as it indicates that a stronger degree of certainty is required before imposing more severe penalties.
  B: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it is concerned with finding a balance between severity and effectiveness of penalties.
  C: This principle is related to the severity of penalties, but it does not directly address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  D: This principle is not directly related to the argument, as it is concerned with the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense.
  E: This principle is directly related to the argument, as it argues that the severity of a penalty should not exceed the degree of certainty of guilt.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
The argument is about imposing a penalty for pollution caused by an auto repair shop, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
A: This principle supports the argument that a severe penalty requires a higher degree of certainty about guilt. It is consistent with the reasoning in the argument.
B: This principle discusses the severity of penalties and their ability to deter crime. It is not directly related to the argument's reasoning.
C: This principle discusses the proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused by the infraction. It is not directly related to the argument's reasoning.
D: This principle discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense. It is not directly related to the argument's reasoning.
E: This principle discusses the severity of the penalty in relation to the certainty of guilt. It most directly supports the reasoning in the argument. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is that although it is probable that the auto repair shop is responsible for the pollution in the river, the severity of the penalty makes it necessary to have stronger evidence or a confession before imposing the penalty. The best principle that justifies this reasoning is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party. This principle recognizes that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the certainty of guilt.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  A columnist opposes a member of the legislature's proposal of redirecting the revenue from an additional charge on water bills, approved for building a dam, towards building new roads.
  A: This principle is relevant, but it does not help to justify the columnist's judgment of the legislator's proposal.
  B: This principle seems to support the columnist's judgment that the money should be used for projects that benefit the entire community, such as building a dam, rather than projects that benefit some members of the community, such as building new roads.
  C: This principle is not relevant because the proposal assumes that the additional charge on water bills will be used to fund the dam, which is an approved project. 
  D: This principle is not relevant because the additional charge on water bills has already been approved, and this principle does not address the legislator's proposal to redirect the revenue to another project.
  E: This principle is relevant because the proposed redirection of the revenue from the additional charge on water bills to fund a project unrelated to water-related expenditures would be inappropriate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The columnist believes that using the extra revenue to build new roads instead of the dam is not a good proposal.
  A: This principle is not directly related to the issue at hand.
  B: This principle does not directly apply to this specific issue, as the proposal does not involve diverting money from a community-wide project to an exclusive project.
  C: This principle is directly related to the issue at hand, as it suggests that the additional revenue should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: This principle does not directly apply to this specific issue, as the proposal has already been approved.
  E: This principle does not directly apply to this specific issue, as using the additional charge to fund new roads is still a potential water-related expenditure. 
Action: Answer("C")

  D: This principle is not relevant to the situation described, as the proposal has already been made and approved.
  E: This principle supports the idea that a water utility should collect an additional charge only for water-related expenditures.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The columnist thinks that using the money from water bills to build new roads is unacceptable.
  A: This principle is about customers knowing how their money is used, but it does not help justify the columnist's judgment.
  B: This principle states that money for projects benefiting the entire community should not be used for projects benefiting only some members of a community, but it is not directly related to the columnist's judgment.
  C: This principle implies that the project funded by the additional charge should not be something that the majority of the customers would disapprove of, but it is not clear that this is the case in the scenario.
  D: This principle is not related to the columnist's judgment because it pertains to the process of approving an additional charge, rather than how that money should be spent.
  E: This principle states that an additional charge should only be used for water-related expenditures, which supports the columnist's judgment that the proposed use of the money for road construction is unacceptable.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The advertisement claims that a survey conducted on a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders found that they reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
A: This answer choice is plausible since the advertisement only mentions that "most" people saved hundreds of dollars, but it does not address the possibility that some did not save as much. Therefore, it is the correct answer.
B: The advertisement does not provide any information about whether new policyholders pay less for their auto insurance than people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time. Therefore, it is not a correct answer.
C: The advertisement mentions that switching to Popelka could save "most" people hundreds of dollars, so it does not fail to address the possibility that switching to other insurance companies could save more money. Therefore, it is not a correct answer.
D: The advertisement does not provide any information about whether new policyholders underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Therefore, it is not a correct answer.
E: The advertisement does not provide any information about whether people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. Therefore, it is not a correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
The advertisement argues that new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders saved an average of $250 a year by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. The argument assumes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.

A: This is a potential weakness because the argument is based on a sample of policyholders and does not account for the possibility of some policyholders not saving any money.
B: This is not a relevant criticism because the argument is not comparing the rates of new policyholders and long-time policyholders.
C: This is a potential weakness, but the argument already acknowledges that switching to another company "would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money."
D: This is not a relevant criticism because the argument is not based on the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders' estimation of their savings.
E: This is a potential weakness because the argument assumes that this group is representative of all new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a survey of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. The argument is that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  A: This choice would weaken the argument, but it is not the most vulnerable to criticism. The argument is based on averages, so it is possible that some people saved little or no money, but that would not necessarily change the conclusion that most people could save hundreds of dollars.
  B: This choice is not relevant to the argument, because the argument is about people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies, not people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: This choice would strengthen the argument for other insurance companies that offer even greater savings, but it does not weaken the argument for Popelka.
  D: This choice is not relevant to the argument, because the argument is based on the self-reported savings of the survey participants.
  E: This choice is the most vulnerable to criticism, because it suggests that the survey may not be representative of the population of people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies. If the people who switch to Popelka are not representative of the larger population, then the conclusion that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka may not be valid.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement states that a sample of Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. The advertisement suggests that most people with auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
A: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument in the advertisement because it suggests that not all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders saved money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. However, this choice is not necessarily the best vulnerability of the argument.
B: This choice is not a vulnerability of the argument. The argument does not take for granted that new policyholders pay no less than existing ones. The advertisement does not provide any information about how much the new policyholders pay in premiums compared to existing ones.
C: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument in the advertisement because it suggests that switching to another insurance company could enable auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. However, this choice is not necessarily the best vulnerability of the argument.
D: This choice is not a vulnerability of the argument. The argument does not take for granted that few if any of the new policyholders underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
E: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument in the advertisement because it suggests that people who are capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka might be disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. However, this choice is not necessarily the best vulnerability of the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  
A: This choice points out that the advertisement fails to consider that some new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders may not have saved money by switching to Popelka. This does not necessarily challenge the validity of the survey's claim that most people could save money by switching to Popelka.
B: This choice does not challenge the argument in the advertisement.
C: This choice argues that switching to another insurance company may enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. This does not necessarily challenge the validity of the survey's claim that most people could save money by switching to Popelka.
D: This choice does not challenge the argument in the advertisement.
E: This choice argues that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka may be disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. This could mean that the sample is not representative of the general population and, therefore, the survey results are not generalizable to all auto insurance policyholders.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported saving an average of $250 a year by switching to Popelka.
  A: This choice presents a vulnerability to the argument if some of the new policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money after switching to Popelka. However, the advertisement states that the savings are "on average," which implies that some policyholders may have saved less or even more.
  B: This choice does not address a vulnerability to the argument. The advertisement does not compare the average cost of auto insurance for new policyholders versus long-term policyholders.
  C: This choice presents a vulnerability to the argument if switching to another insurance company would enable many policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. However, the advertisement does not compare the savings of switching to Popelka versus switching to another insurance company.
  D: This choice does not address a vulnerability to the argument. The advertisement does not address whether the policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved.
  E: This choice presents a vulnerability to the argument if people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. However, the advertisement does not provide any information that suggests this is the case.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
The advertisement claims that a sample of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders saved $250 a year, on average, by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. The argument suggests that most people with other auto insurance policies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.

A: The argument in the advertisement is not vulnerable to this criticism because it only claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. It does not claim that all new policyholders saved money or that they all saved the same amount of money. 

B: The argument in the advertisement is not vulnerable to this criticism because it does not compare the prices paid by new policyholders versus those paid by people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time. 

C: The argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to this criticism because it assumes that switching to Popelka is the best option for saving money, without considering the possibility that switching to another insurance company might enable auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would by switching to Popelka. 

D: The argument in the advertisement is not vulnerable to this criticism because it does not assume that few if any of the policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved by switching to Popelka. 

E: The argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to this criticism because it assumes that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are representative of all new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a survey suggests that new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders saved $250 on average by switching to Popelka.
  A: This choice suggests that the advertisement did not consider the possibility that some of the surveyed policyholders did not save any money or little money when they switched to Popelka. However, the advertisement did not mention that all of the policyholders surveyed saved money by switching to Popelka.
  B: This choice suggests that the advertisement assumes that the new policyholders pay the same price for insurance as the old policyholders. However, the advertisement does not make any claims regarding the price difference between the new and old policyholders.
  C: This choice suggests that the advertisement does not consider the possibility that other insurance companies might provide even more savings than Popelka. However, the advertisement does not claim that Popelka is the only insurance company that provides savings.
  D: This choice suggests that the advertisement assumes that none of the policyholders surveyed overestimated their savings by switching to Popelka. However, the advertisement does not make any claims regarding the accuracy of the survey.
  E: This choice suggests that the advertisement ignores the possibility that those who can save money by switching to Popelka are overrepresented among the new Popelka policyholders. However, the advertisement does not provide any information regarding the characteristics of the new Popelka policyholders.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a survey of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders showed that they saved $250 on average per year by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  A: This option presents a criticism about the possibility that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, but it does not specifically address the argument made in the advertisement.
  B: This option presents a criticism about the assumption that new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time, but it does not specifically address the argument made in the advertisement.
  C: This option presents a criticism about the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka, which is relevant to the argument made in the advertisement about switching to Popelka to save money.
  D: This option presents a criticism about the assumption that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, but it does not specifically address the argument made in the advertisement.
  E: This option presents a criticism about the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders, which is relevant to the argument made in the advertisement about switching to Popelka to save money.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, and suggests that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
A: The argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism on this ground, as it overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
B: The argument in the advertisement does not take for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time, and hence is not vulnerable to criticism on this ground.
C: The argument in the advertisement is not vulnerable to criticism on this ground, as it does not claim that switching to Popelka is the only way to save money on auto insurance.
D: The argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism on this ground, as it takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
E: The argument in the advertisement is not vulnerable to criticism on this ground, as it does not claim that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns.
  A second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  
A: This choice is irrelevant, as it does not support either group of doctors regarding the concern of bilirubin entering the brain.
B: This choice supports the second group of doctors' position that high bilirubin levels are not necessarily harmful, since if the baby has a disease that weakens its natural defenses, bilirubin can enter the brain and cause tetanus.
C: This choice is irrelevant, as it does not support either group of doctors regarding the concern of bilirubin entering the brain.
D: This choice is irrelevant, as it does not support either group of doctors regarding the concern of bilirubin entering the brain.
E: This choice is irrelevant, as it does not support either group of doctors regarding the concern of bilirubin entering the brain.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  There are two groups of doctors, one group recommends treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, and the other group argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high.
  If bilirubin enters the brain, it might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns.
  The brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
A: The information about the treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns is not relevant to the position of the second group of doctors.
B: If some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, this supports the position of the second group of doctors that argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
C: The information about the occurrence of the pigment bilirubin in fluids involved in digestion in newborns is not relevant to the position of the two groups of doctors.
D: If bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth, this information is not relevant to the position of the two groups of doctors.
E: The information about the agreement among the doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin on what levels should be considered excessively high is not relevant to the position of the second group of doctors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Two groups of doctors are debating whether to treat newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborn.
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the debate between the two groups of doctors.
B: This statement supports the position of the second group of doctors by showing that the natural defenses of the brain can weaken in some newborns, potentially allowing bilirubin to enter the brain.
C: This statement is irrelevant to the debate between the two groups of doctors.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the debate between the two groups of doctors.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the debate between the two groups of doctors.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

  The study compared two groups of people: Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students).
  Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
  There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A.
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  
Analysis:
  The question asks for the option that is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn.
  Options A, B, D, and E are relevant to the study design, and their presence helps establish the conclusion.
  Option C, however, is not relevant to the study's conclusion because it does not relate to memory issues in college students or older adults. 
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The study had two groups, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), who were required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. Group A was better at remembering to make the call at the specified time than Group B. The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  
A: This information is helpful in establishing that the two groups are comparable in size, which is important for the study's validity.
B: This information is helpful in establishing that the same group of researchers was responsible for answering calls made by the two groups, which is important for the study's consistency.
C: This information is helpful in establishing that there were no persons in Group B who were near the age of Group A, which could confound the results.
D: This information is helpful in establishing that both groups had the same access to the telephone, which is important for the study's internal validity.
E: This information is helpful in establishing that both groups had the same amount of time to prepare for the task, which is important for the study's external validity.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The study observed that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) performed better in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B (composed of college students). There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
 
A: This statement is helpful because it establishes that both groups have the same number of people, which means that the difference in results cannot be due to a difference in the size of the groups.
B: This statement is helpful because it establishes that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which means that the difference in results cannot be due to a difference in the way the calls were received.
C: This statement is not very helpful because it provides information only about the age of the college students and not about any other factor that could affect their performance in making the calls.
D: This statement is helpful because it establishes that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which means that the difference in results cannot be due to a difference in the availability of telephones.
E: This statement is helpful because it establishes that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which means that the difference in results cannot be due to a difference in the amount of time they had to prepare.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The study showed that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) were better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than Group B (composed of college students).
  A: The number of people in each group is not relevant to the conclusion.
  B: The researchers answering the calls is not relevant to the conclusion.
  C: Age distribution among the college students is not relevant to the conclusion.
  D: Access to telephones is not relevant to the conclusion.
  E: Timing of instructions is relevant, as this could affect the ability to remember and make the call on time.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage describes a study comparing two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), in their ability to remember to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time. Group A performed better than Group B in this task with fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: The age of the college students (option C) is irrelevant to the conclusion drawn from the study, which is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages. The passage compares Group A (65-75 years old) to Group B (college students), so the age range of the students is not important in the conclusion. All of the other options (A, B, D, and E) are important factors to consider when interpreting the results of the study.
Response 5:

  B: This fact does not affect the conclusion of the study and is irrelevant to the memory performance of the two groups.
  C: This fact does not affect the conclusion of the study and is irrelevant to the memory performance of the two groups.
  D: This fact does not affect the conclusion of the study and is irrelevant to the memory performance of the two groups.
  E: This fact is helpful in establishing the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, since it eliminates potential differences in the amount of time the two groups had to prepare for the task.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The experiment conducted compared two groups, Group A and Group B, where Group A consists of persons aged sixty-five to seventy-five years old and Group B consists of college students. The study found that Group A had better memory at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
A: This statement is relevant because it establishes that there were an equal number of people in each group, which means that the study was conducted fairly.
B: This statement is relevant because it establishes that there was consistency in the way the calls were answered in both groups, which means that there was no bias in terms of recording the results.
C: This statement is also relevant because it establishes that there were no confounding variables such as age in Group B that may have affected the results.
D: This statement is relevant because it establishes that both groups had equal access to the resources needed to make the telephone call.

Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
Question: The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: widespread cynicism is beneficial to the wellbeing of society
  B: cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the am01mt of information one has about them
  C: the work of contemporary journalists reflects a cynicism that is not really genuine

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Resident: Data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in our town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Question: The reasoning in the resident's argument is flawed in that the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the town has a relatively small number of houses
  B: inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe
  C: structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage
  D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe
  E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The resident claims that at least 60% of the town's houses have some problem that threatens their integrity based on the presence of inadequate site drainage and structural defects.
  A: The size of the town is not relevant to the reasoning of the argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the reasoning of the argument. The argument already includes this information in the premises.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the reasoning of the argument. The argument does not compare the ease of fixing these two problems.
  D: This is a possible alternative explanation for the data, but it does not necessarily weaken the argument.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the reasoning of the argument. The argument does not account for any overlap between inadequate site drainage and structural defects.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The resident's argument indicates that 30 percent of houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
- The resident concludes that at least 60 percent of houses in the town have some kind of problem threatening their integrity.
- The argument could be flawed if there are other possibilities that the resident overlooks.
- Choice A is irrelevant because it is not clear how the number of houses in town affects the argument.
- Choice B is not a flaw in the argument but rather a premise that supports the resident's conclusion.
- Choice C also does not represent a flaw in the argument but rather a statement that may or may not be true.
- Choice D is a possible flaw in the argument because it suggests that the percentage of houses with problems could actually be less than 60 percent.
- Choice E does not represent a flaw in the argument but rather a clarification of the problem in some houses that the argument already acknowledges.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The resident's argument is that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity because 30 percent of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects.
- A: The size of the town is irrelevant to the argument.
- B: This statement supports, rather than weakens, the resident's argument.
- C: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument.
- D: This statement could weaken the resident's argument. 
- E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that 30 percent of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe, and concludes that at least 60 percent of the houses in the town have problems that threaten their integrity.
  
A: The argument is not flawed by the size of the town, so this is not the correct answer.
B: The argument does not overlook this possibility, since it specifically mentions that 30 percent of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
C: This answer is out of scope, since the argument does not compare the ease of fixing inadequate site drainage versus fixing structural defects. 
D: This is a possible alternative explanation that the argument overlooks; the argument assumes that all houses have either inadequate site drainage, structural defects, or both, but it is possible that some houses have neither of these problems.
E: This possibility is already included in the argument, since the argument does not assume that the two sets of houses with problems are mutually exclusive. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument states that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage, 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe, and therefore, at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem threatening their integrity.
A: The size of the town is irrelevant to the argument.
B: The argument does not overlook that inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe, as it specifically mentions it.
C: The argument does not address how easy or difficult it is to fix inadequate site drainage or structural defects.
D: This is a possibility, but the argument specifically states that "at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem," so it does not overlook the possibility that many houses have neither problem.
E: This is also a possibility, but it does not address the flaw in the resident's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The resident's argument is that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity, based on the fact that 30 percent of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The argument acknowledges that inadequate site drainage can be a problem, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
  C: The argument does not address the relative difficulty of fixing site drainage versus structural defects.
  D: This choice is relevant to the argument. If many houses in the town do not have problems with inadequate site drainage or structural defects, the argument that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have a problem is weakened.
  E: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument assumes that the 30% of the houses with inadequate site drainage are different from the 30% of the houses with structural defects. It is not clear if the two sets are mutually exclusive. 
  A: The number of houses in the town is not relevant in evaluating the argument.
  B: This choice is mentioned in the argument and supports it.
  C: This choice is not relevant in evaluating the argument.
  D: This choice would weaken the argument as it suggests that the actual percentage of houses with problems is less than 60%. 
  E: This choice is possible and would strengthen the argument. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The resident argues that a minimum of 60% of the houses in the town have problems that threaten their integrity because 30 percent of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  A: The size of the town does not affect the validity of the resident's argument.
  B: The argument assumes that inadequate site drainage and structural defects are two distinct and non-overlapping problems and that having one does not imply having the other.
  C: The argument does not compare the relative difficulty of fixing inadequate site drainage versus structural defects.
  D: The argument overlooks the possibility that some houses do not have any of the problems mentioned.
  E: The argument assumes that having a structural defect that could make a house unsafe is not the same as having inadequate site drainage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The resident's argument indicates that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe. The argument concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  A: The size of the town is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion that at least 60% of the town's houses are at risk.
  B: This choice doesn't identify a flaw in the argument.
  C: This choice is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion that at least 60% of the town's houses are at risk.
  D: This choice would undermine the argument's conclusion that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity. However, this possibility is not overlooked in the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.

Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist. It talks about praise or blame for actions caused by conditions beyond a person's control, which is not the main issue being discussed. 
B: This answer choice strengthens the argument made by the ethicist that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. 
C: This answer choice restates the premise of the argument and does not provide any additional support. 
D: This answer is partially relevant to the argument made by the ethicist, but it introduces the idea that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, which is not discussed in the argument. 
E: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist. It talks about how much we know about the events leading up to an action rather than how much we need to know to praise or blame someone for that action. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument is about when it is justified to praise or blame someone for an action. The author rejects Tolstoy's claim that having more information would make us not regard an action as freely performed.
A: This statement is related to praise or blame for actions beyond someone's control, but it does not provide support for the author's argument about when praise or blame is justified.
B: This statement is directly related to the author's argument about when it is justified to praise or blame someone for an action. It supports the idea that the amount of information we have about an act does not determine responsibility.
C: This statement is close to the author's idea, but it gets the cause and effect reversed. The author is arguing that we can praise or blame someone for an action because we regard it as freely performed, not the other way around.
D: This statement is related to the inclination to praise or blame, but it does not support the author's argument that we are only justified in praise or blame when the action is freely performed.
E: This statement is the opposite of the author's argument. The author is arguing that having more information does not make us regard the action as unfree.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The ethicist argues that we are justified in praising or blaming a person for their action only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action, and that Tolstoy's claim is rash and unsound.
  A: This answer choice suggests that people should not be held responsible for actions that were caused by factors beyond their control, but this is not directly relevant to the argument being made by the ethicist regarding the justification for praise or blame.
  B: This answer choice accurately summarizes the argument made by the ethicist, that the amount of information we possess about an act does not determine whether the person doing it is genuinely responsible for the act.
  C: This answer choice restates the position of the ethicist, but it does not clarify or support the argument being made.
  D: This answer choice suggests that a person's responsibility for an action is not a matter of degree, but this is not directly relevant to the argument being made by the ethicist regarding the justification for praise or blame.
  E: This answer choice only addresses our perception of an action's freedom and does not contribute to the argument being made by the ethicist.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument of the ethicist is that we are only justified in praising or blaming a person for an action after knowing the events that led to that action. The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.

A: This answer choice seems to agree with Tolstoy's claim and contradicts the conclusion of the ethicist's argument. Eliminate.

B: This answer choice is in agreement with the conclusion of the ethicist's argument that how much information others possess about that act does not determine whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible. Keep.

C: This answer choice seems to be too extreme and does not address the argument made by the ethicist. Eliminate.

D: This answer choice suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action does not depend on how much information is available. This does not support the conclusion of the argument. Eliminate.

E: This answer choice contradicts the conclusion drawn by the ethicist that we are justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only after knowing the events that led to that action. Eliminate.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action. The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  A: This statement might be true, but it is not relevant to the argument of the ethicist.
  B: This statement supports the argument made by the ethicist. It claims that whether someone is responsible for an act does not depend on how much information others have about the act.
  C: This statement is a restatement of the argument made by the ethicist, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The Ethicist argues that before we can praise or blame someone for their action, we need to know a lot of the events that led to that action.
  The Ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew everything about the events leading up to an action, we would no longer regard that action as freely performed.
  
A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument provided by the Ethicist.
B: This answer choice is in line with the argument of the Ethicist. It argues that the degree of responsibility one bears for their actions is not affected by how much information we have about that action.
C: This answer choice is a rephrased version of the argument made by the Ethicist. It supports the Ethicist's position but does not enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
D: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument made by the Ethicist.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The ethicist argues that we need to know a lot about the events that led to an action before we can praise or blame a person for that action, rejecting Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events leading up to an action would cause us to cease to regard that action as freely performed.
A: This choice is not relevant to the argument of the ethicist.
B: This choice aligns with the argument of the ethicist that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not determined by the amount of information others possess about that act.
C: This choice is too extreme as it states that we can ONLY be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action when we regard that action as freely performed, which is not the argument of the ethicist.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument of the ethicist since it addresses the variation of our inclination to blame or praise based on the amount of information available, but it does not address the conditions for justifying praise or blame.
E: This choice is the opposite of the argument of the ethicist. The ethicist argues that we need to have a lot of information about the events leading up to an action to be able to praise or blame a person, whereas this option implies that the less we know about the events that led to an action, the more we are likely to regard the action as freely performed. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame someone for their action if we know a lot about the events that led to the action. The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew everything about the events leading up to any action, we would never regard that action as freely performed. 
A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: This answer choice supports the ethicist's argument that the knowledge of the events leading up to an action does not determine whether the person doing it is genuinely responsible, enabling the conclusion to be properly drawn.

Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The ethicist argues against Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events leading to an action would lead us to cease to regard it as freely performed.
  
A: This answer choice is related to the concept of free will, but it does not directly support or weaken the ethicist's argument.
B: This answer choice supports the ethicist's argument by stating that the amount of information others possess about an act does not determine whether the person doing it is genuinely responsible.
C: This answer choice restates the ethicist's argument but does not provide any additional support or reasoning.
D: This answer choice provides a possible explanation for why we may be inclined to blame or praise a person differently depending on how much information is available, thus supporting the ethicist's argument.
E: This answer choice claims that our perception of an action as freely performed is dependent on the amount of information we have, which contradicts the ethicist's argument that our level of knowledge about the events leading to an action should not determine whether we praise or blame a person.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that praising or blaming a person for an action requires knowledge about the events leading up to the action.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist's argument is that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because a large study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviated most of insomnia's symptoms. The study was conducted on people aged 65-81.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument presented by the pharmacist.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of biased individuals.
  C: The argument does not use two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
  D: This is a possible flaw in the argument. The argument infers that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because ingesting melatonin alleviated most of insomnia's symptoms. However, this inference does not necessarily mean that the claims are correct. It could be possible that melatonin is not produced less as the pineal gland ages, but that ingesting melatonin helps alleviate insomnia's symptoms for other reasons.
  E: The argument does not rely on an unrepresentative sample.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because a study showed that melatonin alleviated symptoms of insomnia in older people.

D: The argument seems to be confusing an effect with a cause, as it concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers are correct based on an effect of taking melatonin (alleviating symptoms of insomnia).
E: It is not clear from the argument whether the sample used in the study is representative or not.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that melatonin is effective in treating insomnia symptoms in older individuals.
  The argument supports melatonin supplements' claims of reduced production of melatonin in older people.

A: This choice is not relevant to the argument presented.
B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of biased individuals.
C: The argument does not use two different meanings for the same term.
D: The pharmacist is confusing an effect of taking melatonin with the cause of the decrease in melatonin production in the pineal gland.
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument presented.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist's argument is about the effectiveness of melatonin in alleviating insomnia symptoms in older people.
  A: This answer choice refers to an argument that infers causation from correlation. The pharmacist's argument does not rely on this type of flaw.
  B: This answer choice refers to an argument that relies on biased sources. The pharmacist's argument does not rely on this type of flaw.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
   The physician conducted an experiment where 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. The physician concluded that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  A: This choice suggests that the patients could have improved simply because they knew they were receiving treatment, and not because the treatment (magnetic fields) was effective. However, this does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  B: This statement presents an opinion about medication being more effective at relieving chronic back pain, but it does not provide any evidence that counters the physician's argument about magnetic fields relieving some back pain.
  C: This choice attempts to show that the experiment's results may not be applicable to other areas of the body, but it does not counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  D: This choice may suggest a bias in the scientists who designed the experiment, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  E: This choice presents a reasonable explanation for the variation in the effectiveness of magnetic fields, which does counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the group that received magnets reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This option is saying that improvement can happen just because of the patient's belief, and not actually due to the treatment. This weakens the physician's argument but it is not a strong counter.
  B: This option states an opinion of most physicians, but it does not provide any direct evidence against the physician's argument.
  C: This option is talking about the scope of the study, but it does not provide any evidence that contradicts the physician's argument.
  D: The fact that the scientists believed it would work before conducting the experiment does not necessarily mean the experiment's results are invalid. Therefore, this option does not provide a strong counter.
  E: This option suggests that there was a wide variation in the causes of back pain, which could be a confounding variable in the study and thus undermines the validity of the study's results. This provides the strongest counter to the physician's argument because it directly challenges the validity of the results.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment where 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in pain reported by the patients in the first group may have been due to the placebo effect rather than the magnets themselves. 
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument presented by the physician.
  C: This statement suggests that the results of the experiment may not be generalizable to other types of pain or other parts of the body. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument presented by the physician.
  E: This statement suggests that the improvement in pain reported by the patients in the first group may have been due to other factors related to the specific causes of their back pain rather than the magnets themselves.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment done on 50 patients with chronic back pain. 

A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the condition of patients who received magnetic treatment may not be due to the magnetic fields, but due to the placebo effect, i.e., the patient's faith in the treatment. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument.
B: This statement talks about medication and not about magnets. It does not directly counter the physician's argument.
C: This statement suggests that the findings of this particular experiment may not be generalized to other areas of the body. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument.
D: This statement suggests that the scientists who helped design the experiment had a bias towards magnetic fields. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument.
E: This statement suggests that the variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment might have affected the results. This provides an alternative explanation for the differences in improvement reported by the two groups and, therefore, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is based on an experiment in which 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. 
  A: This statement suggests that a placebo effect may have contributed to the results of the experiment.
  B: This statement presents an alternative treatment for chronic back pain, but it does not address the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  C: This statement suggests that the results of the experiment may not be generalizable to other areas of pain relief. 
  D: This statement implies that the experiment may have been biased in favor of the hypothesis that magnetic fields relieve back pain.
  E: This statement suggests that the variation in the causes of chronic back pain may have affected the results of the experiment.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment where 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement is about the placebo effect, which means that the belief that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in a patient's condition. It does not directly counter the physician's argument.
  B: This statement is about the effectiveness of medication compared to magnets in relieving chronic back pain, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnets.
  C: This statement is about other experiments showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in areas other than the back. It does not directly counter the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnets in relieving back pain.
  D: This statement is about the scientists who helped design the experiment and their beliefs about magnetic fields relieving back pain. It does not directly counter the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnets in relieving back pain.
  E: This statement provides an alternative explanation for the results of the experiment, suggesting that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could have affected the results and the physician's conclusion that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The physician has conducted an experiment with 50 patients that were divided into two groups to test the effectiveness of magnets in relieving back pain. The physician concludes that the magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
A: This choice presents a common phenomenon known as the placebo effect, where a patient's belief that a treatment will work can lead to improvement even if the treatment itself is ineffective. However, this does not necessarily negate the physician's argument.
B: This choice presents a belief held by most physicians but it doesn't necessarily negate the physician's argument, unless there is evidence to suggest that medication was offered to patients in this experiment, which is not mentioned in the context given.
C: This choice provides a limitation of the research, but it does not necessarily negate the physician's argument.
D: This choice presents a potential bias in the experiment design, but it does not necessarily negate the physician's argument.
E: This choice suggests that the cause of chronic back pain varies among individuals. This provides a plausible alternate explanation for the variation in results between the two groups. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement may not be due to magnets, but rather a placebo effect.
  B: Most physicians' beliefs do not necessarily negate the results of the experiment.
  C: This statement does not necessarily negate the results of the experiment.
  D: This statement does not necessarily negate the results of the experiment.
  E: This statement suggests that differences in the causes of the chronic back pain may have affected the results of the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The physician has an argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain, based on an experiment in which 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. One group received small magnets applied to their backs, and the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement provides an alternative explanation for the observed results and suggests that the reduction in pain may have been caused by a placebo effect rather than the magnetic fields.
  B: This statement is a belief held by most physicians and does not counter the physician's argument. 
  C: This statement does not counter the physician's argument because the focus of the argument is on magnetic fields' effects on back pain, not on its effects on other areas. 
  D: This statement does not counter the physician's argument because it is only about the scientists' beliefs and not about the experiment's results. 
  E: This statement is the most likely answer because it suggests that the observed results may have been due to the variability in the specific causes of the patients' chronic back pain, which could be a confounding variable. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain. The evidence cited is that most of the patients in the group where magnets were applied reported a significant reduction in pain, whereas very few patients in the group where no treatment was given reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This choice suggests that the improvement the patients in the first group experienced might have been due to a placebo effect, rather than the magnets themselves.
  B: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This choice suggests that the evidence for the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain is limited to one experiment, and this might weaken the argument.
  D: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This choice suggests that the improvement in pain might have been due to factors other than the magnets, such as differences in the underlying causes of the patients' pain.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument assumes that the viewers who reported that Lopez had better arguments may have been biased in favor of Lopez since Lopez eventually won the election.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not address whether the survey respondents who reported that Lopez had better arguments were biased or not.
  B: If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, this would undermine the argument by suggesting that the viewers who thought Lopez had better arguments were biased in favor of Lopez and not objectively evaluating the arguments made by both candidates.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not address the bias of the viewers who reported that Lopez had better arguments.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not address the bias of the viewers who reported that Lopez had better arguments.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument because it does not address the bias of the viewers who reported that Lopez had better arguments.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that the survey respondents who thought Lopez's arguments were better, may have been biased in favor of Lopez, since Lopez won the election.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not relate to the potential bias of the survey respondents who thought Lopez's arguments were better.
  B: This statement seriously undermines the argument because it suggests that there may have been a bias in the survey method. If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then the survey respondents who thought Lopez's arguments were better may not have been representative of the overall audience.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not relate to the potential bias of the survey respondents who thought Lopez's arguments were better.
  D: This statement also undermines the argument, but to a lesser extent than B. It suggests that the survey respondents who thought Lopez's arguments were better were not representative of the overall audience, as most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument, as it does not relate to the potential bias of the survey respondents who thought Lopez's arguments were better.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made better arguments.
  - The survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  - Lopez eventually won the election.
  
A: This answer choice does not have any direct impact on the argument.
B: This answer choice goes against the argument that Lopez had made better arguments because the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than Lopez. 
C: This answer choice does not have any direct impact on the argument.
D: This answer choice does not impact the argument because the survey was taken before the debate, not after it.
E: This answer choice also does not have any direct impact on the argument.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the viewers surveyed after the televised debate may have been biased in favor of the candidate they eventually voted for in the election.
  A: This fact, even if true, does not undermine the argument that the survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  B: This fact directly undermines the argument that viewers surveyed immediately after the televised debate thought that Lopez had made the better arguments because most of the live audience watching the debate thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: This fact does not undermine the argument that the survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez because it does not provide evidence of bias.
  D: This fact does not undermine the argument that the survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez because it does not provide evidence of bias.
  E: This fact, even if true, does not undermine the argument that survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez since he won the election.
  A: This choice does not affect the argument.
  B: This choice would undermine the argument since it suggests that the survey respondents who thought Tanner was more persuasive in the debate may have not been biased in favor of Lopez.
  C: This choice does not affect the argument.
  D: This choice does not affect the argument since the viewers who said they would vote for Tanner could still have thought that Lopez made better arguments during the debate.
  E: This choice does not affect the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  
A: This statement does not affect the argument because it talks about people who voted, not people who were surveyed after the debate.
  
B: This statement undermines the argument because it presents an alternative view to the survey respondents' opinions. If the majority of the live audience thought that Tanner was more persuasive, then the survey respondents who said Lopez was more persuasive may have indeed been biased in favor of Lopez.
  
C: This statement does not affect the argument because it relates to a different issue, which is the likelihood of voting for Tanner based on whether or not someone watched the debate.
  
D: This statement does not affect the argument because it relates to the viewers' opinions before the debate, not after the debate.
  
E: This statement does not affect the argument because it talks about the margin by which Lopez won, and not about the survey respondents' bias.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  A: This choice does not undermine the argument. Whether or not people who voted in the election watched the debate is not relevant to the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better.
  B: This choice undermines the argument. If the majority of the live audience watching the debate said that Tanner was more persuasive, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  C: This choice does not undermine the argument. Whether or not people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner is not relevant to the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better.
  D: This choice does not undermine the argument. The fact that most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner is not relevant to the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better.

  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually did win the election.
  A: This information is not relevant to the argument that the survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  B: This information contradicts the argument that the survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez. If most people in the live audience thought that Tanner was more persuasive, then the survey respondents who thought that Lopez was more persuasive cannot be said to be biased in favor of Lopez.
  C: This information is not relevant to the argument that the survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:

  The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  
  A: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
  B: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
  C: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
  D: The new program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. Therefore, if some employers in X issued separate paychecks for different categories of payments, the program would count them all as separate employees, leading to an overestimation of the total number of people employed in X. Thus, this choice is the correct answer.
  E: There is no information in the passage to support this conclusion.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The new program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the new program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The new computer program counted all paychecks as employment, so even if some workers received more than one paycheck per pay period, this would still be counted as additional employment. Therefore, the government would have overestimated the number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country in 1988.
  The program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  There was a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: Since some employers in X issued separate paychecks for different types of pay, the number of paychecks issued per pay period would not accurately reflect the number of people employed in X. Therefore, the use of the new computer program would overestimate the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in Country X.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in Country X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours, overtime, bonuses and commissions.
  
A: The passage does not provide any information about the accuracy of the government's estimate before or after the implementation of the new program. Therefore, this option is not valid.
B: The fact that some workers receive more than one paycheck per pay period does not necessarily mean that the designers of the program were unaware of this. Therefore, this option is not valid.
C: The passage does not provide any information about whether the government reported strong growth in the number of people employed in the quarters just before the new program was used. Therefore, this option is not valid.
D: Since some employers in Country X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions, the new computer program would overestimate the number of people employed. Therefore, this option is valid.
E: The passage states that there was a large increase in the number of people employed compared to the immediately preceding quarter. Therefore, this option is not valid.

  C: The passage does not provide information on whether the government had reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: Since some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses and commissions, the government may have double-counted some employees as employed in the first quarter for which the program was used. Therefore, the government may have overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

  E: There is no information to support this conclusion.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country in 1988.
- The new program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
- The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
- Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.

Analysis:
- The new program simply used the number of paychecks issued to estimate employment, which may not be accurate if some employees receive multiple paychecks per pay period.
- The fact that some employees receive multiple paychecks per pay period may suggest that the government's estimate of employment may be inaccurate.
- The increase in the number of people employed reported by the government may or may not be accurate given the above situation.
- There is no information that suggests that the people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.

Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the information provided, the best answer is D because the number of paychecks issued per pay period may overestimate the number of people employed, especially if some employees receive multiple paychecks. Therefore, the government may have overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 9:
Knowledge: The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country, and the program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X. Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
A: The passage provides no basis for determining whether the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before. The passage mentions no earlier method for estimating employment.
B: The passage provides no basis for determining whether the people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period. The passage gives no indication of the knowledge of the people who designed the new program.
C: The passage provides no basis for determining whether the government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used. The passage mentions no earlier method for estimating employment or the growth reported in previous periods.
D: The passage states that some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. The government's new program, however, simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers. Therefore, the government may have overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. So, this is the correct option.
E: The passage provides no basis for determining whether there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used. The passage only notes that the government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used, but the method used to estimate that increase may have been flawed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument suggests that Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of the hair dryer must be only half of what it was 5 years ago because the market share of the hair dryer has decreased from 50% to 25%, and the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed.

A: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the argument. The argument assumes that the decline in market share is due to a decline in total sales rather than increased competition. The argument doesn't consider that there could be more people using hair dryers now than there were five years ago, or that other companies may have increased their sales of hair dryers causing Wilson's market share to drop.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument as it does not provide any specific information that would alter the claim that Wilson’s net income from hair dryer sales must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
C: This choice is also not relevant to the argument, as it doesn’t address the reasoning behind the claim that the company’s net income from sales of hair dryers must be only half of what it was five years ago.
D: This choice is a possible consideration, but it doesn't necessarily weaken the argument. Changes in retail price may or may not have a significant effect on the company's net income from sales of the hair dryer.
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument as it is not necessary to know whether the hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products to assess the argument’s reasoning.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument suggests that Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of their hair dryer is only half of what it was 5 years ago because of a decline in market share and no change in the average net income per hair dryer sold.
A: The argument does not mistake the decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. The argument specifically states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Therefore, the decline in market share is the only reason for the decline in net income from sales of the hair dryer.
B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. The argument is discussing the decline in net income for Wilson Appliance specifically.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers. The argument is only concerned with the net income from sales of the hair dryer.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which could have offset the decline in market share and kept net income constant. 
E: The argument does not provide any evidence about whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% of all hair dryers sold nationwide in the last 5 years. The net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. The argument concludes that Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: This is the correct answer. The argument mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased in the last 5 years, and that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales have simply declined in relation to the total market. Without information about the total market size, the argument's conclusion cannot be valid.
  B: The argument is not concerned with the profits that hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them, so this choice is irrelevant.
  C: The argument is only concerned with sales figures for Wilson Appliance's hair dryers, so this choice is irrelevant.
  D: The argument assumes that the net income per hair dryer sold has remained constant, which implies that the price of the hair dryer has remained constant. If the price has increased, the argument's conclusion would be even more questionable.
  E: The argument does not suggest that the hair dryer is one of the least profitable products produced by Wilson Appliance, so this choice is irrelevant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer accounted for 50 percent of all sales five years ago but currently only makes up 25 percent of such sales. The argument also mentions that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.

A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product as it specifically mentions that the hair dryer accounted for 50 percent of all sales five years ago, and now it makes up only 25 percent of such sales.
B: The argument provides information about the net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold and does not require information about profits generated by other companies.
C: The argument only discusses sales figures for Wilson Appliance's hair dryers, and it does not provide information about the sales figures for other products of the company, nor is that information relevant to the argument.
D: The argument mentions that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, so the possibility of an increase in retail price is less likely to be overlooked.
E: The argument does not mention or discuss the profitability of any other products produced by Wilson Appliance Company.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago. However, currently, it accounts for only 25% of such sales. The average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Because of this decline, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: This statement is incorrect because the argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. The argument clearly states that the hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales five years ago and currently accounts for only 25% of such sales.
B: This statement is incorrect because the argument does provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them, i.e., the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
C: This statement is incorrect because the argument is only discussing the sales figures for Wilson Appliance's hair dryers and not its other products.
D: This statement is a possible flaw in the argument because it overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which would have affected the company's net income from sales of the product.
E: This statement is incorrect because the argument does not provide any evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.

A: Mistaking a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline for the total sales of that product is relevant because the argument assumes that there has been a decrease in the net income from sales of the product. However, it is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased over the past 5 years, but the market share of Wilson Appliance's product has decreased. This would result in an increase in the net income from sales of the product, contrary to what the argument suggests.
B: The argument does not require specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them.
C: The argument focuses only on the sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer and does not discuss sales figures for the company's other products.
D: Overlooking the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years is relevant because this would result in an increase in the net income from sales of the product, contrary to what the argument suggests.
E: The argument does not require independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents evidence that Wilson Appliance's product makes up a smaller percentage of sales than it did five years ago and that the net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. The conclusion drawn from this evidence is that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: This is the correct answer. The argument assumes that the decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has directly led to a decline in the company's net income from sales of the product, without considering the possibility that the total sales of hair dryers may have increased, or that Wilson Appliance's competitors may have lowered their retail prices.
  B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits of hair dryers, as it is only concerned with the net income generated by Wilson Appliance's product.
  C: The argument is only concerned with the sales figures of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer, and does not need to discuss the sales figures of the company's other products.
  D: The argument assumes that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has remained constant over the past 5 years.
  E: The argument does not discuss the profitability of Wilson Appliance's other products and only focuses on the hair dryer. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales five years ago and now it only accounts for 25% of such sales. 
  The argument also claims that the average net income Wilson Appliance Company receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument correctly states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales five years ago and now it only accounts for 25% of such sales. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
B: The argument provides specific information about the average net income that Wilson Appliance Company receives per hair dryer sold. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
C: The argument only discusses Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryers and does not mention other products. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
D: The argument assumes that the average net income Wilson Appliance Company receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, but it overlooks the possibility that the retail price of the hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which would result in higher net income per hair dryer sold. Therefore, this choice correctly identifies the flaw in the argument.
E: The argument does not provide any evidence about the profitability of Wilson Appliance Company's other products. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument states:
- Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer sales went from 50% to 25%.
- The average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed.
- Therefore, the company's net income from hair dryer sales is now half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. The argument clearly states that the market share has decreased, not the total sales.
B: The argument provides information about the income generated by hair dryers produced by Wilson Appliance, so this choice is incorrect.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for other products because it is solely focused on hair dryers produced by Wilson Appliance.
D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which could lead to the same net income despite the decrease in market share.
E: The argument does not provide any information on the relative profitability of Wilson Appliance's products. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has declined from 50% to 25%.
  The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The conclusion is that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It only talks about the declining market share of the product.
  B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them to make its conclusion.
  C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers to make its conclusion.
  D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years which could have impacted its net income, thus making it the correct answer.
  E: The argument does not state that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the iguanas on the small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: If genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, it could mean that the species on the island did not come from the Americas.

  A: This statement is irrelevant to the scientist's argument.
  B: This statement does not weaken the scientist's argument, but instead suggests that the iguana species on the islands have evolved in isolation from their relatives in the Americas.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the scientist's argument.
  D: This statement weakens the scientist's argument, as it suggests that the iguana species may have originated in Australia rather than the Americas.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the scientist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The scientist argues that the species of iguana found on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas since the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
A: The fact that a number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas is irrelevant to the scientist's argument because the scientist only talks about the iguana species.
B: The fact that genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas weakens the scientist's argument because it suggests that the species on the islands may have evolved separately from those in the Americas instead of rafting across the Pacific Ocean.
C: The fact that documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon is irrelevant to the scientist's argument because the argument is about the possibility of iguanas rafting on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean.
D: The fact that fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia weakens the scientist's argument because it suggests that the progenitors of the species on the islands may have come from Australia instead of the Americas.
E: The fact that the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana is irrelevant to the scientist's argument because it does not address the possibility of iguanas rafting on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean.

A: This statement is not directly relevant to the argument.
B: Genetic analysis indicating that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas would actually support the argument, rather than weaken it.
C: This statement suggests that the rafting hypothesis may not be common, but it does not directly contradict the possibility that iguanas rafted to the islands in question.
D: The existence of fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands in Australia would actually support the argument, rather than weaken it.
E: This statement is not directly relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the species of iguana on the islands near Australia came from the Americas via rafting across the Pacific Ocean. 
  A: The fact that some animals on the island are not found in the Americas does not weaken the argument regarding the iguanas.
  B: If the genetic analysis indicates that the iguanas on the islands have significant differences from those found in the Americas, it would suggest that the iguanas on the islands did not originate in the Americas.
  C: The uncommonness of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not invalidate the possibility that some iguanas could raft across the Pacific Ocean, and thus does not weaken the scientist's argument.
  D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those found on the islands have been found in Australia, it is possible that the iguanas on the islands could have come from Australia rather than the Americas, and thus weakens the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The editorialist claims that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, based on studies conducted 30 years ago.
  A: The argument may have inferred a general statement from a limited number of particular instances, but the flaw in the argument is not related to this.
  B: The argument does not consider the possibility of the latest technology improving safety, but rather argues that the latest technology did not improve safety in previous instances.
  C: The argument acknowledges that the council members support the increase, but still argues against it.
  D: This accurately describes the flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist assumes that because there is evidence against permitting air traffic in excess of an airport's original design capacity, the absence of evidence for the latest safety technology improving safety means that it wouldn't improve safety at all.
  E: This is not relevant to the argument made by the editorialist.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist's argument concludes that the proposed increase in air traffic at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety. The basis of the conclusion is that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity. 

A: This answer choice describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument but does not accurately represent the flaw. The argument does not draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in turn been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
B: This answer choice describes a possibility, but it is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
C: This answer choice describes a possibility, but it is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
D: This answer choice accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
E: This answer choice describes a possibility but is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, despite the purchase of the latest safety technology. The editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago to support this argument.
A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it does not accurately describe the flaw. The editorialist does draw a conclusion based on a limited number of instances, but this is not the main flaw in the argument.
B: This choice describes a possibility that could weaken the argument, but it is not the most accurate flaw in the argument.
C: This choice is not a flaw in the argument, as the argument does not address whether the city council members are aware of the studies.
D: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the argument. The argument assumes that a lack of evidence supporting the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic beyond its original design capacity is the same as evidence against this claim.
E: This choice is not a flaw in the argument, as the argument does not address whether the increase in safety risks might be acceptable for other benefits.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist claims that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, even with the latest safety technology.
  The council members are saying that the increase would not decrease safety due to the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist refers to numerous studies conducted 30 years ago that showed safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
  
Flaw:
  The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist claims that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, despite the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist refers to studies conducted 30 years ago that show a reduction in safety at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.
A: The argument does draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has been inferred from a limited number of particular instances (i.e., the studies conducted 30 years ago).
B: The argument does not consider the latest technology as a factor for the increase in air traffic.
C: The argument mentions the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago but it does not address how this affects the argument.
D: This accurately describes the flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument assumes that just because there is a lack of evidence against the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity, then there is evidence showing that it is unsafe to do so.
E: The argument does not consider the possibility of slight increase in safety risks for overriding benefits.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
The editorialist's argument relies on studies conducted 30 years ago to make a claim about the current situation. The flaw in the argument is that the editorialist confuses an absence of evidence against the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim. The editorialist assumes that because these studies were conducted 30 years ago and showed a decrease in safety, that this must still be true today, even with the latest safety technology. However, the fact that there is no current evidence against the claim doesn't mean that it is true. Therefore, the argument is weakened by this flaw.
Response 6:
Knowledge: The editorialist is arguing that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety based on studies conducted 30 years ago.
A: This does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
B: This is a possible flaw in the editorialist's argument. 
C: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
D: This does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
E: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument.

B: This choice presents an alternative possibility, but it does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
C: This choice presents an alternative possibility, but it does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim, since the studies conducted 30 years ago do not prove that the latest safety technology cannot permit airports to safely permit air traffic in excess of their original design capacity.
E: This choice presents an alternative possibility, but it does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety based on studies from 30 years ago.
  A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it does not accurately describe the flaw presented in the argument.
  B: This choice presents a counter-argument, but it does not accurately describe the flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  C: This choice presents a counter-argument, but it does not accurately describe the flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  D: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist confuses the absence of evidence that the latest safety technology would permit an airport to safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: This choice presents a counter-argument, but it does not accurately describe the flaw in the editorialist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The editorialist argues that an increase in air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity could decrease safety, based on numerous studies conducted 30 years ago.
  A: The argument does not draw a conclusion from a general statement inferred from a limited number of instances, but rather from studies conducted 30 years ago.
  B: The argument actually does consider the latest technology, saying that even when the airports made use of the latest safety technology, safety was still reduced.
  C: The argument does not address or consider whether the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument does not confuse the absence of evidence with the existence of evidence against the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic beyond its original design capacity. Rather, the argument claims that there is evidence that safety was reduced at every airport where this was done, even with the latest safety technology.
  E: The argument does not consider the possibility that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychiatrist: Take any visceral emotion you care to consider. There are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion. So, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Anger is always expressible.
  B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: Some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express.
  D: All emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: An emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument is structured as follows:
  Premise 1: Take any visceral emotion you care to consider.
  Premise 2: There are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion.
  Conclusion: So, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.

A: This statement is too extreme and not necessary to the argument. Even if anger were not always expressible, it does not necessarily mean there are no situations in which it is healthy to express anger.
B: This statement is necessary for the argument. The argument begins by stating that "any visceral emotion" can be expressed and goes on to conclude that "one's anger" can be expressed. Therefore, if anger is a visceral emotion, then the conclusion of the argument is logically sound.
C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. The argument is not concerned with whether it is healthy or unhealthy to express some kinds of emotions.
D: This statement is too extreme and not necessary to the argument. Even if we assume that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral, it does not necessarily follow that all visceral emotions are healthy to express.
E: This statement is too extreme and not necessary to the argument. The argument does not claim that an emotion is only visceral if it is healthy to express.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger. 
  A: The argument does not state that anger is always expressible.
  B: This statement is a premise of the argument, not an assumption required for the conclusion to follow logically.
  C: This statement is not required for the conclusion to follow logically. 
  D: The argument does not state that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: This statement contradicts the argument, which says that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion. Therefore, this statement cannot be assumed for the conclusion to follow logically. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that for any visceral emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion, and thus there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger. 
A: This answer choice is too extreme and absolute. If anger is not always expressible, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is never healthy to express anger, so it is not a necessary assumption for the argument's conclusion to follow.
B: This answer choice is correct. The argument assumes that anger is a visceral emotion and argues that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger. 
C: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion. The argument does not address whether some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express. 
D: This answer choice is too extreme and absolute. The argument talks about situations in which it is healthy to try to express an emotion, not all emotions that are healthy to express. 
E: This answer choice is too extreme to be assumed by the argument. The argument does not assume that an emotion is only visceral if it is healthy to express.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The psychiatrist argues that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion. The psychiatrist then concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  A: This is too extreme and not stated in the argument. The argument does not say that anger is always expressible.
  B: The argument states that anger is a visceral emotion, so this assumption is not necessary for the conclusion to follow.
  C: This is not necessary for the conclusion to follow because the argument does not say that some emotions should not be expressed.
  D: This is not necessary for the conclusion to follow because the argument only talks about visceral emotions.
  E: This is too extreme and not stated in the argument. The argument does not say that an emotion is only visceral if it is healthy to express.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion. The argument then concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  A: This is too extreme; the argument only states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, not necessarily that all emotions are always expressible.
  B: This statement is a premise of the argument, not an assumption.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the conclusion of the argument, which is about expressing anger.
  D: This statement is too extreme. The argument only claims that any healthy-to-express emotion is visceral, not necessarily that all visceral emotions are healthy to express.
  E: This statement is too extreme. The argument only claims that any healthy-to-express emotion is visceral, not necessarily that all visceral emotions are healthy to express.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that every visceral emotion has situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion, and therefore, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  A: The argument does not state that anger is always expressible.
  B: The argument states that anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: The argument does not state that some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express. It is focused on the fact that for every visceral emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion.
  D: The argument does not state that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: The argument does not state that an emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.
Action: Answer("B")

  C: This is irrelevant to the conclusion of the argument.
  D: This is too extreme and not necessary for the conclusion to follow.
  E: This is too extreme and not necessary for the conclusion to follow.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Conclusion: There are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  Psychiatrist argues that any visceral emotion can be healthy to express in some situations.
  A: The argument does not assume this, as there may be some situations where anger is not expressible.
  B: The argument uses this premise to support the main conclusion.
  C: This statement would weaken the argument as it argues that some emotions are unhealthy to express.
  D: The argument does not support this, as it is not clear that all healthy emotions are visceral.
  E: This statement is not supported by the argument, as there may be some visceral emotions that are not healthy to express.

Action: Answer("B")

E: The argument does not assume that an emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express or not.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that for any visceral emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion, and therefore, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  A: This statement is too strong. The argument only claims that there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion. We don't know if anger is always expressible.
  B: This statement is true and is part of the premise of the argument. The argument assumes that anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the conclusion of the argument. The argument is about situations in which it is healthy to express emotions, not about whether some emotions are unhealthy to express.
  D: This statement is too strong. The argument only claims that for any visceral emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion. We don't know if all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: This statement is too strong. The argument only claims that for any visceral emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion. We don't know if an emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The argument claims that more collisions occur on roads with specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads without such lanes.
- The argument concludes that adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
A: This criticism may weaken the argument, but it does not address the main point of the argument. The argument is about the likelihood of enhancing safety by adding bicycle lanes, not about the severity of injuries.
B: This criticism does not address the main point of the argument. The argument is about the likelihood of enhancing safety by adding bicycle lanes, not about the number of bicyclists who ride on different types of roads.
C: This criticism does not weaken the argument. The argument is not assuming that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
D: This criticism is somewhat similar to the argument made in the passage, but it is not an accurate description of the argument. The argument does not claim that only some roads with bicycle lanes are safe. Rather, it claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, regardless of which roads are selected for the addition of lanes.
E: This criticism accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The argument is based on statistical evidence, but the conclusion drawn from the evidence is not supported by the evidence.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists and supports this claim by providing statistics that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having bicycle lanes than on roads without bicycle lanes.
  
A: This criticism is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not address the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents.
  
B: This criticism is not relevant to the argument because the argument is based on a comparison of collision rates between roads with and without bicycle lanes.
  
C: This criticism is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not make any assumptions about the effect of road alterations on the safety of motorists.
  
D: This is a valid criticism of the argument. The argument's conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists is based solely on statistics that more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes. However, the argument does not consider other factors that could affect the safety of bicyclists on roads with bicycle lanes, such as the quality of the lanes or the overall safety of the roads themselves.
  
E: This criticism is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not use statistical evidence to prove the opposite conclusion. Rather, the argument uses statistical evidence to support its conclusion. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists as more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.

A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.

B: This statement is not relevant to the argument.

C: This statement is broad and does not address or weaken the argument's conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.

D: This statement is beyond the scope of the argument. The argument does not comment on the overall safety of roads with bicycle lanes, but rather notes that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.

E: This statement does not address or weaken the argument's conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument is as follows:
  - Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  - Adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.

A: This answer choice points to the possibility that the injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes. However, this does not directly criticize the argument.
B: This answer choice points to the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than on roads without such lanes. However, this does not directly criticize the argument.
C: This answer choice points out that the argument takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists. However, this does not directly criticize the argument.
D: This answer choice criticizes the argument directly by pointing out that the conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists is based on the assumption that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe. This undermines the conclusion of the argument and makes it vulnerable to criticism.
E: This answer choice suggests that the argument uses statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion. However, this is not a direct criticism of the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.

A: This answer choice is relevant to the argument, but it does not criticize the argument directly.
B: This answer choice is relevant to the argument, but it does not criticize the argument directly.
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument since the argument does not take for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
D: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument since the argument is not discussing the safety of only some roads that currently have bicycle lanes.
E: This answer choice is the most relevant to the argument since the argument takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the statistics that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads with bicycle lanes than on roads without such lanes.
  A: This option is not a direct criticism of the argument's conclusion, but rather a possible concern about injuries sustained by bicyclists on roads with bicycle lanes.
  B: This option is also not a direct criticism of the argument's conclusion, but rather a possible concern about the number of bicyclists riding on roads with and without bicycle lanes.
  C: This option is a possible criticism of the argument's conclusion, as it brings into question the assumption that enhancing the safety of bicyclists will also enhance the safety of motorists. However, this is not a direct criticism of the argument's conclusion based on the given statistics.
  D: This option is not a direct criticism of the argument's conclusion based on the given statistics, but rather a potential criticism of the argument's premise that more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes.
  E: This option is a direct criticism of the argument's conclusion based on the given statistics, as it brings into question the validity of using those statistics to draw the opposite conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the statistics that reveal more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
A: This is a possible criticism, but it is not the most vulnerable to the argument. The argument does not address the severity of injuries that bicyclists sustain in accidents on different types of roads.
B: This is not a criticism of the argument. The argument specifically refers to statistics about the number of collisions, not the number of bicyclists.
C: This is not a criticism of the argument. The argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
D: This is a possible criticism of the argument, but it misrepresents the argument. The argument does not conclude that only some roads that currently have bicycle lanes are safe.
E: This is the most vulnerable criticism. The argument takes the statistical evidence to mean the opposite of what it actually shows. The fact that more collisions occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes does not necessarily mean that adding such lanes would not enhance safety. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
Choices:
  A: This criticism is not relevant to the argument, which is only concerned with the number of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles.
  B: This criticism would strengthen the argument, which claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  C: This criticism is not relevant to the argument, which is only concerned with the safety of bicyclists.
  D: This criticism is not accurate. The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that more collisions occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. The argument does not claim that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
  E: This criticism is not relevant to the argument, which is only concerned with the number of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to improve the safety of bicyclists, and supports this claim with the fact that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.

A: This criticism is not relevant to the argument, as the argument is only concerned with the number of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads with and without bicycle lanes, and not the severity of injuries sustained in these collisions. 

B: This criticism is also not relevant to the argument, as the argument is only concerned with the number of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads with and without bicycle lanes, and not the number of bicyclists riding on these roads.

C: This criticism is not directly relevant to the argument, as the argument is only concerned with the safety of bicyclists, not the safety of motorists. 

D: This criticism is relevant to the argument, as the argument assumes that currently designated bicycle lanes are not safe, which may not necessarily be true. 

E: This criticism is not relevant to the argument, as the argument uses statistical evidence to support its claim, rather than to prove the opposite conclusion.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The argument presented is that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.

A: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument does not make any claims about the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument either. The argument does not make any claims about the number of bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes.
C: This statement is also not relevant to the argument. The argument does not make any assumptions about the impact of road alterations on motorists.
D: This statement is the closest to a valid criticism. The argument is based on statistics that do not prove that bicycle lanes are the cause of the accidents. The argument could be improved by providing more evidence or by considering alternative explanations for the statistics.
E: This statement is actually the opposite of what the argument is doing. The argument is not using statistical evidence to prove the opposite conclusion, but rather to support a claim that adding bicycle lanes is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
   - Whipping cream in a blender without enough air results in a thick, velvety substance.
   - A special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Choices:
  A: This statement aligns with the knowledge provided, so it could be true.
  B: This statement is a bit extreme and not necessarily true. The knowledge provided says the attachment helps somewhat, so it could still suffice to whip cream completely effectively depending on the situation.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument discusses a situation where a particular diet is healthier but its universal adoption would cause the extinction of marine species, making it impossible. Hence, the argument proposes not to recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
A: The argument discusses the potential risk of vitamin E supplements and proposes not to recommend everyone to take these supplements.
B: The argument discusses the impact of tobacco taxes on education funding and proposes that these taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
C: The argument discusses the spending pattern of individuals and proposes not to recommend this pattern to everyone due to its impact on the economy.
D: The argument discusses the relationship between campaigning and re-election of legislators and proposes that it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
E: The argument discusses the impact of land development on wilderness areas and proposes that it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument states that a healthier diet based on fish protein is not recommended to be universally adopted because it would lead to the extinction of many marine species. 
A: The argument here is that while there is evidence that vitamin E supplements might reduce risk of heart attack, it has not been established that it is safe for all people. Hence, vitamin E supplements should not be recommended for everyone.
B: The argument here is that while taxes on tobacco can be used to generate revenue for education, if the taxes become too high, it might lead to people smoking less, thereby reducing the funding generated for education. Hence, other sources of revenue might have to be used to supplement these taxes.
C: The argument here is that a consumer would be better off if he or she limits purchases to what is needed and invests any remaining income. However, if everyone were to do this, the economy would suffer and make saving and investing impossible for most people. Hence, this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
D: The argument here is that if legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do their jobs. However, if they did not spend time campaigning, they probably would not get re-elected. Hence, it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
E: The argument here is that if land development is restricted in wilderness areas, it would help preserve many species that inhabit these areas. However, it would also reduce the proliferation of species, such as deer, in developed areas. Hence, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument presents a situation where a particular diet is healthier but if everyone were to adopt that diet, it would lead to the extinction of the marine species on which it is based. Therefore, the argument concludes that such a universal adoption of this diet should not be recommended. 

A: This argument presents a similar situation where a vitamin E supplement is believed to be effective in reducing one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. Therefore, we should not recommend the universal adoption of vitamin E supplements. This reasoning is not similar to the argument above, as it does not present the negative consequences of a universal adoption. 
B: This argument presents the situation where governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. However, if these taxes become too high, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. Therefore, such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue. This reasoning is not similar to the argument above, as it does not present a situation where the universal adoption of a particular behavior would lead to negative consequences. 
C: This argument presents a situation where a consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. However, if everyone did this, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. Therefore, we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone. This reasoning is similar to the argument above, as it presents the negative consequences of the universal adoption of a particular behavior. 
D: This argument presents a situation where if legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. However, if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. Therefore, it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning. This reasoning is not similar to the argument above, as it does not present the negative consequences of a universal adoption of a particular behavior. 
E: This argument presents a situation where if we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. However, we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. Therefore, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas. This reasoning is not similar to the argument above, as it does not present the negative consequences of the universal adoption of a particular behavior. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a healthier diet based on fish protein cannot be universally adopted because it would lead to the extinction of many marine species that are the source of the fish protein.
A: The argument discusses the lack of conclusive evidence regarding the safety of vitamin E supplements and recommends against their universal adoption.
B: The argument discusses the potential consequences of high taxes on tobacco and the need to supplement the revenue generated by such taxes.
C: The argument discusses how a spending pattern that prioritizes saving and investing is better for individuals, but if everyone were to follow it, it would cause a severe recession, making it difficult for most people to save and invest.
D: The argument discusses why legislators spend so much time campaigning, suggesting that it is because they need to get reelected.
E: The argument discusses the trade-off between preserving wilderness areas and reducing the proliferation of certain species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument presented in the given context states that even though a fish-protein-based diet is healthier, if universally adopted it would lead to the extinction of marine species, hence it should not be recommended to everyone.
A: The argument is about not recommending a particular course of action due to safety concerns.
B: The argument is about the potential unintended consequences of taxing tobacco heavily.
C: The argument is about not recommending a particular spending pattern due to its impact on the economy.
D: The argument is about the reasons why legislators spend a lot of time campaigning.
E: The argument is about the trade-off between preserving wilderness areas and promoting the proliferation of certain species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that universal adoption of a healthy diet based on fish protein would lead to extinction of marine species. Hence, such a diet should not be recommended.
A: The argument presents a potential harm of vitamin E supplements, which means they should not be recommended universally.
B: The argument discusses the potential consequences of high tobacco taxes that could lead to reduced funding and therefore, such taxes may not be sustainable.
C: The argument suggests a better spending pattern for individuals but it could trigger an economic recession if everyone starts following it.
D: The argument explains the cause of legislators spending so much time campaigning based on their reelection prospects.
E: The argument presents a situation where restricting land development in wilderness areas could potentially harm the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument presents a situation where a healthier diet would lead to the extinction of a species and hence it is impossible. Therefore, recommending such a diet to everyone would not be the right thing to do.
A: The argument presents possible harm to some people if a supplement is not safe for everyone. Therefore, recommending it to everyone would not be the right thing to do.
B: The argument presents a situation where a tax on tobacco could negatively impact education if people smoked less. Therefore, additional sources of revenue would be needed.
C: The argument presents a situation where everyone saving or investing would lead to a recession, which would make it impossible for most people to save or invest. Therefore, recommending this spending pattern to everyone would not be the right thing to do.
D: The argument presents a situation where legislators spending less time on campaigning would lead to them not being reelected. Therefore, it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
E: The argument presents a situation where restricting land development in wilderness areas would help preserve some species but reduce the proliferation of others. Therefore, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
The argument explains that while a fish-based diet is healthier, we cannot recommend it universally as it would lead to the extinction of many marine species. 
A: This argument talks about the lack of conclusive evidence for something that is believed to reduce the risk of heart attack, so everyone should not adopt it. It does not talk about any potential harm to a specific group.
B: This argument explains how a heavy tax on tobacco with revenue spent on education might not be sustainable in the long term, and might need to be supplemented by other sources. It does not talk about any potential harm to a specific group.
C: This argument explains how limiting purchases to necessities and saving the rest can be better for individuals, but if everyone did it, it could result in a severe recession. It does not talk about any potential harm to a specific group.
D: This argument explains how legislators spend a lot of time campaigning as it is essential for re-election. It is not similar to the argument above.
E: This argument explains how restricting land development in wilderness areas can preserve many species but can also affect the proliferation of species that thrive in developed areas. It does not talk about any potential harm to a specific group.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The argument presents a situation where a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat protein. However, universal adoption of this diet would lead to the extinction of marine species. Therefore, it is not recommended to promote the universal adoption of this diet.
A: The argument presents an evidence-based claim that taking a vitamin E supplement reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, the safety of vitamin E supplements has not been conclusively established. Therefore, it is not recommended to promote the universal adoption of this supplement.
B: This argument presents a claim that governments have the right to tax tobacco heavily and spend the revenue on education. However, if the taxes become too high, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding generated for education. Therefore, such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
C: This argument presents a situation where limiting purchases to what is truly needed and saving or investing any remaining income is an advisable spending pattern. However, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession and saving and investing would become impossible for most people if everyone did this. Therefore, it is not recommended to promote this spending pattern to everyone.
D: This argument presents a situation where legislators would have more time to do their jobs if they spent less time campaigning. However, if they didn't campaign as much, they probably wouldn't get reelected. Therefore, it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
E: This argument presents a situation where restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. However, it also reduces the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas. Therefore, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that a healthy diet based on marine species would cause the extinction of these species if universally adopted, making it impossible. Therefore, it concludes that such a diet should not be recommended to everyone.

A: The argument discusses the potential risks of taking a vitamin E supplement and concludes that it should not be recommended universally. This is similar to the argument above because it discusses the potential harm of recommending something universally.

B: This argument discusses the possible negative consequences of heavy taxation on tobacco and its effects on education funding. It is not relevant to the argument about the diet based on marine species.

C: This argument discusses the potential negative effects of everyone saving and investing their money and concludes that this spending pattern should not be recommended universally. It is similar to the argument above because it discusses the potential harm of recommending something universally.

D: This argument discusses why legislators spend a lot of time campaigning, and it does not resemble the argument above.

E: This argument discusses the potential harm of designating areas as wilderness areas and concludes that it is not always clear which areas should be designated as such. It is similar to the argument above because it discusses the potential harm of an action that aims to preserve species.

  A: In the city with the worst air pollution today, the air quality is better than it was 30 years ago.
  B: No city has worse air pollution today than it did 30 years ago.
  C: Most of the public outcries against pollution came from people in the cities that had the most polluted air.
  D: The most polluted cities today are not the cities that were the most polluted 30 years ago.
  E: Public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: The passage states that stricter regulations of emissions were put in place in response to public outcries against pollution. As a result, cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: The passage states that there have been public outcries against pollution over the last few decades which have brought about stricter regulations of emissions, and that as a result, the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. Therefore, we can infer that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Choice A cannot be inferred from the passage, as it only refers to cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago, not the ones with the worst air pollution today. Choice B is incorrect because the passage only refers to cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago, not all cities. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about where the public outcries against pollution came from. Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about which cities are currently the most polluted.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage clearly states that "public outcries against pollution have brought about stricter regulations of emissions" and that "The cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality." Therefore, it can be properly inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Choice E matches this inference. The other answer choices cannot be inferred from the given statements.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

The given context suggests that over the last few decades, public outcries against pollution have led to stricter regulations of emissions, and the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Hence, the correct answer is E. 

Option A cannot be inferred as it is only mentioned that the cities with the most polluted air 30 years ago have improved air quality, not the worst air pollution today.

Option B cannot be inferred as it is not mentioned that no city has worse air pollution today than it did 30 years ago.

Option C cannot be inferred as it is not mentioned where most of the public outcries against pollution came from.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

The statements above give evidence that stricter regulations of emissions were implemented due to public outcries against pollution. Those regulations led to an improvement in air quality in cities that used to have the worst air pollution. Therefore, it can be properly inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
The statement mentions that "public outcries against pollution have brought about stricter regulations of emissions." It further states that cities that had the most polluted air improved greatly over the years, which would not have happened without these stricter regulations. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage implies that there were cities with the most polluted air 30 years ago, and that these cities have since experienced a marked improvement in air quality due to stricter emissions regulations that were brought about by public outcries against pollution. Therefore, it can be inferred that the public criticism led to an improvement in air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Hence, the correct answer is E. The other answer choices are not supported by the information in the passage.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

The statement mentions that public outcries against pollution led to stricter regulations and an improvement in air quality in cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in air quality of the most polluted cities 30 years ago. None of the other options can be inferred from the statement.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
The passage mentions that public outcries against pollution led to stricter regulations and improved air quality in cities that were once the most polluted. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Choices A, B, and D are not supported by the passage. Although choice C mentions public outcries, there is no information in the passage to suggest that most of the public outcries against pollution came from people in the cities that had the most polluted air.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

The statements indicate that stricter regulations were put in place to reduce emissions, and as a result, cities that previously had the most polluted air now have greatly improved air quality. This implies that public criticism led to an improvement in air quality, specifically in the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Therefore, the correct answer is E. Option A is incorrect because it is not mentioned which city had the worst air pollution 30 years ago or today. Option B is incorrect because it cannot be inferred that no city has worse air pollution today than it did 30 years ago. Option C is not mentioned in the context. Option D is incorrect because it is not mentioned which cities have the most polluted air today.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The employee's argument is that website filtering software blocks access to non-work-related websites under the pretext that such sites distract employees from doing their best work. However, offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can also be highly distracting, just like non-work-related websites.
  A: This argument is about how people's reactions to certain substances differ and so moderation cannot be the same for everyone. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  B: This argument is about activists calling for the banning of electronic devices based on their potential to cause cancer. The argument compares this situation to not banning chemicals that can also cause cancer in high doses. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  C: This argument is about how Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  D: This argument is about how creative writing classes emphasize that engaging characters alone do not guarantee a sale since publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that focus only on character. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  E: This argument is about how the movie industry's criterion of success by profit relative to cost is misguided since it does not take into account the counter-intuitive case where an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The employee's argument is that website filtering software blocks access to non-work-related websites on the grounds that they are a distraction, but other types of distractions (e.g. offices with windows, nicely decorated offices) are not similarly targeted, even though they may be equally or more distracting.
  A: The argument is about the fallacy of advocating moderation in all things, as different people have different reactions to certain substances.
  B: The argument is about the fallacy of banning something (in this case, an electronic device) solely because it causes cancer in laboratory animals.
  C: The argument is about the need for a company to hire 1,000 employees to replace those who are retiring.
  D: The argument is about the fallacy of assuming that engaging characters are sufficient for a novel or story to be successful, as publishers and agents also consider other elements.
  E: The argument is about the misguidedness of judging a movie's success solely in terms of its profit relative to its cost.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The employee is arguing that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not helpful for productivity since other things in the office can be equally or more distracting. 
A: This argument is about differences between individuals and how this can affect what counts as moderation for each person. 
B: This argument is about the dangers of banning an electronic device based on animal research studies, and that many chemicals could cause cancer if administered in high doses. 
C: This argument is about a company needing to hire new employees to replace those that will retire soon. 
D: This argument is about the misconception that engaging characters in creative writing guarantee the success of the book. 
E: This argument is about the misguided criterion used in the movie industry to determine the success of a film. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only possible distraction and that offices without windows or decoration can also be distracting.
A: This argument discusses that moderation is not applicable to substances since people's reaction to them can differ. It does not have the same reasoning as the employee's argument.
B: This argument discusses that banning an electronic device is not reasonable since many chemicals can cause cancer when administered in high doses, but we don't ban them. It does not have the same reasoning as the employee's argument.
C: This argument states that Acme will need to hire 1,000 people over the next year because approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire. It does not have the same reasoning as the employee's argument.
D: This argument states that engaging characters do not guarantee a sale, as publishers and agents can still reject manuscripts that emphasize character over other elements. It does not have the same reasoning as the employee's argument.
E: This argument discusses that using profit relative to cost as a measure of success in the film industry is misguided since it can make an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie look less successful. It does not have the same reasoning as the employee's argument. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The employee argues that website filtering software does not increase productivity because distractions can come from many sources and the software fails to address the root cause of the problem.
A: The argument here is that moderation is not a useful concept because people react differently to different substances.
B: The argument here is that banning a device because of its link to cancer in laboratory animals is not a good idea because many chemicals can cause cancer when administered in high doses.
C: The argument here is that Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 employees are expected to retire.
D: The argument here is that characters are not the only important element in a novel or story, and focusing on characters alone does not guarantee success.
E: The argument here is that using a film's profit relative to its cost as a measure of success is misguided because it does not take into account the fact that expensive movies may be just as successful as lower-budget ones.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The employee argues that website filtering software may not be effective at increasing productivity because other factors, such as office environments, can also be distracting. 
A: The argument is about the effectiveness of advocating moderation in all things based on individual reactions to substances. It does not relate to distractions or productivity in the workplace.
B: The argument is about banning a specific electronic device due to its relationship with causing cancer in laboratory animals. It does not relate to distractions or productivity in the workplace.
C: The argument is about the number of employees that a company will need to hire over the next year due to expected retirements. It does not relate to distractions or productivity in the workplace.
D: The argument is about the relationship between engaging characters in novels and stories and their likelihood to sell. It does not relate to distractions or productivity in the workplace.

Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filters are not the only source of distraction in the workplace, and that it is unreasonable to claim that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
  A: The argument is that moderation fails to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: The argument is that banning an electronic device for causing cancer in laboratory animals is unreasonable, because most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet we do not ban all these chemicals.
  C: The argument is that since approximately 1,000 of Acme's employees will retire over the next year, it will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: The argument is that engaging characters do not necessarily guarantee a successful sale, as publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: The argument is that judging a movie's success in terms of its profit relative to its cost is misguided, because an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is counter intuitive.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The employee argues that website filtering software does not necessarily lead to better work, since other distractions such as windows and decorations are not being filtered, and yet people can still work well in such environments.
  A: This argument criticizes the concept of moderation, saying that it does not take into account biological differences among people. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  B: This argument criticizes the idea of banning a certain electronic device due to a risk of cancer, saying that many chemicals also cause cancer but are not banned. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
  C: This argument states that Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 employees are expected to retire. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The employee's argument is that the company's rationale for blocking access to non-work-related websites is flawed because it assumes that distractions only come from websites, and ignores other potential distractions in the workplace such as window views or decorations.
  A: This argument is about biological differences affecting people's reactions to substances and how the notion of moderation can fail to account for these differences.
  B: This argument is about the fact that most chemicals can cause cancer in high doses, yet banning all these chemicals is not a reasonable solution.
  C: This argument is about the need for Acme to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year, given the number of employees retiring, and that no one would claim that Acme does not need a workforce as large as its present one.
  D: This argument is about the fact that the idea of engaging characters guaranteeing a sale is flawed because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: This argument is about the flaw in judging a film's success based solely on profit relative to cost, as an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be considered less successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
The employee argues that the company's claim that non-work-related websites are distracting is flawed because other things that are not work-related, such as decorating an office, can also be distracting without being regulated.
A: The argument is that different people have different reactions to substances, so talking about moderation is not useful.
B: The argument is that most chemicals can cause cancer in high doses, so banning one device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals is not reasonable.
C: The argument is that since 1,000 employees are retiring, Acme will need to hire 1,000 people to maintain the same work force.
D: The argument is that engaging characters are not a guarantee for success in publishing novels, as publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
E: The argument is that judging a movie's success solely in terms of profit relative to its cost is misguided because an expensive movie that sells the same number of tickets as a lower-budget movie would be considered less successful.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.
Response 0:

  The study shows that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
A: This choice provides an explanation of why the blood nicotine levels are the same, but it does not directly relate to the study's findings.
B: This choice is irrelevant to the study's findings.
C: This choice directly explains how nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker, which supports the study's findings.
D: This choice provides information about tar levels and not nicotine levels, so it is irrelevant to the study's findings.
E: This choice is not relevant to the study's findings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  A: This choice is about the amount of nicotine that can be absorbed by the blood per day, but it does not explain the study’s finding.
  B: This choice talks about the amount of cigarettes that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes smoke per day, but it does not explain the study’s finding.
  C: This choice explains that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. This explains why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  D: This choice talks about the level of tar in cigarettes and is not related to the study's findings on the levels of nicotine in the blood.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The study found that smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day end up with identical levels of nicotine in their blood regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the findings of the study, as it only pertains to the maximum amount of nicotine that can be absorbed into the blood, not the amount that is actually absorbed.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the findings of the study, as it does not address why smokers of different nicotine levels end up with the same levels of nicotine in their blood.
C: This statement is relevant, as it suggests that the method of delivery of nicotine (i.e. high- or low-nicotine cigarettes) does not affect the amount of nicotine that is ultimately absorbed into the blood.
D: This statement is also irrelevant, as it only pertains to the level of tar in cigarettes and not to the level of nicotine or its absorption into the blood.
E: This statement is also irrelevant, as it only pertains to what happens when a smoker discontinues smoking and not to the findings of the study.
Action: Answer("C")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute
  E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle (that lying is unethical) by comparing a case in which it applies (saying something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener) to one in which it does not apply (withholding relevant information in interviews to elicit new information).
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between withholding information and lying. The journalist offers an example of lying, stating that lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief. This example is used to distinguish between lying and withholding information in interviews. Therefore, the journalist is defending the distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it. Hence, the correct answer is B.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending a controversial distinction (withholding relevant information is not the same as lying) by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The journalist argues that lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief, which is different from withholding relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. The journalist is defending this distinction by arguing that the two cases are not the same and should not be treated as such. Therefore, Answer B is correct.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between withholding relevant information and lying by offering an example of a clear instance of it.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending what they consider a controversial distinction between two cases by offering an example of a clear instance of the distinction. The journalist argues that there is a difference between lying and withholding information in interviews, and that the latter is not the same as intentional deception because it does not actively encourage a false belief.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist clarifies and defends a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies (lying) to one in which it does not apply (withholding relevant information to elicit new information in interviews). Thus, the best answer is E.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist argues by defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding information for the purpose of eliciting new information by providing an example to support that argument.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist argues by defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it. Specifically, the journalist defends the distinction between lying and withholding relevant information by suggesting that, while withholding relevant information may be intentional deception, it is not the same as lying because it does not actively encourage a false belief.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the idea that withholding information in interviews is not the same as lying, by offering an example of a clear instance where the distinction between withholding information and lying is obvious. Therefore, the correct answer is B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding information by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The journalist argues that withholding information is not the same as lying because it does not actively encourage a false belief, unlike lying, which is considered unethical.

Context: Mario: I see that the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business. Evidently there's little demand for rugs in Glendale. So if you're planning to open a new business there, rugs would be one product to avoid. Renate: It's true that the store is gone, but its closing had little to do with the product it sold. All this means is that the
Question: The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: the rug store in Glendale sold rugs of inferior quality
  B: it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale
  C: it is possible to determine the market for rugs in Glendale
  D: any other stores have gone out of business in Glendale
  E: rug stores can close because of insufficient demand for rugs
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Mario and Renate are discussing the viability of opening a new business in Glendale. Mario suggests that rugs are a product to avoid due to the failure of the only rug store in Glendale. Renate disagrees that the store's closing had anything to do with the product it sold. Therefore, Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
  The dialogue is centered around the closing of a rug store in Glendale, and whether this means that rugs are not in demand in Glendale.
  A: The quality of the rugs sold in the now-closed store is not discussed.
  B: Mario suggests that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale, while Renate disagrees.
  C: The dialogue does suggest that it is possible to determine the market for rugs in Glendale, but this is not the main point of disagreement.
  D: Whether other stores have gone out of business in Glendale is not discussed.
  E: The dialogue suggests that it is possible for rug stores to close due to insufficient demand for rugs.

Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
In the dialogue, Mario claims that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale, so opening a new business that sells rugs would not be a good idea. Renate, on the other hand, disagrees with Mario and argues that the closure of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Choices A, C, D, and E are not supported by the dialogue.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The dialogue is about whether or not it would be a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale, and Mario suggests that it would not be a good idea because the only rug store in Glendale went out of business. On the other hand, Renate disagrees with Mario's reasoning and suggests that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Hence, the correct answer is B.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
 
The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Mario suggests that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale based on the fact that the only rug store has gone out of business, and implies that rugs are a product to avoid. Renate, however, disagrees, stating that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold and providing no evidence to suggest that a rug store would suffer the same fate.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
  Mario suggests that it would not be a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale because there is little demand for rugs there.
  Renate disagrees with Mario and suggests that the closing of the rug store was not due to the product it sold.

Analysis:
  Mario and Renate are discussing the idea of opening a new business in Glendale. Mario suggests avoiding rugs as a product because there is little demand for them. Renate disagrees with Mario's suggestion and argues that the closing of the rug store was not because of the product itself. Therefore, they disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge: 
  Mario suggests that because the only rug store has gone out of business there's little demand for rugs in Glendale and thus starting a new rug business is not a good idea. 
  Renate disagrees with Mario's conclusion and suggests that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold. 

Analysis:
  The disagreement between Mario and Renate is about whether opening a rug store in Glendale is a good idea or not. 
  A, C, and E are mentioned in the dialogue but they are not the subject of disagreement between the speakers.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument asserts that H pylori cannot be a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, whereas M tuberculosis cannot be a commensal because it causes tuberculosis in some people.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement weakens the argument by providing a counterexample that contradicts the argument's assertion that commensals must provide some benefit to the host organism.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument is asserting that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it may have other benefits. The argument then draws a comparison to M tuberculosis, which also causes disease in some people, but is not considered a commensal.
  
A: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning directly.
B: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning directly.
C: This statement attacks the argument's reasoning. It asserts that even if M tuberculosis does not benefit the people who harbor it, that fact alone does not preclude it from being considered a commensal. 
D: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning directly.
E: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning directly.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal just because only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick from stomach ulcers, while M tuberculosis also causes disease in only a small percentage of people who harbor it but is not considered a commensal.
A: This answer choice does not seem relevant to the argument's reasoning or to the classification of bacteria as commensals.
B: This answer choice is also not relevant to the argument's reasoning or to the classification of bacteria as commensals.
C: This answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting that the reasoning used to classify H pylori as a commensal could also apply to M tuberculosis. If people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, then the fact that only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick from it might not be enough to classify it as a pathogen rather than as a commensal.
D: This answer choice does not seem relevant to the argument's reasoning or to the classification of bacteria as commensals.
E: This answer choice does not seem relevant to the argument's reasoning or to the classification of bacteria as commensals.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that considering H pylori a commensal is misguided despite its alleged immune-boosting properties and its role in the development of stomach ulcers.
  M tuberculosis is used as a counterexample, as it is not considered a commensal despite the fact that only a small percentage of individuals who harbor it get sick.
A: This statement does not seem to affect the reasoning of the argument.
B: This statement provides information about the length of the diseases, but it does not significantly affect the argument's reasoning.
C: If people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, this could undermine the argument's claim that H pylori should not be considered a commensal due to its role in immune response.
D: The number of individuals who harbor M tuberculosis or H pylori is not relevant to whether or not they should be considered commensals.
E: This statement provides information about the number of individuals who harbor each bacterium but it does not significantly affect the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal despite allegedly strengthening immune response and causing ulcers in less than 10% of those who harbor it.
- The argument compares H pylori to Mycobacter tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis but only about 10% of those who harbor it get sick from it.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: 
The argument relies on the assumption that commensals provide some benefit to the host, and that the presence of a bacterium cannot be considered commensal if it causes harm to the host, regardless of the percentage of people affected. Choice C undermines this assumption by stating that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which weakens the argument's reasoning that low infection rates are not sufficient to classify a bacterium as a commensal. The other answer choices are either irrelevant or do not directly address the argument's reasoning.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that H. pylori cannot be considered a commensal just because it allegedly strengthens the immune system and ulcers occur in less than 10% of those who harbor it.
  A: This statement does not have any effect on the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement does not have any effect on the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the presence of a bacterium does not have to provide a direct benefit to the body to be considered a commensal.
  D: This statement does not have any effect on the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement supports the argument's reasoning by suggesting that since more people harbor H. pylori, it cannot be considered a commensal because only a small percentage of those who harbor it get sick.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is discussing whether Helicobacter pylori is a commensal or not.
  The passage argues that the fact that only a small percentage of people with the bacterium get sick from it is not enough to classify it as a commensal.
  The passage also compares this with Mycobacter tuberculosis to strengthen the argument.
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating the diseases does not relate to the classification of the bacteria as a commensal.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the duration of the diseases does not relate to the classification of the bacteria as a commensal.
C: If people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, then the comparison with H pylori is not valid, which undermines the argument's reasoning.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the number of people who harbor the bacteria does not relate to the classification of the bacteria as a commensal.
E: This statement does not undermine the argument's reasoning and is therefore not relevant to the question.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that H. pylori cannot be considered a commensal bacterium because it causes stomach ulcers in a significant proportion of individuals, unlike M. tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal bacterium despite causing illness in only a small fraction of individuals who harbor it.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement does not undermine the argument's reasoning. Whether tuberculosis lasts longer than ulcers caused by H pylori is not relevant to whether H pylori should be considered a commensal bacterium.
  C: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning, as it suggests that the presence of a bacterium that causes illness in only a small fraction of individuals does not necessarily imply that the bacterium is a commensal. 
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that just because H pylori is a bacterium that benefits human beings, it does not mean it is a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people. In contrast, it points out that M tuberculosis is also a bacterium that benefits human beings, but it is not considered a commensal even though it causes tuberculosis in only about 10% of those who harbor it.
A: This statement does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
B: This statement does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning by pointing out that people who harbor M tuberculosis do not derive any benefit from its presence.
D: The number of people who harbor M tuberculosis or H pylori is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that H pylori is more likely to be considered a commensal than M tuberculosis because more people harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The argument presents a claim that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal bacterium in the human body, and compares it to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal either. The argument suggests that the low incidence of stomach ulcers does not justify calling H pylori a commensal, even if it also strengthens immune response. 
A: This statement provides information about the treatment of the diseases caused by these bacteria, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
B: This statement provides information about the duration of the illness caused by the bacteria, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
C: This statement seems to support the argument's claim that M tuberculosis is not a commensal, but it does not provide any information that undermines the reasoning against considering H pylori a commensal.
D: This statement provides information about the relative incidence of the bacteria, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

  The argument is that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances because of an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: If the polar bear stopped and changed course several times, it may suggest that the polar bear was not using a sense of navigation to return home. 
  B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it may suggest that the polar bear was able to return home due to a familiarity with its surrounding rather than its sense of navigation.
  C: If the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, it may suggest that the polar bear was able to return home due to its ability to identify certain landmarks or familiar territory rather than its ability to navigate using its sense of direction.
  D: The fact that other species of mammal have been known to find their way home from considerable distances does not necessarily negate the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  E: The polar bear's extreme sensitivity to smell may be one of the mechanisms it uses to navigate over considerable distances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The naturalists' claim is that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances as evidenced by an instance of a polar bear that returned home after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  A: The behavior of stopping and changing course several times is not necessarily indicative of poor navigation or disorientation.
  B: The fact that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route does not necessarily diminish the bear's navigational abilities.
  C: The fact that the route traveled by the polar bear consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice does not necessarily diminish the bear's navigational abilities.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument is stating that a lack of fiber in the diet causes colon cancer and consumption of fiber prevents it. It is also comparing the colon cancer rates in Western and non-Western countries to support its argument.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, it is discussing the change in consumption over time, and it does not impact the argument's reasoning.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument. The argument focuses only on colon cancer, not other types of cancer.
C: This statement is not a criticism of the argument's reasoning, it is an assertion that some people may find it difficult to consume fiber.
D: This statement is outside of the scope of the argument, as it is not discussing the relative cancer-fighting properties of different types of fiber.
E: This statement is the most likely answer as it recognizes that there may be other factors at play beyond just the presence of fiber in certain foods that could impact colon cancer rates. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it. 
  A: The consumption of fther in many countries is not relevant to the argument. The argument is focused on the correlation between fther consumption and colon cancer incidence, not on trends in fther consumption.
  B: The argument only focuses on colon cancer, so the risk of many types of cancer is not relevant to the argument.
  C: The argument does not discuss whether fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets. It assumes that sufficient consumption of fther prevents colon cancer.
  D: This is a possible critique of the argument. The argument does not consider whether the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees. If this were the case, then the argument's conclusion that fther prevents colon cancer would be weakened.
  E: This is a possible critique of the argument. The argument does not consider whether other substances in foods containing fther tend to prevent colon cancer. If this were the case, then the argument's conclusion that fther prevents colon cancer would be weakened.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
  A: The argument does not address whether the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably.
  B: The argument does not address whether the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets.
  C: The argument does not address whether fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets.
  D: The argument does not address whether the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees.
  E: The argument does not address whether foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. It cites studies showing a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rates, and argues that Western countries with lower fiber-rich food consumption have higher colon cancer rates compared to non-Western countries with higher fiber-rich food consumption. It also cites a study in Scandinavia showing a negative correlation between cereal consumption (which is high in fiber) and colon cancer rates.

A: This information is irrelevant to the argument, which is about the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates. Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising or not does not affect the argument's reasoning.

B: This information is also irrelevant to the argument, which is about the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates. Whether high-fiber diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer or not does not affect the argument's reasoning.

C: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument. The argument does not discuss whether it is difficult for people to include fiber in their diets or not.

D: This statement is not directly relevant to the argument, which is about the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates. However, it does not necessarily undermine the argument's reasoning. The argument is claiming that fiber in general (whether in fruits and vegetables or cereals) prevents colon cancer. Even if the fiber in fruits and vegetables has different cancer-fighting properties than the fiber in cereals, the argument's main claim that fiber prevents colon cancer is not undermined.

E: This statement is the most likely criticism of the argument's reasoning. The argument assumes that it is the fiber content in foods that prevents colon cancer, and overlooks the possibility that other substances in fiber-rich foods may also be responsible for preventing colon cancer. Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to the criticism that it oversimplifies the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate in Western countries is higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, higher colon cancer rates are associated with lower consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning and has no bearing on the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
B: This statement, although potentially true, does not address the specific relationship between fiber and colon cancer that the argument examines.
C: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning as it does not address the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
D: This statement is potentially relevant, but the argument does not address this possibility. It assumes that all sources of fiber are equally beneficial in preventing colon cancer.
E: This statement is also potentially relevant as it suggests that other factors may be at play besides fiber intake in preventing colon cancer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  A: This information is irrelevant to the argument's claim that lack of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient fiber intake prevents it.
  B: This information is irrelevant to the argument's claim that lack of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient fiber intake prevents it.
  C: This information is irrelevant to the argument's claim that lack of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient fiber intake prevents it.
  D: This information is irrelevant to the argument's claim that lack of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient fiber intake prevents it.
  E: This information could be relevant to the argument's claim that sufficient fiber intake prevents colon cancer. It is possible that the other substances in foods containing fiber play a role in preventing colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  The argument provides examples of how colon cancer rates are lower in countries with high-fiber diets.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: The argument is not discussing trends in the consumption of fiber in countries. It focuses on the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer. This choice is irrelevant to the argument. 

B: This choice introduces new information on the relationship between high-fiber diets and other types of cancer. This choice is irrelevant to the argument. 

C: This choice claims that fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets. The argument does not address the issue of food accessibility. This choice is irrelevant to the argument. 

D: This choice introduces new information on the different properties of fiber in fruits/vegetables and cereals. The argument is focused on the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer, but not on comparing the properties of fiber in different foods. This choice is irrelevant to the argument. 

E: This choice suggests that foods containing fiber also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer, which could weaken the argument's claim that sufficient consumption of fiber is the only factor in preventing colon cancer. This is relevant to the argument and could potentially weaken its conclusion. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer, and that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, while sufficient consumption prevents it. 
A: The consumption of fther in many countries rising or falling does not relate to the argument's claim or reasoning. It does not add or take away from the argument's conclusion. 
B: While the risk of many types of cancer may be reduced by high-fiber diets, the argument focuses specifically on the incidence of colon cancer and does not address the effect of fther on other types of cancer. Therefore, this possibility does not weaken the reasoning behind the argument. 
C: The argument does not address whether or not fther is difficult for people to include in their diets. Therefore, this possibility does not weaken the reasoning behind the argument. 
D: The argument suggests that both fruits and vegetables and cereals are high in fiber, and that both have a preventative effect on colon cancer. Therefore, this possibility does not weaken the reasoning behind the argument. 
E: The argument does not address whether other substances that may also be found in foods containing fther have a preventative effect on colon cancer. Therefore, this possibility could potentially weaken the argument's reasoning. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. The colon cancer rate is much higher in Western countries than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: The argument is not concerned with changes in the consumption of fiber, but rather with the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
B: The argument is only concerned with the relationship between fiber and colon cancer, not with other types of cancer.
C: The argument does not address issues of feasibility or practicality of including fiber in people's diets.
D: The argument does not distinguish between different types of fiber in fruits, vegetables, and cereals.
E: This choice seems plausible, as it suggests that the relationship between fiber and colon cancer may be due to other substances present in fiber-rich foods, rather than fiber itself. However, the argument explicitly states that "All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it." Therefore, this choice cannot be the correct answer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer, and insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer while sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
A: The argument does not address this possibility, so it is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
B: The argument does not address the risk of other types of cancer, so it is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: The argument does not address the difficulty of including fiber in people's diets, so it is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
D: The argument does not address the cancer-fighting properties of different types of fiber, so it is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known
  E: takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document from a manufacturers' trade group that inadvertently listed hundreds of manufacturing companies.
  A representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, the journalist concludes that it is not a member of the trade group.
  
Analysis:
  The journalist's argument assumes that the list of companies in the document is a complete and accurate representation of the membership of the trade group. However, this assumption is not justified by the evidence provided, as it is possible that there are other companies that belong to the trade group but were not included in the list for various reasons.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document from a manufacturers' trade group that listed hundreds of manufacturing companies, and a representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. Bruch Industries is not listed in the document. The journalist then concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group.
A: The argument does not depend on whether or not Bruch Industries wants to belong to the trade group.
B: The journalist does present evidence that the document names every member of the trade group, given that a representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
C: The argument does not require an explanation of how the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document.
D: The argument does not require a reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known.
E: The journalist does take for granted the accuracy of the representative's statement without further verification or evidence.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group and the group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed in the document.
  
A: The argument is not about whether Bruch Industries wants to belong to the trade group or not, but rather it is about whether it is a member of the trade group or not. This is not the flaw in the journalist's reasoning.
B: This is a possible flaw in the journalist's reasoning. Just because Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, it does not necessarily mean that it is not a member of the trade group. There could be other reasons why Bruch Industries is not listed in the document.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument, so this is not the flaw in the journalist's reasoning.
D: This is not the flaw in the journalist's reasoning. The argument is not about why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known.
E: This is a possible flaw in the journalist's reasoning. The journalist takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information. The representative might have a reason to not reveal all the members of the trade group.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret.
  A representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed on the document.
 
Analysis:
  The journalist reasons that because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group. However, this reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the document lists every member of the trade group, which is not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist obtained a document that lists hundreds of manufacturing companies which belong to the manufacturers' trade group. 
  The representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, so the journalist concludes that it is not a member of the trade group.
  
Analysis:
  The journalist's reasoning seems to rely on the assumption that the document listing the members of the trade group is complete and accurate. However, the journalist does not present any evidence to support this assumption. It is possible that the document is incomplete or that there are other criteria for membership in the trade group that are not reflected in the document. Therefore, the journalist's reasoning may be flawed.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document from a manufacturers' trade group that listed the names of hundreds of manufacturing companies.
  A representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, hence, the journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is evidently not a member of the trade group.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The journalist's reasoning is flawed because the argument assumes that the document lists every member of the trade group, which is not necessarily true. There could be other members of the trade group who are not on the list. Therefore, the journalist does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument presented by the journalist seems to suggest that because Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, it is not a member of the manufacturers' trade group. However, there could be other reasons why Bruch Industries may not be listed, or the document may not be a comprehensive list of all the members of the group. Therefore, the journalist's reasoning may be flawed.
A: This choice is irrelevant to the journalist's reasoning in the argument.
B: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the journalist's reasoning. The document may not be a complete list of all the members of the trade group, and therefore, the journalist's conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member may be inaccurate.
C: This choice is irrelevant to the journalist's reasoning in the argument.
D: This choice is irrelevant to the journalist's reasoning in the argument.
E: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the journalist's reasoning. The journalist accepts the representative's statement as accurate without verifying it independently.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document from a manufacturers' trade group which listed hundreds of manufacturing companies. 
  The trade group representative confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed on the document.
  
A: The argument is not about whether Bruch Industries wants to belong to the trade group or not. 
B: The journalist specifically mentions that the representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
C: The argument is not about the inadvertent sending of the document. 
D: The argument is not about whether Bruch Industries would want its membership in the trade group to be known or not. 
E: This is a plausible criticism as the journalist assumes that the statement made by the representative of the trade group is accurate. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: In the argument, the journalist claims that because Bruch Industries is not listed in the document inadvertently sent by the manufacturers' trade group, it is not a member of the trade group. 

A: This choice is irrelevant to the journalist's reasoning in the argument. 
B: This choice criticizes the evidence presented by the journalist, which is not the case. The journalist does say that the representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document indeed belongs to the trade group. 
C: This choice is not relevant to the journalist's reasoning in the argument. 
D: This choice is irrelevant to the journalist's reasoning in the argument. 
E: This choice criticizes the accuracy of the statement made by the representative. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies belonging to a manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret. 
  The journalist confirmed with a representative of the trade group that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. 
  Bruch Industries is not listed in the document. 

Analysis: 
  The journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group because it is not listed in the document that the journalist received. However, there could be other reasons why Bruch Industries is not listed in the document. For example, it's possible that Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group but was omitted from the document by mistake. Therefore, the journalist's reasoning is flawed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage is discussing the life expectancy of leatherback turtles in captivity vs. in the wild.
  
A: The passage doesn't provide information about how diseases affect other large aquatic reptiles, and this information does not help to resolve the discrepancy.
  B: This statement provides information about the general life expectancy of sea turtles and is interesting, but it doesn't help to resolve the discrepancy.
  C: This statement provides a reason why leatherback turtles in the wild might not reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy. It doesn't help to resolve the discrepancy as to why captive leatherback turtles have about the same chance of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as wild leatherback turtles.
  D: This statement provides a reason why captive leatherback turtles might be susceptible to fatal diseases, but it doesn't help to resolve the discrepancy.
  E: This statement is interesting but it doesn't help to resolve the discrepancy.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about how leatherback turtles are susceptible to fatal diseases when in captivity but are still likely to reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
A: This statement is not relevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity vs the wild. 
B: This statement provides interesting information about sea turtles, but it does not resolve the discrepancy explained in the passage.
C: This statement suggests that the cause of death for most leatherbacks in the wild is due to predators, which indicates that most leatherbacks dying in the wild are not dying from diseases. This helps to resolve the discrepancy by suggesting that the diseases which attack captive leatherbacks are not the primary cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild.
D: This statement is not relevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity vs the wild.
E: This statement is not relevant to the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity vs the wild.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
Leatherback sea turtles are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity. 
The likelihood of a leatherback sea turtle reaching its maximum life expectancy does not differ much between captivity and the wild. 
We need to find a statement that resolves the apparent discrepancy of how leatherbacks are more susceptible to diseases in captivity but can still reach their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or the wild. 

A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy and does not provide any explanation.
B: This statement provides a general comparison of sea turtles with other marine animals but does not provide any information on how leatherbacks in captivity can still reach their maximum life expectancy.
C: This statement acknowledges that leatherbacks in the wild face a different set of challenges than those in captivity and hence does not provide an explanation for the apparent discrepancy.
D: This statement provides a reason why leatherbacks in captivity can be susceptible to diseases but does not explain how they can still reach their maximum life expectancy.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy and does not provide any explanation.

Action: Answer("C") 
The statement that most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy is that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators. This statement suggests that diseases are not the primary cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild, and hence the higher susceptibility to diseases in captivity may not necessarily impact their chance of reaching the maximum life expectancy.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they wouldn't face in the wild.
  Despite this, the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is similar in captivity and the wild.
  
A: Whether or not other aquatic reptiles are susceptible to fewer diseases is irrelevant.
  B: The comparison of life expectancy between sea turtles and other marine animals is not relevant to the question.
  C: Predators in the wild would not impact the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy.
  D: The knowledge of zoologists is not relevant to the question.
  E: The size of leatherbacks is not relevant to the question.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have about the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy between leatherback life expectancy in captivity versus in the wild. Therefore, this choice is not the answer.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy provided in the question. Therefore, this choice is not the answer. 
C: This answer choice may explain why leatherbacks in captivity have a similar likelihood to live up to their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild since they are not preyed on by predators. Therefore, this choice may help to resolve the discrepancy.
D: This statement is not relevant to the discrepancy provided, thus this choice is not the answer. 
E: This answer choice is not relevant to the discrepancy provided by the question. Therefore, this choice is not the answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes that leatherbacks, when subjected to captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases they wouldn't be exposed to in the wild. However, the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its maximum theoretical life expectancy is the same whether it is living in captivity or in the wild. 
A: This statement might provide interesting information, but it doesn't help explain the apparent discrepancy in the passage.
B: Although this statement provides information about the life expectancy of sea turtles in general, it doesn't help resolve the apparent discrepancy described in the passage.
C: This statement provides information about the most significant danger that leatherbacks face in the wild, but it doesn't help explain the apparent discrepancy in the passage.
D: This statement suggests that there may be difficulties in establishing an artificial environment for leatherbacks, but it doesn't help explain the apparent discrepancy in the passage.
E: This statement doesn't help resolve the apparent discrepancy between the susceptibility of leatherbacks to diseases in captivity and their likelihood of reaching maximum theoretical life expectancy.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:

  The likelihood of a leatherback turtle reaching its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same in captivity or in the wild.
  
A: This statement provides information about other aquatic reptiles and does not help to resolve the discrepancy.
B: This statement provides information about the average life expectancy of sea turtles but does not help to resolve the discrepancy.
C: This statement provides information about the reasons for the death of most leatherbacks, but does not help to resolve the discrepancy.
D: This statement explains why leatherbacks in captivity may not live as long as those in the wild. But, it does not help to resolve the discrepancy.
E: This statement does not help to resolve the discrepancy.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks in captivity can be susceptible to diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, but they have about the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity or in the wild.
  A: The number of diseases that attack leatherbacks compared to other aquatic reptiles is not relevant to the argument at hand.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles is not relevant to the argument at hand.
  C: Predators in the wild killing leatherbacks is not relevant to the argument at hand.
  D: If few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an environment suitable for captive leatherbacks, then it would weaken the argument that leatherbacks in captivity have about the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild. However, this answer choice does not directly resolve the discrepancy.
  E: If the size of a leatherback is an unreliable indicator of age, then it would weaken the argument that leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have about the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity that they don't encounter in the wild, yet their likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is similar in both conditions.
A: This statement provides information about other aquatic reptiles but does not help explain the apparent discrepancy.
B: This statement provides information about sea turtles in general but does not help explain the apparent discrepancy.
C: This statement provides information about the causes of death of leatherbacks in the wild, but it does not help explain the apparent discrepancy.
D: This statement provides information about the difficulties in establishing an artificial environment for leatherbacks, but it does not help explain the apparent discrepancy.
E: If the size of a leatherback is not a reliable indicator of its age, then it's possible that captive leatherbacks are not actually living longer than their wild counterparts. This helps resolve the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity that they are unlikely to encounter in the wild.
  Leatherbacks have similar likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy whether they live in captivity or in the wild.
  
A: This statement is not useful in resolving the discrepancy between the leatherbacks' susceptibility to diseases in captivity and their likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
B: This statement is not useful in resolving the discrepancy between the leatherbacks' susceptibility to diseases in captivity and their likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: History provides many examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. This shows that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: People correctly believe that technological innovations often cause job loss.
  B: People are often reluctant to take on new challenges.
  C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
  D: People tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations.
  E: People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety. It provides examples to support this claim.

A: This choice is not relevant to the argument since it does not directly address the impact of social inertia on human behavior.

B: This choice suggests that people may be resistant to change due to a reluctance to take on new challenges. This could support the argument's claim that social inertia is a powerful determinant of human behavior.

C: This choice contradicts the argument's claim that technological innovations are strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. It weakens the argument.

D: This choice suggests that people can easily adapt to technological innovations that are gradually implemented. This could support the argument's claim that social inertia is a powerful determinant of human behavior.

E: This choice is not relevant to the argument since it does not directly address the impact of social inertia on human behavior.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument suggests that the resistance to technological innovation is due to social inertia being more powerful than the desire for comfort or safety. 
  A: The belief that technological innovations often cause job losses may contribute to resistance, but it doesn't directly address the argument about social inertia.
  B: Reluctance to take on new challenges may also contribute to resistance, but it doesn't directly address the argument about social inertia.
  C: The fact that some technological innovations have been embraced by workers may support the argument that social inertia is a powerful force, but it doesn't necessarily undermine the argument.
  D: If people can easily adapt to gradually implemented technological innovations, it may suggest that social inertia is not as powerful as the argument suggests.
  E: The belief that technological innovations almost always increase productivity may contribute to resistance but it doesn't directly address the argument about social inertia. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety. It uses examples of resistance to technological innovation to support this claim.

A: This statement is not relevant to the argument because it doesn't address the role of social inertia in human behavior.
B: This statement might support the argument, but it does not undermine it.
C: This statement undermines the argument because it contradicts the premise that technological innovations are always resisted by workers.
D: This statement might support the argument, but it does not undermine it.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument because it doesn't address the role of social inertia in human behavior.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that social inertia (the tendency to resist change) is a stronger influence on human behavior than comfort or safety. The argument supports this by saying that historical examples show that people resisted technological innovations, even though they would have improved the workers' comfort and safety.
A: This statement does not undermine the argument. It actually supports the argument by suggesting that people resist technological innovations because they fear job loss.
B: This statement is too general. It does not refer to technological innovations, so it is not relevant to the argument.
C: This statement undermines the argument by showing that the argument is not always true. If some workers have embraced technological innovations, then the argument that social inertia always trumps comfort and safety is not universally true.
D: This statement does not necessarily undermine the argument. It suggests that people can adapt to technological innovations, but it does not show that they do so willingly or easily.
E: This statement does not necessarily undermine the argument. It suggests that technological innovations increase productivity, but it does not show that people are willing to adopt them.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety, and supports this claim by citing historical examples of resistance to technological innovations that improved working conditions. 
A: This statement may support the argument, as it suggests that people have a rational reason to resist technological innovations.
B: This statement is a generalization that does not directly address the argument.
C: This statement undermines the argument, as it suggests that social inertia is not always the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
D: This statement may support the argument, as it suggests that people can adapt to technological innovations that are gradually implemented.
E: This statement does not directly address the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The argument states that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behaviour than is the desire for comfort or safety.
A: This choice is about the belief of people about technological innovation causing job loss and does not directly relate to the argument.
B: This choice is about people being reluctant to take on new challenges and does not directly relate to the argument.
C: This choice undermines the reasoning in the argument by pointing out that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, which shows that social inertia is not always the most powerful determinant of human behaviour.
D: This choice may support the argument, but it is not a direct counter-argument.
E: This choice is about people's belief in technological innovation that increases workers' productivity and does not directly relate to the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: 
The argument states that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety. It uses historical evidence of resistance to technological innovations to support this claim. Choice C undermines this reasoning by providing a counterexample where workers embraced technological innovation. This weakens the argument's generalization and shows that social inertia is not always the most powerful determinant of human behavior. Choices A, B, D, and E do not directly address the argument's claim and are therefore not the best answer.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument states that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety. It uses the example of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable to support this claim.
A: This statement doesn't necessarily undermine the reasoning in the argument.
B: This statement doesn't necessarily undermine the reasoning in the argument.
C: This statement undermines the reasoning in the argument by providing an example where workers embrace technological innovations.
D: This statement doesn't necessarily undermine the reasoning in the argument.
E: This statement doesn't necessarily undermine the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: 
The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety. It supports this claim by citing historical examples of people resisting technological innovations that would have improved their working conditions. If it were true that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, then this would undermine the argument that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 

A, B, D, and E are not as relevant to the argument. The fact that people believe that technological innovations cause job loss (A) or increase productivity (E) does not necessarily mean that they will resist or embrace them. People being reluctant to take on new challenges (B) or being able to adapt to gradually implemented technological innovations (D) could be seen as supporting the idea of social inertia being a powerful determinant of behavior.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: 
The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety, and supports this claim with examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by workers. However, if it were true that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, then this weakens the argument's claim that social inertia always trumps the desire for comfort or safety. Instead, there may be cases where workers are willing to accept technological innovations if they see benefits to doing so. Choices A, B, D, and E are not directly related to the argument's claim about the power of social inertia, and so do not undermine it.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about Harrold Foods and its attempt to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product. 
  The argument states that "Hero" already dominates the market according to the opinion of 72% of all consumers.
  The argument also states that any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market.
  
Analysis:
  The argument uses survey results to make a conclusion that "Hero" already dominates the market and that Harrold Foods only needs to maintain its current market share to continue to dominate the market. However, the argument commits an error in reasoning by mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result. Just because "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales in the market, it does not necessarily mean that it will continue to dominate the market. Additionally, the argument assumes that "Hero" will maintain its current market share without providing any evidence to support that assumption.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the soft-drink market because its "Hero" product has more than 50% of the sales. The argument also cites a survey in which 72% of all consumers consider "Hero" to already dominate the market.
A: This error in reasoning is not present in the argument.
B: This error in reasoning is not present in the argument.
C: This error in reasoning is not present in the argument.
D: This error in reasoning is not present in the argument.
E: This error in reasoning is present in the argument where it assumes that survey results that were obtained in the past are bound to obtain in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so, based on the survey results that show that 72 percent of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
A: This answer choice is not applicable to this argument.
B: This answer choice is not applicable to this argument.
C: This answer choice is not applicable to this argument.
D: This answer choice is not applicable to this argument.
E: This answer choice is correct because the argument seems to assume that the survey results obtained in the past will remain the same in the future, which may not be the case, as market conditions and consumer behavior may change.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument is about the dominance of Harrold Foods in the soft-drink market. 
The argument bases the dominance of Harrold Foods on the result of a survey.
The survey shows that 72% of all consumers consider Harrold Foods' "Hero" to be dominant in the market.
The argument states that any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
The argument commits the error of mistaking a necessary condition for a sufficient condition, which is the mistake described in choice B. The argument assumes that because "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales, it is dominant in the market, but it does not consider the possibility that another company may have a product that is just as dominant or that may become more dominant in the future.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument tries to justify that Harrold Foods dominates the market by stating that "Hero" already dominates the market in the opinion of 72% of consumers. It assumes that maintaining the current market share is sufficient to continue dominating the market. However, merely having a higher market share does not guarantee market domination. Competitors may enter the market, and Harrold Foods may not have the ability to maintain its market share.
  
  A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This answer choice is also not relevant to the argument.
  C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This answer choice correctly points out the fallacy in the argument. The argument assumes that the past survey results are likely to hold true in the future, which may not be the case. Therefore, this answer choice describes the error in the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Hero is dominating the soft-drink market. It supports this by stating the definition of a dominant product in the market, which is any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market. It then argues that Harrold Foods already dominates the market now and only needs to maintain its current market share to continue to do so. The argument does not provide evidence that Harrold Foods will maintain its current market share in the future.

Analysis:
  A: The argument does not commit this error.
  B: The argument commits this error. It mistakes a necessary condition for a sufficient one. Just because "Hero" has more than 50 percent of the sales in the market, it doesn't guarantee that it dominates the market. 
  C: The argument does not commit this error.
  D: The argument does not commit this error.
  E: The argument does not commit this error.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument is based on the premise that any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market. The argument concludes that Harrold Foods currently dominates the market and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so based on survey results showing that 72 percent of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market. 
A: This choice is not relevant to the given argument.
B: This choice is not relevant to the given argument.
C: This choice is not relevant to the given argument.
D: This choice is not relevant to the given argument.
E: The argument commits this error of reasoning, as it describes survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument states that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" has over 50% of the sales and 72% of consumers consider it to already dominate the market.
A: This error in reasoning occurs when an argument fails to show that a given market condition is not the result of what appears to be the result of that market condition.
B: This error in reasoning occurs when an argument mistakes a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
C: This error in reasoning occurs when an argument treats the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
D: This error in reasoning occurs when an argument takes evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
E: This error in reasoning occurs when an argument describes survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well. 

The argument mistakes a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument uses survey results to support the claim that Harrold Foods dominates the market. 
  It states that any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is dominant in that market. 
  While the argument mentions a new advertising campaign, it does not provide any evidence that the campaign will be successful or that maintaining current market share will be sufficient.
  
Analysis:
  The argument makes a questionable assumption based on the definition of "dominance" in a market and survey results. The survey results suggest that the product is already dominant, but this does not necessarily guarantee continued dominance. The argument also assumes that maintaining current market share will be sufficient, without providing any evidence to support this claim. Therefore, the error in the reasoning is likely related to mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The argument is based on survey results that show that "Hero" already dominates the market in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers. It concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and will continue to do so if it maintains its current market share. 
A: This choice is not applicable to the given argument.
B: This choice is not applicable to the given argument.
C: This choice is not applicable to the given argument.
D: This choice is not applicable to the given argument.
E: The argument commits the error described in this choice by assuming that the survey results obtained in the past will continue in the future. However, there is no guarantee that the market conditions will remain the same in the future.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The journalist's statement implies that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. This is strongly supported by the statement that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. 
  Lithium is present in the atmospheres of stars that are at least as massive as the Sun, and brown dwarfs, but not in stars with less mass than the Sun.
  Lithium remains in the atmospheres of stars because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete, but it is absent in brown dwarfs because they do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The science journalist's statements indicate that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. This is because lithium remains in the atmosphere of such celestial objects due to the incomplete mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars. Their identity is determined by their mass and the presence of lithium in their atmosphere.
  Stars that are at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres due to incomplete mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces. Conversely, stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium since the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and hence their lithium cannot be consumed.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with mass between planets and stars.
  Brown dwarfs don't have fully functional nuclear furnaces; therefore, their lithium can't be consumed.
  Stars with more than the Sun's mass have lithium left in their atmosphere.
  Stars with less than the Sun's mass have fully mixed lithium.
  
A: The journalist only stated that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, but not every celestial object without lithium is a star with less mass than the Sun.
B: The journalist stated that any star at least as massive as the Sun has lithium remaining in its atmosphere because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete, but not every celestial object with lithium has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
C: The journalist did not state that no celestial object that has no lithium is a brown dwarf. This statement is too strong.
D: The journalist did not state that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun. This statement is too strong.
E: The journalist did not state that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere. This statement is too strong.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("B")
The science journalist's statements suggest that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. This is supported by the statement that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. It is also supported by the statement that a brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed. Therefore, choice B is the best answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  1. Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  2. Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  3. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  4. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  5. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Analysis:
  The journalist explains that brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and the presence or absence of lithium in their atmospheres. He also explains that stars with at least as much mass as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because of incomplete mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces. He goes on to explain that brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and their lithium cannot be consumed. 

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation:
  The journalist's statements support option E: "No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere." This option is supported by the journalist's statements that brown dwarfs are identified by the presence or absence of lithium in their atmospheres, and that stars less massive than the Sun have no lithium because it has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.

  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The statement "Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements" is most strongly supported by the journalist's statements. This statement is supported by the journalist's explanations that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete, while stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. Since brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace, they have lithium in their atmosphere, and this statement is not contradictory to the journalist's statements.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with mass greater than planets but less than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars with at least the same mass as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.

Response 5:
Knowledge: The publisher of a computer game offers a rebate for renters who purchase the game, and they predict an increase in game sales.
A: This statement does not provide any useful information to justify the prediction.
B: If the game takes several weeks to complete, it is more likely that people will rent the game multiple times before they complete it or before they decide to purchase it. This could help to explain why the rentals are exceeding expectations, and why the publisher expects future sales to exceed expectations.
C: This statement suggests that the publisher has a track record of producing popular games, which could contribute to the prediction that sales will exceed expectations.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the prediction.
E: This statement does not help to justify the prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
The rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations.
 
A: This option doesn't provide any additional information about which choice would justify the prediction.
B: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then it seems unlikely that sales will soon exceed expectations, as players will generally have the game for an extended period of time before needing to purchase it.
C: This choice may be helpful, but it doesn't provide any additional information about the current game's sales or rentals.
D: If most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, then it seems unlikely that these players will want to purchase the game after renting it. 
E: This option is not relevant to the prediction.

- The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
- Rentals of the game are exceeding expectations.
- The rate of sales now meets expectations.
- The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.

Action: Answer("B")

Justification:
If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, this means that players who rented the game and enjoyed it will either have to rent the game multiple times to complete it, or they will have to purchase it. This increases the likelihood that renters will end up purchasing the game, leading to the predicted increase in sales.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The publisher has predicted that the sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals.
The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price.

A: This statement does not provide any information that can help justify the publisher's prediction.
B: This statement implies that players take a long time to complete the game, but it does not explain how it will help justify the publisher's prediction.
C: This statement indicates that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market, but it does not explain how it will help justify the publisher's prediction.
D: This statement implies that most people do not play the game extensively after completing it, but it does not explain how it will help justify the publisher's prediction.
E: This statement does not provide any information that can help justify the publisher's prediction.

Action: Answer("B") 
The fact that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game suggests that they will be more inclined to purchase the game, rather than rent it multiple times. This increased purchase rate can help justify the publisher's prediction of an increase in sales.
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument above suggests a causal relationship between the party's economic theories and the inflation rate. However, it fails to consider other factors that could have influenced the inflation rate and assumes that the party's theories were the only possible cause of change in the inflation rate.
A: This argument suggests a causal relationship between invasion or climatic changes and changes in architecture. However, it fails to consider other factors that could have influenced the architecture in the valley and assumes that invasion or climatic changes were the only possible cause of change in architecture.
B: This argument suggests a causal relationship between the opposition party's promise to cut wages and the workers' decision not to strike. However, it fails to consider other factors that could have influenced the workers' decision and assumes that the promise to cut wages was the only possible cause of a strike.
C: This argument suggests a causal relationship between the sale of subsidiaries and the increase in stock price. However, it fails to consider other factors that could have influenced the stock price and assumes that the sale of subsidiaries was the only possible cause of change in stock price.
D: This argument suggests a causal relationship between support for the rebels and their victory in the battle. However, it fails to consider other factors that could have influenced support for the rebels and assumes that their victory was the only possible cause of support.
E: This argument suggests a causal relationship between the new weather forecasting equipment and the accuracy of forecasts. However, it fails to consider other factors that could have influenced the accuracy of forecasts and assumes that the new equipment was the only possible cause of change in accuracy.

  The argument above states that if the party's economic theories had been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. However, because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay simply because the architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. This is a non sequitur.
  
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that just because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This is a non sequitur.
  
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries simply because the stock price did not increase in the last two years. This is a non sequitur.
  
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the rebels must have won the battle simply because city residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days. This is a non sequitur.
  
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old simply because the station's ratings actually decreased. This is a non sequitur.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above assumes that a party's economic theories are flawed because the inflation rate increased instead of decreasing.
  A: The argument assumes that the architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay, so the valley people must not have been invaded at any time. This is a flawed reasoning known as a False Dilemma (assuming only two options when more than two exist).
  B: The argument assumes that workers promised not to strike, so they must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This is a flawed reasoning known as a False Cause (assuming a causal relationship between two events that are not related).
  C: The argument assumes that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This is a flawed reasoning known as a False Cause (assuming that because one event followed another, the first event must have caused the second).
  D: The argument assumes that residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days, so the rebels must have won the battle. This is a flawed reasoning known as a False Cause (assuming a causal relationship between two events that are not related).
  E: The argument assumes that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This is a flawed reasoning known as a False Cause (assuming that because one event followed another, the first event must have caused the second).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that because the party's economic theories did not work and the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were far off the mark.
A: The argument presents a conditional statement that if there were any outside changes, it would have affected the valley's architecture. However, the architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Then, the argument concludes that the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay. This argument presents a conditionality error, which means it assumes that if one thing is true, then the opposite must be false.
B: The argument presents a concern about the opposition party's promises to cut wages and suggests that workers in key industries would strike, but because workers have promised not to strike, the argument concludes that the workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This argument presents a strawman fallacy, which means it misrepresents the workers' position.
C: The argument suggests that if the company had sold its subsidiaries and purchased a new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years, but the stock price did not increase. Then, the argument concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This argument presents a false dilemma fallacy, which means it presents only two options and ignores other possibilities.
D: The argument presents an expectation that city residents would show support for the rebels if the battle were won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. The residents have shown support for the last three days. Thus, the argument concludes that the rebels must have won the battle. This argument presents a questionable cause fallacy, which means it assumes that one event caused another event without providing any evidence.
E: The argument suggests that if the new weather forecasting equipment was worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. However, the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the argument concludes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This argument presents a false dilemma fallacy, which means it presents only two options and ignores other possibilities.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above presents a conditional statement ("Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably."), and uses the fact that the consequent of the conditional statement is false ("But because the inflation rate actually increased") to conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement is false ("the party's economic theories were far off the mark").
  A: This argument presents a conditional statement ("If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or if there had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture."), but the conclusion is different. The argument concludes that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true because the consequent of the conditional statement is false ("But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay.")
  B: This argument presents a conditional statement ("Many people fear that if the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike."), but the conclusion is different. The argument concludes that the workers do not believe the opposition party will keep its promise because they have promised not to strike.
  C: This argument presents a conditional statement ("If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years."), and uses the fact that the consequent of the conditional statement is false ("But the price of the stock did not increase in that time.") to conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement is false ("Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.")
  D: This argument presents a conditional statement ("City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels if the battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed."), but the conclusion is different. The argument concludes that the rebels must have won the battle because the residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels.
  E: This argument presents a conditional statement ("If the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings."), and uses the fact that the consequent of the conditional statement is false ("But the station's ratings actually decreased.") to conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement is false ("Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.") 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument given states that if the party's economic theories had been sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. However, since the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were far off the mark.
A: The argument presents two possible scenarios and concludes that one of them must be true based on an observation about the valley's architecture.
B: The argument suggests that workers will not strike because they have promised not to, which is questionable.
C: The argument presents a hypothetical scenario and concludes that the opposite must be true based on an observation about the stock price.
D: The argument suggests that because residents have shown support for the rebels, the rebels must have won, which is not necessarily true.
E: The argument presents a hypothetical scenario and concludes that the opposite must be true based on a decrease in ratings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, since the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were not sound.
  A: This argument states that if the valley people were invaded or if there was a climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture. But because architecture remained the same, the valley people must not have been invaded. This argument does not follow the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.
  B: This argument claims that because workers have promised not to strike, they must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This argument does not follow the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.
  C: This argument claims that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase a new patent, its stock price would have doubled. But since the stock price did not increase, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This argument follows the same flawed reasoning as the argument above, where it assumes that there is a one-to-one relationship between two events and that if one event occurs, the other must also occur.
  D: This argument claims that city residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels if they were freed after winning the battle. Since residents have shown a great deal of support, the rebels must have won the battle. This argument does not follow the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.
  E: This argument states that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, its accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. But since the station's ratings actually decreased, the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This argument follows the same flawed reasoning as the argument above, where it assumes that there is a one-to-one relationship between two events and that if one event occurs, the other must also occur.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument given suggests that the party's economic theories were flawed because they did not produce the intended result, which was a decrease in inflation. This is a classic example of post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, which assumes that because B occurred after A, A must have caused B, without considering other possible factors that could have led to B.
  A: This argument involves a similar assumption that just because one event didn't happen, another event must not have happened either.
  B: This argument assumes that because workers promised not to strike, they must not believe the party will keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: This argument involves a similar assumption that just because the stock price did not increase, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: This argument assumes that because residents showed support for the rebels, they must have won the battle.
  E: This argument involves a similar assumption that just because the new equipment did not produce the intended result, it is no improvement on the old.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and if it had succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have decreased, but the inflation rate actually increased. Therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  A: The argument presents a hypothetical situation that if the valley people had been invaded or if there had been a climatic change, their architecture would have changed. But since their architecture remained the same, they must not have been invaded. This argument is flawed because the author assumes that the only reason for a change in architecture is invasion or a climatic change.
  B: This argument presents a hypothetical situation that if the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But since the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise. This argument is flawed because it assumes that workers' promises are always accurate.
  C: The argument states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase a new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Therefore, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This argument is flawed because it assumes that selling subsidiaries and purchasing the new patent is the only way to double the stock price, and there are no other factors that can affect the price of the stock.
  D: The argument presents a hypothetical situation that if the rebels win the battle and the jailed rebel leaders are freed, the city residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels. The residents have shown support for the last three days, so the rebels must have won the battle. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason for the residents' support is that the rebels won the battle.
  E: The argument states that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Therefore, the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason for the decrease in ratings is the new weather forecasting equipment. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The argument presents a conditional statement. The party's economic theories would have led to a decrease in inflation if they had been sound and implemented. However, inflation actually increased, so the argument concludes that the party's economic theories were far off the mark.
A: The argument presents a conditional statement. If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded or if there had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture. But there were no changes in the valley's architecture throughout their stay. Thus, the argument concludes that the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
B: The argument presents a conditional statement. If the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But the workers have promised not to strike. Thus, the argument concludes that these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
C: The argument presents a conditional statement. If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the argument concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
D: The argument presents a conditional statement. City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels if the battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days. Thus, the argument concludes that the rebels must have won the battle.
E: The argument presents a conditional statement.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Government official: Residents who are foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. This is wise, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. So, ____.
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the government official's statement?
Choices:
  A: foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve
  B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries
  C: only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries
  D: foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries
  E: cabinet undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. 
  The official's argument implies that a cabinet undersecretary should be a citizen of the country since they may need to perform the duties of a cabinet secretary.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  If a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable, and cabinet secretaries must be citizens, then it follows that cabinet undersecretaries must also be citizens to be able to perform the duties of the cabinet secretary. Therefore, the most logical completion of the government official's statement would be to argue that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries. Choice B is the only option that follows this logic.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether or not foreign citizens can be appointed as cabinet secretaries. 
  The official argues that no one should be appointed to a position that involves duties that person should not perform. 
  A: This statement is not directly related to the argument in the passage. 
  B: This statement contradicts the official's argument that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels. 
  C: This statement is not supported by any evidence in the passage. 
  D: This statement is the opposite of the argument made by the official. 
  E: This statement does not directly relate to the argument in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The government official is discussing the eligibility of foreign citizens to serve as public servants in the government. 
  Cabinet secretaries have some duties that require only citizens to perform. 
  A cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as a cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. 
  The official's statement suggests that no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that the person should not perform.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  Since a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as a cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable, and cabinet secretaries have some duties that require only citizens to perform, it makes sense to choose a citizen for the role of cabinet undersecretary. Therefore, the most logical completion of the government official's statement is to suggest that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries. Hence, the correct answer is B.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The government official argues that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries because cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  A: The official does not make any statement suggesting that foreign citizens serving as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve.
  B: The official does not make any argument against the appointment of foreign citizens as cabinet undersecretaries.
  C: This statement is not supported by the argument made by the official.
  D: This statement contradicts the argument made by the official that cabinet secretaries should be citizens.
  E: This statement contradicts the official's argument that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The government official stated that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. Cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens. A cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  A: While this option suggests a solution to the citizenship status of foreign citizens who serve as public servants, it does not complete the official's argument.
  B: The official does not say that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries. The official only states that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  C: The official does not say that only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  D: The official states that foreign citizens cannot be appointed as cabinet secretaries. Therefore, this option contradicts the official's argument.
  E: This option contradicts the statement that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as a cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The government official states that foreign citizens cannot serve as cabinet secretaries since some duties of the position can only be performed by citizens and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties they cannot perform. Cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
  The government official argues that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable, and there are some duties that only citizens can perform. Since undersecretaries may have to perform these duties in the absence of the secretary, it would follow that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries. Choice B makes the most logical completion of the government official's statement.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The government official believes that:
  - Foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries.
  - Cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  - No one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform.
  - A cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
  If the official believes that cabinet secretaries should not be foreign citizens because they perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, then it would make sense for the official to also think that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries. This is because undersecretaries are expected to serve as secretaries when the latter are unavailable, meaning that they would be performing the same duties as cabinet secretaries that should be performed only by citizens. Therefore, (B) is the best answer choice.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The government official is explaining the rationale behind allowing foreign citizens to serve as public servants, but not as cabinet secretaries. Cabinet secretaries perform duties that should be performed only by citizens, and a cabinet undersecretary may be expected to serve as the cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
A: This statement goes beyond the scope of the argument. The argument does not address granting citizenship to foreign citizens who serve as public servants.
B: This statement contradicts the argument presented in the passage. The passage explains that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, including cabinet undersecretary, since the actual cabinet secretary may be unavailable.
C: This statement does not logically follow from the argument and is not relevant to the discussion of foreign citizens serving as cabinet secretaries.
D: This statement contradicts the argument presented in the passage. The passage explains that cabinet secretaries perform duties that should be performed only by citizens, and therefore foreign citizens should not be appointed to that position.
E: This statement contradicts the argument presented in the passage. The passage explains that a cabinet undersecretary may be expected to serve as the cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The government official believes that foreign citizens should be allowed to serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries since some duties should only be performed by citizens. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  A: This choice is not directly related to the argument made by the government official.
  B: In the argument, the government official did not indicate any issues with foreign citizens serving as cabinet undersecretaries.
  C: This choice is not directly related to the argument made by the government official.
  D: This contradicts the argument made by the government official that some duties performed by cabinet secretaries should only be performed by citizens.
  E: This contradicts the argument made by the government official that a cabinet undersecretary should be expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The government official believes that:
    - Foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels
    - Foreign citizens cannot serve as cabinet secretaries
    - Cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable
  The government official argues that the restriction on foreign citizens serving as cabinet secretaries is wise, because it is important that the duties of cabinet secretaries are performed by citizens, and because undersecretaries may be called upon to perform the duties of the secretary.
  
Action: Answer("D")
The option that most logically completes the government official's statement is "foreign citizens should not be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries". This follows from the official's argument that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and thus no one other than a citizen should be appointed to the position.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that we need to regulate wetland development in Figoria and offset it by constructing replacement wetlands to protect wildlife species.
  Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria has conserved its wetlands, and development might not affect wildlife. It is necessary for growth and they have the same right to govern their own resources as other countries.
  A: This principle advocates for international regulation of national resources to protect wildlife. It does not support either commission's positions.
  B: This principle prioritizes the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved over the economic needs of individual nations. It does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  C: This principle recommends regulation only after a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found. It does not support either commission's positions.
  D: This principle argues that environmental regulation cannot allow for different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. It does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that the development of wetlands for residential and commercial uses endangers many species, and to protect wildlife, wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. The Figorian Development Commission, however, argues that Figoria has conserved its wetlands and that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth. They believe that they have as much right to govern their own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.

A: This principle argues that national resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered. It does not provide any support for the Figorian Development Commission's position, which focuses on Figoria's right to govern its own resources without interference from international agreements.

B: This principle argues that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations. This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, not the Figorian Development Commission's position.

C: This principle argues that regulation should be implemented only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found. This principle does not provide any support for the Figorian Development Commission's position, which is arguing that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife.

D: This principle argues that environmental regulation must aim at preventing further environmental damage and cannot allow for different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, not the Figorian Development Commission's position.

E: This principle argues that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources. This principle does not provide any support for the Figorian Development Commission's position.

A: This principle suggests that national resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered, which supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
B: This principle suggests that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations, which supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
C: This principle suggests that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found, which weakly supports the Figorian Development Commission's position, but does not strongly support it.
D: This principle suggests that environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment, which weakly supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, but does not strongly support it.
E: This principle suggests that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources, which weakly supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, but does not strongly support it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission supports the regulation of wetland development while the Figorian Development Commission is against such regulation.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figoria has the right to govern its natural resources without intervention from other countries.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  A: This principle does not support either position. It suggests that international agreement should regulate national resources to protect wildlife, which goes against the Figorian Development Commission's position about governing its resources without intervention. It also suggests that regulation should be implemented, which supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, but it does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the regulation.
  B: This principle supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, but it does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the regulation.
  C: This principle supports the Figorian Development Commission's position against the regulation, but it does not support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position for the regulation.
  D: This principle supports the Figorian Development Commission's position against the regulation, but it does not support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position for the regulation.
  E: This principle supports the Figorian Development Commission's position against the regulation, but it does not support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position for the regulation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues for the regulation of wetland development and the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife. They argue that this would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. 
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth. They argue that they have as much right to govern their own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
  A: This principle suggests that international agreement should regulate national resources when wildlife is endangered. It does not support one argument over the other.
  B: This principle suggests that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations. It supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument for the regulation of wetland development to protect wildlife.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist's argument is that a bill that would benefit most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will not be passed if the people who would be adversely affected by the bill are influential. The columnist argues that this shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. Option B most helps justify the columnist's argument by stating that in a well-functioning democracy a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the fact that a bill, which is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights, will not be passed into law due to the opposition of influential people is an indication that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. Choice B most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning by suggesting that a well-functioning democracy should eventually pass any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist argues that the fact that the bill will not be passed, even though it is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights, shows that the democracy is not well-functioning. Therefore, the most helpful principle to justify the columnist's reasoning is that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law if the democracy is well-functioning. Choice B best captures this principle.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

The columnist argues that even though most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years and this shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. The principle that best justifies the columnist's reasoning is that if a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This is because the columnist argues that those people who would be adversely affected by the bill are very influential, leading to the bill not being passed even though most people favor it. Therefore, the principle in option B helps justify the columnist's reasoning.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The columnist argues that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights is not likely to become law in a democracy where influential people oppose it.
  A: The principle stated in option A is contrary to the columnist's argument, which is that a bill that benefits most people may not become law in a democracy that is not well-functioning.
  B: The principle stated in option B is consistent with the columnist's argument that a bill may not pass into law in a democracy where influential people oppose it, even if most other people favor it.
  C: The principle stated in option C is consistent with the columnist's argument that the passage of a bill favored by most people is dependent on the influence of those who oppose it.
  D: The principle stated in option D does not address the issue raised by the columnist, which concerns the passage of a bill that benefits most people but is opposed by influential individuals.
  E: The principle stated in option E is similar to option A and not consistent with the columnist's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights, will not be passed into law if those who oppose it are very influential. The columnist also claims that this situation shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy.
A: This statement contradicts the columnist's argument since the columnist claims that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights, will not necessarily be passed into law, even if the country is a democracy.
B: This statement supports the columnist's argument that if a bill is opposed by influential people, it will not become law, even if it is favored by most other people. 
C: This statement supports the columnist's argument that a bill favored by most people may not become law if those who oppose it are very influential. 
D: This statement is not relevant to the columnist's argument, which focuses on the effect of influential people on the passage of a bill. 
E: This statement contradicts the columnist's argument since the columnist claims that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights, will not necessarily be passed into law, even if the country is a democracy. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist is suggesting that the fact that a bill that is favored by most people (and that does not violate anyone's basic human rights) will not be passed into law because of those who are opposed to it and are influential suggests that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. Only option B suggests that if a democracy is well-functioning, a bill opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law, which is in line with the columnist's reasoning. None of the other options address the issue of influential people opposing a bill that most people favor.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and that doesn't violate anyone's basic human rights will not be passed for many years, if at all, because of the strong opposition of influential people. The columnist concludes that this shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy.

A: This principle implies that any bill that would benefit most people will be passed within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights, but the columnist argues that this is not happening in this case.
B: This principle supports the columnist's argument that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will not pass into law in a well-functioning democracy.
C: This principle implies that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential, but the columnist argues that this is not happening in this case.
D: This principle implies that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights, but the columnist argues that this is not happening in this case.
E: This principle implies that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, but the columnist argues that this is not happening in this case.

Option B is the best answer as it supports the columnist's argument that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will not pass into law in a well-functioning democracy.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that although most people favor the bill, it will not be passed into law because those who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. Therefore, the columnist implies that the democracy is not functioning well. Choice B reflects this reasoning, stating that if a democracy is well-functioning, a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This principle supports the columnist's conclusion that the democracy is not well-functioning. The other choices are either too strong or too weak to justify the columnist's reasoning.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge: 
  The columnist argues that a bill that benefits most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law because of the influence of those who would be adversely affected.
  A: This principle suggests that a bill that benefits most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights should be passed within a few years in a well-functioning democracy, which contradicts the columnist's argument.
  B: This principle suggests that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law in a well-functioning democracy, which supports the columnist's argument.
  C: This principle suggests that a bill favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential, which does not explain the columnist's argument that influential people can prevent the passage of a bill that most people favor and does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  D: This principle suggests that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights, which is not relevant to the columnist's argument about why a bill that most people favor and does not violate anyone's basic human rights may not be passed into law.
  E: This principle suggests that a bill that most people favor and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy, which contradicts the columnist's argument that such a bill may not be passed into law even in a well-functioning democracy. 

Therefore, B is the most suitable choice.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise
  C: criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself
  D: taking lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim
  E: presupposing what it sets out to establish

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The biologist's argument is that humans' configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
- They give an example of if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges instead of five, then we would be content with six fingers.
A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
B: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument and does not strengthen it.
C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers may be based on our prejudices.
E: This statement supports the biologist's argument by providing evidence that there are fish with six phalanges in their fins, which makes the idea of humans having six fingers more plausible.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that there is nothing inherently better or worse about having five fingers.
  A: This statement is not related to the argument being made by the biologist.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument being made by the biologist. It also makes an unsupported assumption about human psychology.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument being made by the biologist. It also makes an unsupported assumption about human psychology.
  D: This statement supports the argument being made by the biologist that the usefulness of our fingers is a product of our perception rather than an objective fact.
  E: This statement is somewhat relevant to the argument being made by the biologist, as it supports the idea that there is nothing inherently special about having five phalanges in a limb.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist is arguing that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the best or most useful configuration, and that if humans had evolved from a fish with six phalanges, then having six fingers on each hand would be just as useful. 
  A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument because the argument is not about whether or not people are content with their fingers.
  B: This answer choice actually weakens the argument by suggesting that humans would not be content with a less useful configuration of fingers.
  C: This answer choice is also irrelevant to the argument because the argument is not about whether or not people are equally content with two things.
  D: This answer choice supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that people's perceptions of the usefulness of their fingers is not necessarily based on fact.
  E: This answer choice is not directly relevant to the argument either, as the argument is not about whether or not any species of fish had six phalanges. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The biologist's argument is that humans' current configuration of fingers is not inherently more useful than other possible configurations. This implies that humans are content with their current configuration because it is the one they have always had, not because it is inherently better.
A: This statement does not address the issue of whether humans would be equally content with a different configuration if that were the one they had always had.
B: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are not content with things that are not equally useful.
C: This statement supports the biologist's argument, but it is not required to strengthen it, since the argument does not depend on whether humans are always equally content with things of equal usefulness.
D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not inherently greater than other possible configurations.
E: This statement provides evidence that the biologist's hypothetical scenario is plausible and could have occurred in reality.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Biologist thinks that humans are not inherently predisposed to have five fingers since there are other possible configurations.
  A: The contentment of people with the current configuration of fingers is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This is a general statement that, even if true, does not directly relate to the argument.
  C: This is a general statement that, even if true, does not directly relate to the argument.
  D: This strengthens the argument by suggesting that it is our prejudices that make us believe that our configuration of fingers is more useful.
  E: If there is a species of fish with six phalanges in its fins, it could support the biologist's claim that it is possible for humans to have six fingers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The biologist is arguing that the number of fingers humans have is arbitrary and that humans would have been just as content with a different number of fingers if evolution had taken a different course. 

A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not based on objective criteria.
E: This statement provides evidence that it is possible for a fish to have six phalanges in its fins, which strengthens the biologist's argument that humans could have evolved to have six fingers if the fish they descended from had six phalanges in its fins.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The biologist argues that humans would have been just as content with six fingers per hand if our ancestors descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins. 
A: This claim is too extreme and not likely to be true.
B: This claim doesn't support the biologist's argument or provide any evidence.
C: This claim doesn't support the biologist's argument or provide any evidence.
D: This claim supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is based on our prejudices.
E: This claim directly supports the idea that it is possible for a fish to have six phalanges, which strengthens the biologist's argument that humans could have had a different number of fingers if our ancestors descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The biologist's argument is that humans' configuration of five fingers is no more or less useful than other possible configurations, and that if we had evolved from a fish species with six phalanges in its fins, we would be just as content with six fingers on each hand.
  A: This statement doesn't provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
  B: The assertion that humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness goes against the biologist's argument that humans could be content with six fingers on each hand.
  C: This statement supports the biologist's argument, but it is too broad and absolute to be considered as the best answer choice.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is influenced by our prejudices.
  E: This statement provides some evidence to support the biologist's argument that it is possible for a fish species to have six phalanges in its fins, which strengthens their argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the optimal number.
- The argument is based on the idea that our current number of fingers is due to historical contingencies and not necessarily because it is the most useful configuration.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument being made.
B: This statement makes a claim about human contentment, but it is not directly related to the argument being made about the usefulness of different finger configurations.
C: This statement is a generalization about human contentment, but it does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our finger configuration is based on our prejudices rather than on objective criteria.
E: This statement is relevant to the argument being made, as it suggests that an alternative configuration of fingers is biologically possible.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The biologist argues that the number of fingers that humans have is not due to necessity, but rather to historical contingency.
- The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers on each hand.
- The question asks which answer "most strengthens" the biologist's argument.

Analysis:
- Answer choice A is irrelevant to the argument, because the argument is not about whether people are content with the present configuration of fingers.
- Answer choice B contradicts the biologist's argument, because the argument is that humans could be content with many different configurations, not just equally useful ones.
- Answer choice C supports the biologist's argument, but it does not "strengthen" the argument, because the argument is already based on this assumption.
- Answer choice D supports the biologist's argument, but it does not "strengthen" the argument, because the argument already assumes that the perceived usefulness of our fingers is due to our prejudices.
- Answer choice E supports the biologist's argument, because it provides evidence that six-phalange fish exist, which strengthens the plausibility of the argument that humans could have descended from such a fish.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The detective argues that the embezzler is more likely to be an actuary than an accountant, as accountants probably would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
A: This statement weakens the argument because if the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized than those of the accountants, then it is possible that an accountant could have committed the crime without getting caught.
B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside the company could have accessed the financial records and committed the crime, rather than someone within the company.
C: This statement does not weaken the argument as it is just a fact about the number of accountants and actuaries on staff.
D: This statement does not weaken the argument as it is just a fact that an independent report was released before the crime took place.
E: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the actuaries may not have had as easy access to the internal financial records as the accountants did, making it less likely that an actuary committed the crime.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary, but it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because an accountant would probably not make the mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: If the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized by supervisors, it would be less likely for one of them to commit the crime, which would weaken the detective's argument.
  B: If someone outside XYZ Corporation had access to internal financial records, it would be less likely that the embezzler was one of the actuaries or accountants, which would weaken the detective's argument.
  C: If there are more accountants than actuaries, it would be less likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries, which would weaken the detective's argument.
  D: If an independent report before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, it would weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records to commit the crime.
  E: If security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to access internal financial records than for the accountants, it would be less likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries, which would weaken the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely an actuary, not an accountant, because the embezzler made mistakes in ledger entries, which accountants wouldn't make. 
  A: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that the accountants' activities were less closely scrutinized than those of the actuaries.
  B: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that someone outside the company could have had access to internal financial records.
  C: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that there are many more accountants than actuaries at XYZ Corporation, making it more likely that an accountant is the embezzler.
  D: This does not directly weaken the detective's argument, as the report was released before the crime took place and does not provide evidence about who committed the crime.
  E: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that it may have been more difficult for the actuaries, rather than the accountants, to have access to the internal financial records.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The detective's argument is based on the presumption that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary, and that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized than those of the accountants, it would suggest that it would be even less likely for an actuary to embezzle than for an accountant to do so, and thus it would strengthen the detective's argument. Therefore, A is the correct answer, as it does not weaken the detective's argument.
  B: If persons outside of XYZ Corporation could have had access to internal financial records, it would suggest that the culprit might not be an employee of the corporation, and therefore it would weaken the detective's argument.
  C: If XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants and only two actuaries, it would suggest that it is more likely for the embezzler to be an accountant than an actuary, and therefore it would weaken the detective's argument.
  D: If an independent report concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, it would suggest that the crime was not committed by an insider with specialized knowledge, and therefore it would weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If certain security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, it would suggest that the embezzler is more likely to be an accountant than an actuary, and therefore it would weaken the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is more likely to be one of the actuaries than one of the accountants because the embezzler had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, and accountants would not make the kinds of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized than those of the accountants, then it would be less likely that one of the actuaries could have embezzled money without being detected. This weakens the detective's argument.
  B: If outsiders had access to internal financial records, then it's possible that the embezzler was not an employee of XYZ Corporation at all. This weakens the detective's argument.
  C: If there are more accountants than actuaries at XYZ Corporation, then it is more likely that the embezzler was an accountant. This weakens the detective's argument.
  D: The fact that an independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement does not weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, then it is less likely that one of the actuaries embezzled money. This weakens the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The detective presumes that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary based on specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records.
  The detective rules out accountants as suspects because they would not make mistakes in ledger entries that would lead to the discovery of the embezzlement. 
  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized by supervisors, then this would make it less likely that an actuary would have been able to embezzle money without being caught. This strengthens the detective's argument rather than weakening it. 
  B: If there was evidence of breaches in computer security that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records, then it would make it less likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries or accountants. This weakens the detective's argument. 
  C: The fact that XYZ Corporation employs more accountants than actuaries does not weaken the detective's argument. 
  D: The independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, but this does not weaken the detective's argument. 
  E: If certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, then this would make it less likely that an actuary was the embezzler. This weakens the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of the two actuaries at XYZ Corporation, because it requires specialized knowledge to embezzle and an accountant would not make the mistakes that were made. 
  A: This weakens the detective's argument because closer scrutiny would make it more difficult for an actuary to embezzle without being caught.
  B: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that the breach in security could have given an outsider access to the records.
  C: This does not directly weaken the detective's argument.
  D: This does not directly weaken the detective's argument.
  E: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that it would be more difficult for the actuaries to access the records.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: If the actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants, this weakens the argument that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because it suggests that it would be more difficult for an actuary to embezzle without being detected.
  B: If there is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records, this weakens the argument that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because it suggests that someone outside the company could be responsible for the embezzlement.
  C: The number of accountants and actuaries employed by XYZ Corporation is not relevant to the detective's argument.
  D: If an independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, this does not weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries.
  E: If certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, this weakens the argument that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because it suggests that an actuary would be less likely to have the access required to embezzle. 
Action: Answer("D")

Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Movie executives aim to maximize the number of people who see a film in order to generate revenues from ticket sales.
  Television executives do not aim to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  
A: This option discusses the willingness of people to see a film more than once or to watch a television show more than once, but it does not explain the primary difference in goals between movie and television executives.
B: This option discusses the profits of movie theaters and how they are generated, but it does not explain the primary difference in goals between movie and television executives.
C: This option discusses the average cost of producing an hour of film and an hour of television, but it does not explain the primary difference in goals between movie and television executives.
D: This option suggests that television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This could explain why television executives' primary goal is not to maximize the number of viewers, but rather to attract viewers with a higher purchasing power.
E: This option discusses the popularity of television shows for which viewers do not have to pay. However, it does not explain the primary difference in goals between movie and television executives.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film.
  It is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  A: More people being willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once does not help to explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  B: The fact that there is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers does not help to explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film being much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television does not help to explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  D: Television shows making their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows being shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch does not help to explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film so it generates more revenue from ticket sales.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Choices:
  A: More people seeing a film more than once does not explain the primary difference in goals between movie and television executives since television shows can also be watched multiple times.
  B: The absence of a refreshment market in television doesn't explain the difference in the primary goals between movie and television executives.
  C: The difference in the cost of producing a film vs. producing an hour of television doesn't explain the difference in primary goals of movie and television executives.
  D: If television shows make their profits from sponsors who are seeking purchasing power of viewers, it could explain why television executives do not focus on maximizing viewership. However, this does not provide a direct comparison to the primary goal of movie executives.
  E: This option provides a possible explanation for the primary goal of television executives since many popular television shows are free to watch. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Movie executives primary goal is to maximize the number of people who see their films. 
  Television executives do not have the primary goal of maximizing viewership.
Choice analysis:
  A: This does not explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives. 
  B: This does not explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives. 
  C: This answer choice provides a possible explanation for the difference in goals between movie and television executives. If the cost of producing a film is much greater than producing a television show, then the risks of making a movie are higher. Movie executives thus prioritize maximizing the number of people who see their film to ensure they recoup the high costs of making it. On the other hand, television executives may prioritize other goals such as producing content that attracts a specific demographic or creating a show that wins critical acclaim.  
  D: This may be one of several factors that explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives, but it does not provide the most plausible explanation. 
  E: This does not explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film, because it makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it.
  The primary goal of television executives is not necessarily to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Choice Analysis:
  A: This statement might help explain why movie executives want to maximize viewership, but it does not help explain why television executives do not have the same goal.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  C: This statement might help explain why movie executives want to maximize viewership, but it does not help explain why television executives do not have the same goal.
  D: This statement suggests that television executives have a different primary goal than movie executives, because television shows are sponsored and the purchasing power of viewers is important to sponsors.
  E: This statement might help explain why television executives do not have the same goal as movie executives, because some of the most popular television shows are free to watch and do not generate revenue directly from viewership.
Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The principle mentioned in the context is that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  A: Riley parked his car in the center lane of Main Street, even though he would have realized that it could lead to a traffic accident if he had thought about it. Therefore, he can be blamed for any traffic accidents that occur as a result of his parking.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. Thus, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, and he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, Dr. Fitzpatrick can be blamed for any negative effects experienced by the patient.
  E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm, and any reasonable person could have foreseen that it would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp can be blamed for starting the fire.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The principles state that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: Riley did not foresee that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident, but it is reasonable to expect him to foresee that. Therefore, Riley should be blamed for this accident.
B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, and she could not have reasonably foreseen this. Therefore, Oblicek should not be blamed for the business going bankrupt.
C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Therefore, Gougon could be blamed if the hollandaise sauce does make his guests ill.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine without knowing that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, and it is reasonable to expect any reasonable person to foresee that this could start a fire. Therefore, Kapp should be blamed for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The principle discussed in the context states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: The scenario describes a person who unwittingly caused a traffic accident but could not have reasonably foreseen it. This aligns with the principle, so A is the correct answer.
B: The scenario describes a person who unwittingly caused a business to go bankrupt but could not have reasonably foreseen it. This aligns with the principle, but there is no mention of blaming the person, so B is not the best answer.
C: The scenario describes a person who had reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, which goes against the principle. Therefore, C is not the best answer.
D: The scenario describes a person who unwittingly caused a patient's blood pressure to increase but could not have reasonably foreseen it. This aligns with the principle, but the question asks which scenario it justifies, not who to blame, so D is not the best answer.
E: The scenario describes a person who dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves and started a fire, which any reasonable person could have foreseen. This goes against the principle. Therefore, E is not the best answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: A person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: Riley did not realize the potential misfortune of parking his car in the center lane of Main Street. Therefore, if a traffic accident occurs as a result of Riley's parking, he should not be blamed for it.
B: Oblicek had no reason to foresee that suggesting a loan to her brother would cause his business to go bankrupt. Therefore, if the loan causes the business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
C: Gougon was concerned that serving hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, but he had no reason to believe that would happen. Therefore, if the guests become ill, Gougon should not be blamed for it.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know that giving the wrong medicine would cause the patient's blood pressure to increase. Therefore, if no one else knowingly contributed to the patient's increased blood pressure, only Dr. Fitzpatrick should be blamed for it.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which any reasonable person could foresee would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The question asks which reasoning is best justified by the principles given. The principles are that a person who brings misfortune unwittingly and couldn't have reasonably foreseen it should not be blamed. The question will ask which situation is best justified by these principles. 
A: Riley's case is similar to the principles given. Riley did not foresee that parking his car in the center lane of Main street could lead to a traffic accident, and a traffic accident did occur. Therefore, Riley should not be blamed for the accident.
B: Oblicek's case is similar to the principles given. Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, and she could not have reasonably foreseen this. Thus, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
C: Gougon's case does not align with the principles given. Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Therefore, if the sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick's case is not aligned with the principles given. He gave the patient the wrong medicine, which caused the patient to have increased blood pressure. Whether or not he knew the outcome, he knowingly gave the wrong medicine, so he should be blamed for it.
E: Kapp's case is not aligned with the principles given. Although she might not have realized that dropping a lit cigarette on dry leaves would start a fire, it is reasonable to assume that it would. Therefore, she should be blamed for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The principles stated in the context suggest that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: The example justifies the reasoning that if a person could not have reasonably foreseen the misfortune, then they should not be blamed for it.
B: The example justifies the reasoning that if a person had no idea that their suggestion or action could lead to misfortune and could not have reasonably foreseen it, then they should not be blamed for it.
C: The example does not justify the reasoning as Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill but still went ahead and served it.
D: The example does not justify the reasoning as Dr. Fitzpatrick gave the wrong medicine to his patient and thus can be blamed for the misfortune.
E: The example does not justify the reasoning as any reasonable person could have foreseen the misfortune, and Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, leading to the fire. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The principles state that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: Although Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident, any reasonable person could have foreseen this. Therefore, Riley should be blamed for any traffic accident that results from his parking his car in the center lane of Main Street.
B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, and it is not reasonable to expect her to have foreseen this outcome. Therefore, Oblicek should not be blamed for her brother's business going bankrupt due to the loan.
C: Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, which indicates that he could have foreseen this outcome. Therefore, Gougon should be blamed for any illness that results from serving the hollandaise sauce.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know that giving the patient the wrong medicine would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for the patient's increase in blood pressure.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which any reasonable person could have foreseen would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp should be blamed for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The question asks which of the following best justifies the reasoning that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if they could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: Riley unwittingly parked his car in the center lane of Main Street without realizing it could cause a traffic accident. If this results in a traffic accident, he should not be blamed for it.
B: Oblicek made a suggestion to her brother without realizing it would cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, and she could not have reasonably foreseen this. If the loan causes the business to go bankrupt, she should not be blamed for it.
C: Gougon was concerned that serving hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, but he had no reason to think it actually would. If it does make his guests ill, he should be blamed for it.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine without knowing it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. If no one else knowingly contributed to the patient's condition, only Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm without realizing it could start a fire. However, any reasonable person would have foreseen this, so Kapp is to blame for starting the fire.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The principle mentioned in the context is that if a person unwittingly brings about misfortune and s/he could not reasonably have foreseen it, s/he should not be blamed for it.
A: Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. If a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it. Hence, the principle mentioned in the context would justify the reasoning in this option.
B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother to take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. If the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it. Hence, the principle mentioned in the context would justify the reasoning in this option.
C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it. This option goes against the principle mentioned in the context, as Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce could make his guests ill, so he could have reasonably foreseen it.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, and he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. If no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it. This option is similar to the principle mentioned in the context, so it could be a possible answer, but it includes an extra condition that no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, which is not part of the principle.
E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there. This option goes against the principle mentioned in the context, as any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire and Kapp's action caused the fire.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage argues that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  A: Riley parked his car in the center lane of Main Street, but did not realize it could lead to a traffic accident. Therefore, if an accident does occur, the passage argues that Riley should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek suggested to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business, but did not realize this would cause the business to go bankrupt. Therefore, if the loan does cause the bankruptcy, the passage argues that Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon did not think serving hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but was concerned that it might. Therefore, if the sauce does make his guests ill, the passage does not support the idea that Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine and did not know it would cause increased blood pressure. The passage argues that if no one else knowingly contributed to the patient's increased blood pressure, then only Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, and any reasonable person could have foreseen that this would start a fire. Therefore, the passage does not support the idea that Kapp should not be blamed for starting the fire.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument is that people who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue cannot be part of juries for trials that involve that issue, so trial by jury is not fair.
A: This statement supports the argument by saying that jurors without specialized knowledge may not understand the testimony given. Therefore, it does not weaken the argument.
B: This statement also supports the argument by saying that jurors with more knowledge are more likely to be prejudiced. Therefore, it does not weaken the argument.
C: The statement is about the fairness of appointing an impartial arbitrator, which is not relevant to the argument. Therefore, it does not weaken the argument.
D: The statement is about the tendency of experts to hedge their conclusions, which is not relevant to the argument. Therefore, it does not weaken the argument.
E: This statement weakens the argument by providing an alternative reason why some people cannot have access to specialized knowledge. If people involved in litigation cannot afford expert witnesses, then they cannot have specialized knowledge and trial by jury may be the only option. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving issues where specialized knowledge is relevant because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries.
  A: The option supports the argument by suggesting that people without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony given.
  B: The option also supports the argument by suggesting that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced.
  C: The option is irrelevant to the argument because it suggests appointing an impartial arbitrator, not a jury or the exclusion of people with specialized knowledge.
  D: The option is irrelevant to the argument because it discusses how experts give testimony, not the inclusion or exclusion of jurors.
  E: The option weakens the argument by suggesting that expert witnesses may be too expensive for people involved in litigation to afford, indicating that the specialized knowledge is not systematically excluded.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument is that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries, making trial by jury unfair for disputes involving technical issues.
A: The more complex the issue, the harder it is for non-experts to understand the testimony. This strengthens the argument, so it is not the correct answer.
B: This suggests that jurors with knowledge of the issue may be biased, which could support the argument. Thus, it is not the correct answer.
C: This is irrelevant to the argument that trial by jury is unfair. Thus, it is not the correct answer.
D: This suggests that expert testimony is not always definitive, which could weaken the argument by showing that having only non-experts on a jury does not necessarily mean that important scientific or technical information will be left out. Thus, it is a potential answer.
E: This is also irrelevant to the argument, so it is not the correct answer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the dominant view that it formed from the fossilized remains of living organisms.
  A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument about the origin of petroleum and does not weaken the geologist's argument.
  B: This choice is also irrelevant to the argument about the origin of petroleum and does not weaken the geologist's argument.
  C: This choice actually supports the geologist's argument that it would take millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: This choice is also irrelevant to the argument about the origin of petroleum and does not weaken the geologist's argument.
  E: This choice weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting that some carbon deposits may have formed from non-living sources, which would explain the presence of carbon in petroleum without the need for it to come from living organisms.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The geologist argues that the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence of biomarkers.
- To weaken the geologist's argument, we need a statement that indicates the presence of biomarkers does not necessarily refute the theory of petroleum formation from deep carbon deposits.

Action: Answer("E")
Explanation: 
- Choice E weakens the argument by suggesting that the presence of biomarkers does not necessarily mean that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals. It suggests that some carbon deposits were actually formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which would account for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The geologist is arguing that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust.
  Scientists have challenged this view, suggesting that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist refutes this theory by arguing that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates the past or present existence of a living organism.
  
A: This weakens the geologist's argument for the dominance of the view that petroleum comes from fossilized remains of plants and animals, but it doesn't weaken their argument against the alternative view that petroleum comes from deep carbon deposits.
B: This statement is irrelevant to the geologist's argument.
C: This statement supports the geologist's argument.
D: This statement is also irrelevant to the geologist's argument.
E: This statement weakens the argument that petroleum always comes from the fossilized remains of plants and animals because it provides evidence that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, but it does not directly address the possibility of petroleum forming from deep carbon deposits.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust.
- Some scientists challenge this view, and instead argue that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
- The presence of biomarkers in petroleum is used as evidence for the geologist's view, as biomarkers indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.

Analysis:
- We are looking for the answer choice that weakens the geologist's argument.
- The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
- The presence of biomarkers in petroleum is used as evidence for the geologist's view.
- Therefore, an answer that weakens the link between biomarkers and the fossilized remains of plants and animals would weaken the geologist's argument.

Action: Answer("A")
Choice A suggests that fossils can exist without biomarkers. This weakens the argument that biomarkers in petroleum prove that it is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that petroleum is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals, and this view is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: This weakens the alternative view that petroleum is formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth, but it does not weaken the geologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the geologist's argument.
  C: This statement supports the geologist's argument that it would take a long time for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the geologist's argument.
  E: This is a statement supporting the alternative view about petroleum formation.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the view that it formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals. 
  A: The discovery of fossils that are devoid of biomarkers might suggest that not all fossils have biomarkers, but it does not weaken the geologist's argument.
  B: The fact that living organisms emerged long after the earth's formation is irrelevant to the argument.
  C: The time period for organisms to become petroleum might support the alternative view that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth, but it does not weaken the geologist's argument.
  D: The fact that certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust does not weaken the geologist's argument.
  E: The fact that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants supports the geologist's argument that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: This weakens the geologist's argument, as it suggests that not all fossils contain biomarkers and therefore it is possible that petroleum could have formed from fossils without biomarkers.
  B: This statement is true but it does not have any clear bearing on the geologist's argument.
  C: This statement supports the geologist's argument, as it suggests that it would take a long time for organisms to become petroleum, which is consistent with the idea that petroleum formed from fossilized remains.
  D: This statement is interesting but it does not have any clear bearing on the geologist's argument.
  E: This statement does not weaken the geologist's argument, as it suggests that some carbon deposits could have formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which is consistent with the dominant view that petroleum formed from fossilized remains.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist claims that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum proves that it was formed from the remains of living organisms.
  A: If fossils without biomarkers exist, it doesn't necessarily mean petroleum couldn't have been formed from living organisms. 
  B: This statement doesn't address the argument for or against the formation of petroleum from living organisms.
  C: This statement supports the geologist's argument, as it suggests that it would take a long time for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: This statement doesn't address the argument for or against the formation of petroleum from living organisms.
  E: This statement weakens the geologist's argument, as it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, not living organisms.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The geologist claims that petroleum could not have formed from deep carbon deposits because biomarkers have been found in petroleum, which is an indication of the presence of living organisms.
  A: This choice is irrelevant. It does not address the geologist's argument.
  B: This choice, even if true, does not invalidate the geologist's argument.
  C: This choice supports the geologist's argument, as it suggests that it would take a long time for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: This choice is also irrelevant. It does not weaken or support the geologist's argument.
  E: This choice weakens the argument of the geologist because it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which is a source of biomarkers.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The geologist argues that petroleum is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals because of the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: If fossils were devoid of biomarkers, it would support the alternative theory that petroleum forms from deep carbon deposits since no biomarkers would be present in the fossils to be turned into petroleum. This would weaken the geologist's argument.
  B: The emergence of living organisms has no bearing on the argument as it is not about the emergence of living organisms.
  C: The time it takes for organisms to become petroleum is not relevant to the argument.
  D: The presence of certain strains of bacteria thriving deep inside the earth's crust does not weaken the argument.
  E: This answer choice actually supports the geologist's argument since it states that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants which is what the geologist is arguing.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: City leader: If our city adopts the new tourism plan, the amount of money that tourists spend here annually will increase by at least $2 billion, creating as many jobs as a new automobile manufacturing plant would. It would be reasonable for the city to spend the amount of money necessary to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant here, but adopting the tourism plan would cost less.
Question: The city leader's statements, if true, provide the most support for which one of the following
Choices:
  A: The city should implement the least expensive job creation measures available.
  B: In general, it is reasonable for the city to spend money to try to convince manufacturing companies to build plants in the city.
  C: The city cannot afford both to spend money to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant in the city and to adopt the new tourism plan.
  D: It would be reasonable for the city to adopt the new tourism plan.
  E: The only way the city can create jobs is by increasing tourism.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The student's argument relies on the assumption that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to infection by this microorganism, but this could be flawed for several reasons. For example, the individual might have been infected with the microorganism but not developed symptoms for other reasons, or the individual might have developed symptoms but not recognized them as such.
A: This argument presents a faulty pattern of reasoning known as the fallacy of the undistributed middle. The statement "everything morally right is just" is not equivalent to the statement "only actions that serve the interests of everyone are just."
B: This argument presents a faulty pattern of reasoning known as the fallacy of equivocation. The word "persuade" does not have the same meaning in both instances. Additionally, some writers of fiction do try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
C: This argument presents a faulty pattern of reasoning known as the fallacy of false dilemma. It assumes that there are only two possible outcomes of taking medication: being cured or having symptoms alleviated. However, medication can also have other effects such as slowing the progression of a disease or preventing complications.
D: This argument presents a faulty pattern of reasoning known as the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc. The fact that business expansions have declined after an increase in taxes does not necessarily mean that the taxes caused the decline.
E: This argument presents a faulty pattern of reasoning known as the fallacy of hasty generalization. The fact that doctors wash their hands less often than other health care professionals does not necessarily mean that hand-washing is not effective in preventing disease.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This argument is flawed because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The fact that many people do not develop symptoms does not prove that they are immune to staphylococcus.
  A: This argument is flawed because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.
  B: This argument is flawed because the premise does not necessarily support the conclusion.
  C: This argument is flawed because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.
  D: This argument is flawed because the premise does not necessarily support the conclusion.
  E: This argument is flawed because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The student's argument is based on a flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent. The premise is "If A, then B." The student observes B, and assumes A is true. However, there may be other reasons why B is true that do not involve A. 
  A: This argument is not based on the flawed pattern of reasoning used by the student.
  B: This argument is not based on the flawed pattern of reasoning used by the student.
  C: This argument is based on a flawed pattern of reasoning called denying the antecedent. The premise is "If A, then B." The student observes not A, and assumes not B is true. However, there may be other reasons why B is true even if A is not true. 
  D: This argument is not based on the flawed pattern of reasoning used by the student.
  E: This argument is not based on the flawed pattern of reasoning used by the student.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The student claims that a lack of harmful symptoms indicates immunity to a microorganism, which is not necessarily true.
A: This argument follows the pattern of conflating two concepts that are not equivalent.
B: This argument involves an unsupported assumption about a group of people.
C: This argument involves an unsupported assumption about the nature of medication.
D: This argument involves an unsupported assumption about causation.
E: This argument involves an unsupported assumption about the effectiveness of a procedure.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The student claims that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after exposure to a microorganism, then that person has immunity to that microorganism.
  The student then concludes that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms, they must have an immunity to staphylococcus.
A: This argument is flawed in its pattern of reasoning but is not similar to the student's argument.
  The argument uses a generalization about what is morally right and what serves the interests of everyone to conclude that some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
B: This argument is flawed in its pattern of reasoning but is not similar to the student's argument.
  The argument makes an assumption about the intentions of writers of fiction that is not supported by evidence.
C: This argument is flawed in its pattern of reasoning but is not similar to the student's argument.
  The argument assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
D: This argument is flawed in its pattern of reasoning but is not similar to the student's argument.
  The argument draws a conclusion based on a correlation without considering other factors that may be involved.
E: This argument is flawed in its pattern of reasoning and is similar to the student's argument.
  The argument assumes that if doctors do not wash their hands often, then handwashing cannot be effective in preventing disease.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument assumes that the only reason people do not develop harmful symptoms when exposed to staphylococcus is because they have an immunity to it.
  A: This argument presents the same flawed pattern of reasoning where it assumes that if everything in category A is also in category B, then everything in category B is in category A.
  B: This argument presents the same flawed pattern of reasoning where it assumes that because advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true, then only advertisers try to do so.
  C: This argument presents the same flawed pattern of reasoning where it assumes that if medication is supposed to cure disease or alleviate its symptoms, and Isabel is still ill, then Isabel must not have taken the medication.
  D: This argument presents the same flawed pattern of reasoning where it assumes that if excessive taxation leads to less willingness to expand businesses, then the recent decline in business expansions must be due to excessive taxation.

  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that a group of people who are not advertisers never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures diseases or alleviates symptoms, which is not always true.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between excessive taxation and a decline in business expansions, which may not be the only reason for the decline.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors washing their hands less often than other health care professionals means that hand-washing is not effective in preventing disease, which is not a valid conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that because many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because the fact that someone does not develop harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean that they have an immunity to the microorganism.
  A: This argument is flawed because it equates moral rightness with serving the interests of everyone, which are not necessarily the same thing.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures or alleviates the symptoms of a disease.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that high taxes are the only reason why business owners might be less willing to expand their businesses.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors are the only health care professionals who need to wash their hands frequently to prevent disease.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The student is generalizing from the fact that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing symptoms to the conclusion that they have immunity to staphylococcus. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning since many people without immunity to staphylococcus are also exposed to it without developing symptoms.
A: This argument is from moral philosophy and involves the concepts of justice and best interests. It is not similar to the student's argument in pattern of reasoning.
B: This argument is about the persuasive intent of advertisers and writers of fiction. It is not similar to the student's argument in pattern of reasoning.
C: This argument is about the relationship between medication and disease, and the conclusion is based on an obviously false premise. It is not similar to the student's argument in pattern of reasoning.
D: This argument is about the effect of excessive taxation on business expansion, and the conclusion is based on a correlation that may not imply causation. It is not similar to the student's argument in pattern of reasoning.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book about the drug's side effect does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims, because the physician who criticized the book is employed by the company that manufactures the drug and hence may have personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
A: This option criticizes the journalist's argument for not considering the possibility that other claims made in the book may be questionable, but this is irrelevant to the specific argument about the critique not providing legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
B: This option provides a valid criticism of the journalist's argument, because it suggests that the journalist assumes too much about the physician's ability to assess the evidence fairly, on the basis of his affiliation with the drug company.
C: This option suggests a different kind of bias that the author of the book may have, but it does not address the specific argument in question about the legitimacy of the critique of the book's claim about the drug's side effects.
D: This option provides a valid criticism of the journalist's argument, because it suggests that personal biases of the critic may still yield legitimate grounds for denying a claim, contrary to what the journalist assumes.
E: This option suggests that the failure of a critique to provide legitimate grounds for rejecting a claim need not be explained by personal biases, but it is not a direct criticism of the journalist's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The journalist claims that the physician criticizing the book, who is employed by the company that manufactures the drug, is probably biased and hence the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
 
A: This choice criticizes the journalist's argument for not addressing other claims made in the book, whereas the journalist's argument only focuses on the critique of the book's claim about the drug's side effects.
B: This choice criticizes the journalist's argument for taking for granted that anyone associated with the drug company is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning the drug's side effects, which is not what the journalist is doing. Rather, the journalist is claiming that the physician critiquing the book is biased because of his employment with the company and hence has personal reasons to deny the claim.
C: This choice suggests that the author of the book may be biased, whereas the journalist's argument is focused on the physician who provided the critique.
D: This choice is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument, which claims that the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician has personal reasons to deny the claim. However, it does not present a fatal flaw in the journalist's argument.
E: This choice does not address the claims made in the journalist's argument about the physician's potential bias. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The journalist argues that the physician's criticism of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the claim that the new drug has dangerous side effects because the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug and has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. 
A: This option is not a criticism of the journalist's argument, but rather a separate possibility that is not addressed in the argument.
B: This option is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument because it questions the assumption that anyone associated with a drug company cannot be impartial.
C: This option is not a criticism of the journalist's argument, but rather a possibility about the author of the book that is not addressed in the argument.
D: This option is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument because it questions the assumption that bias necessarily undermines the legitimacy of an argument.
E: This option is not a criticism of the journalist's argument, but rather a separate possibility that is not addressed in the argument.

  The journalist's argument claims that the physician's critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
A: This option is not a criticism of the journalist's argument. It talks about a possibility that the argument does not address, but it does not provide a reason why the journalist's argument is vulnerable to criticism.
B: This option is a criticism of the journalist's argument. The journalist's argument assumes that the physician is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning the drug. However, this assumption may not always be true, and therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism on this ground.
C: This option is not a criticism of the journalist's argument. It talks about a possibility that the argument does not address, but it does not provide a reason why the journalist's argument is vulnerable to criticism.
D: This option is not a criticism of the journalist's argument. It talks about a possibility that the argument does not address, but it does not provide a reason why the journalist's argument is vulnerable to criticism.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician who criticized the book is employed by the company that manufactures that drug and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
  
A: This criticism is not relevant to the journalist's argument because it talks about other claims made in the book, which are not related to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: This is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument because the argument assumes that the physician is biased because of his association with the drug company. The argument does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
  C: This criticism does not apply to the journalist's argument because the argument assumes that the physician is biased, not the author of the book.
  D: This is the correct criticism of the journalist's argument because it suggests that even if someone has personal reasons to deny a claim, they may still provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim. The journalist's argument assumes that the physician's critique is not legitimate because of his association with the drug company.
  E: This criticism is not relevant to the journalist's argument because it talks about the possibility that the failure of the critique to provide legitimate grounds for rejecting the claim is not the result of personal biases of the author.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The evolution of the anatomically modern human brain required a high-calorie diet with adequate fats, which was abundant and reliable in shore environments.
  The human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
A: This choice does not address the apparent conflict presented above.
B: This choice does not address the apparent conflict presented above.
C: This choice does not address the apparent conflict presented above.
D: This choice does not address the apparent conflict presented above.
E: If gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments, then this could explain why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas, even though food resources that could support the high-calorie diet required for brain evolution were most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a significant part of which happened in savanna and woodland areas, despite the fact that the food resources that could support the high-calorie diet required for this process were more abundant and reliable in shore environments.
  A: This option provides information about the metabolic rate of early humans, but it does not relate to the conflict presented in the passage.
  B: This option provides information about the size of early human brains, but it does not relate to the conflict presented in the passage.
  C: This option provides information about the reliability of resources in prehistoric areas, but it does not relate to the conflict presented in the passage.
  D: This option provides information about the exploration of prehistoric shore sites, but it does not relate to the conflict presented in the passage.

This information would help explain why the evolution of the human brain took place in savanna and woodland areas rather than in shore environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage states that early humans required a high-calorie diet rich in fats for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain. The most abundant resources that could support such a diet were found in shore environments, yet the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.

A: This statement, even if true, does not address the apparent conflict presented in the passage. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

B: This statement may explain why early humans did not evolve larger brains, but it does not explain why the evolution of the modern human brain took place away from shore environments. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

C: This option suggests that the resources in savanna and woodland areas were more abundant and reliable than they are today, but the passage does not mention anything about how the reliability and abundance of resources in the savanna and woodland areas have changed over time. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

D: This option suggests a reason why shore environments have not been explored as extensively as savanna and woodland areas for signs of early human habitation, but it does not explain why early human brain evolution occurred away from shore environments. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

E: This statement suggests that gathering food in shore environments required more calories than other environments. Therefore, it provides a possible explanation for why early human brain evolution did not occur in shore environments, even though they had the most abundant and reliable resources for the high-calorie diet required for the evolution of the modern human brain.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The evolution of the anatomically modern human brain required a high-calorie diet that was abundant in fats.
- This type of diet was most available in shore environments where food resources were abundant and reliable.
- However, the human brain's evolution took place mostly in savanna and woodland areas.
- There is a conflict between the above two statements.

Analysis:
- The conflict in the above statements is why the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas despite the fact that the shore environments had abundant and reliable food resources that could support the high-calorie diet required for the evolution of the brain.
- To resolve this conflict, we need to find an option that explains why the savanna and woodland areas were more suitable for the evolution of the human brain than the shore environments.

Answer:
Action: Answer("E")
Explanation: 
- The option E explains that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
- This suggests that early humans would have had to work harder to obtain the high-calorie diet they needed in shore environments, which may have made it less practical as a long-term food source.
- This helps to resolve the apparent conflict presented above and explains why early humans may have evolved their brains in savanna and woodland areas instead of shore environments.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The question presents an apparent conflict between two facts: (1) a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was necessary for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain, and (2) such a diet was most abundant and reliable in shore environments, yet the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  A: This fact does not help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above because it does not provide any information on the availability of food resources in different environments.
  B: This fact is interesting, but it does not help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above.
  C: This fact does not help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above because it contradicts the premise that food resources were more abundant and reliable in shore environments for early humans.
  D: This fact does not help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above because it is not related to the availability of food resources in different environments.
  E: This fact helps to resolve the apparent conflict presented above because it suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in savanna and woodland areas. Thus, the availability of high-calorie food resources in shore environments may have been offset by the higher caloric cost of gathering them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The study found that among office workers who do similar amounts of typing, those who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
A: This choice does not help to explain the study's finding because it is about workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. 
B: This choice focuses on emotional stress, which is not directly related to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. 
C: This choice is not relevant because it describes the keyboards on which office workers type. 
D: This choice is not relevant because it is about office workers who rarely use keyboards. 
E: This choice provides a possible explanation for the study's findings, as it suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work, which may reduce their risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. 

Action: Answer("E")

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome compared to those who reported the most control. 
A: This option talks about the amount of typing done by workers who have the least and most control over their own work. This may be a factor that influences the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, but it does not help explain the study's findings.
B: This option suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work can lead to emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This provides a possible explanation for the study's findings.
C: This option suggests that keyboards on which office workers type may contribute to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. While this may be true, it does not help explain the study's findings about the relationship between control over one's own work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
D: This option talks about the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome among office workers who rarely use keyboards and their sense of control over their own work. This is not relevant to the study's findings about the relationship between control over one's own work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
E: This option talks about repetitive motions other than typing that may be performed by office workers who have the most and least control over their own work. This may be a factor that influences the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, but it does not help explain the study's findings.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control. 
  A: This choice might weaken the study's findings as it claims that office workers with most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than those who have the least control, possibly indicating that the amount of typing has a more direct correlation with developing carpal tunnel syndrome than control.
  B: This choice offers a possible explanation of how feeling a lack of control over one's own work could lead to nerve disorders, but it is not directly related to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  C: This choice is a possible explanation of how the physical characteristics of keyboards could lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, but it doesn't address the relationship between control over work and the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This choice is unrelated to the use of keyboards and typing, so it is not a relevant explanation for the relationship between control over work and the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  E: This choice might weaken the study's findings as it indicates that office workers with most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than those who have the least control, possibly indicating that the correlation between control and the development of carpal tunnel syndrome is not related to typing but to other repetitive motions.
Action: Answer("None of the above")

Knowledge:
  The study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
A: This answer choice suggests that those with the most control over their own work type less than those with the least control over their own work. This does not explain why those with the least control had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
B: This answer choice suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This explanation would support the study's findings, as emotional stress might lead to a higher likelihood of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
C: This answer choice suggests that the keyboards themselves put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This does not explain why those with the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
D: This answer choice does not explain why those with the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control. It also doesn't address the issue of typing or repetitive motions, which are mentioned in the passage.
E: This answer choice suggests that those with the most control over their own work perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This might explain why those with the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control, as those workers might be typing more often than workers with more control.

Knowledge: 
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  
A: This option does not help explain the study's findings, because it is irrelevant how much typing is done by workers who have the most control over their own work.
B: This option may explain how a lack of control promotes stress, but it does not explain the link between lack of control and carpal tunnel syndrome.
C: This option is irrelevant, as it only talks about the keyboards and not the relationship between control over one's work and carpal tunnel syndrome.
D: This option actually weakens the study's findings as it contradicts the study's claim that workers reporting the least control over their work have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
E: This option may help explain the study's findings, since office workers with the most control over their work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often and may thus be less susceptible to developing carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The author is using a pattern of reasoning where Wells, an expert in the concert industry, believes that the concert should have sold out if it was properly promoted. Since it did not sell out, Wells believes that it was probably not properly promoted.

A: Dr. Smith believes that the heart transplant would have been successful if performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Since the patient did not survive, Dr. Smith believes that it was probably not properly performed.
B: Professor Willis believes that the sample should contain organic compounds. Since it does not, Professor Willis believes that it is probably not labeled correctly.
C: The neighbor believes that the wall should not show any signs of damage if it was properly repaired. Since there are still signs of damage, the neighbor believes that it was probably not properly repaired.
D: The builder believes that the roof would not require repairs for years unless it is damaged in a storm. However, the roof is already leaking without any storms. Therefore, the builder was probably wrong.
E: Professor Yanakita believes that the tests will find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. Since the tests did find lead in the soil, Professor Yanakita believes that they were probably properly conducted.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, thought that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. The concert did not sell out. 
A: This argument uses a similar structure with a condition and a prediction. Dr. Smith predicts that the patient would survive if the surgery is performed by a highly skilled surgeon. The patient did not survive the surgery. 
B: This argument also uses a similar structure with a condition and a prediction. Professor Willis predicts that the sample would contain organic compounds if it were labeled correctly. The sample does not contain any organic compounds. 
C: This argument uses a similar structure with a condition and a prediction. The neighbor predicts that the repair would not be noticeable if it were properly done. The damage to the wall is still noticeable. 
D: This argument does not use a similar structure. The builder predicts that the roof would not require repairs unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. 
E: This argument does not use a similar structure. Professor Yanakita predicts that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. The tests did find lead in the soil. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about a certain event, and then concludes that if that event did not occur, then the reason for it is the opposite of what was predicted.
  A: The reasoning here is different from the argument above. The argument above is based on the assumption that if a knowledgeable person makes a prediction, and that prediction doesn't come true, then the opposite must be true. In this case, the reasoning is based on the assumption that if a skilled surgeon performs the transplant, the patient will survive. Therefore, the reasoning is not similar to the argument above.
  B: The reasoning here is also different from the argument above. The argument above presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person makes a prediction based on certain conditions, and then concludes that the opposite is true if those conditions are not met. In this case, the reasoning is based on the assumption that if the sample is labeled correctly, it must contain organic compounds. Therefore, the reasoning is not similar to the argument above.
  C: The reasoning here is different from the argument above. The argument above presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person predicts a certain outcome, and then concludes that the opposite is true if that outcome does not occur. In this case, the reasoning is based on the assumption that if the repair is done properly, the damage will not be noticeable. Therefore, the reasoning is not similar to the argument above.
  D: The reasoning here is somewhat similar to the argument above, but it is not the best match. The argument above presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person makes a prediction, and then concludes that the opposite is true if that prediction does not come true. In this case, the builder predicts that the roof will not require repairs unless it is damaged in a storm. The fact that the roof is leaking suggests that the builder was wrong, but it does not necessarily mean that the opposite is true. Therefore, the reasoning is not the best match.
  E: The reasoning here is different from the argument above. The argument above presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person makes a prediction, and then concludes that the opposite is true if that prediction does not come true. In this case, the reasoning is based on the assumption that if the tests are conducted properly, they will find lead in the soil. The fact that the tests did find lead in the soil suggests that they were conducted properly, but it does not necessarily mean that the opposite is true. Therefore, the reasoning is not the best match.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning where a knowledgeable person makes a prediction that something will happen unless something goes wrong, and then concludes that because the predicted outcome did not happen, it must have gone wrong.
  A: The argument in option A presents a pattern of reasoning where a knowledgeable person makes a prediction that something will happen if something is done correctly, and then concludes that because the predicted outcome did not happen, it must not have been done correctly.
  B: The argument in option B presents a pattern of reasoning where a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about what a sample contains, and then concludes that the sample must be labeled incorrectly because it does not contain what was predicted.
  C: The argument in option C presents a pattern of reasoning where a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about how well a repair will be done, and then concludes that the repair must not have been done well because the predicted outcome did not happen.
  D: The argument in option D presents a pattern of reasoning where a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about when something will happen, and then concludes that the prediction was probably wrong because the thing happened earlier than predicted.
  E: The argument in option E presents a pattern of reasoning where a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about what will be found if certain tests are done correctly, and then concludes that the tests were probably done correctly because the predicted outcome happened.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning that involves making a prediction based on an expert's knowledge, and then drawing a conclusion based on evidence that contradicts that prediction.
A: This argument presents a pattern of reasoning that involves making a prediction based on an expert's knowledge, and then drawing a conclusion based on evidence that contradicts that prediction, similar to the argument above.
B: This argument presents a pattern of reasoning that involves drawing a conclusion from an expert's knowledge, but there is no prediction involved, so it is not similar to the argument above.
C: This argument presents a pattern of reasoning that involves making a prediction based on an expert's knowledge, but the evidence provided does not contradict the prediction, so it is not similar to the argument above.
D: This argument presents a pattern of reasoning that involves making a prediction based on an expert's knowledge, but there is no evidence provided to contradict the prediction, so it is not similar to the argument above.
E: This argument presents a pattern of reasoning that involves drawing a conclusion from an expert's knowledge, but there is no prediction involved, so it is not similar to the argument above.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument points out that Wells, who has knowledge about the concert business, was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted, but it did not sell out, suggesting that it was probably not properly promoted.
A: The argument concludes that the surgery was probably not properly performed because the patient did not survive, even though Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon.
B: The argument concludes that the sample is probably not labeled correctly because Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that it probably did not contain any organic compounds.
C: The argument concludes that the repair to the wall was probably not properly done because the neighbor, an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired, but it still is noticeable.
D: The argument concludes that the builder was probably wrong about the roof not requiring repairs for years because the roof is already leaking, even though there have been no major storms.
E: The argument concludes that the tests were probably properly conducted because Professor Yanakita, an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted, and the tests did find lead in the soil.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument states that Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. The concert did not sell out, so Wells concludes that it was probably not properly promoted.

A: The argument states that a cardiologist said a patient would probably survive a heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. The patient did not survive the surgery, so the cardiologist concludes that it probably was not properly performed. This is similar to the given argument because both involve drawing a negative conclusion based on an expected positive outcome not being achieved.

B: The argument states that a chemistry professor said a sample probably did not contain organic compounds. The sample did not contain organic compounds, so the professor concludes that the sample is probably not labeled correctly. This is not similar to the given argument as it involves drawing a conclusion about the labeling of a sample based on the lack of organic compounds, not on an expected positive outcome not being achieved.

C: The argument states that a neighbor said damage to a wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. The damage is noticeable, so the neighbor concludes that the repair was not properly done. This is similar to the given argument because both involve drawing a negative conclusion based on an expected positive outcome not being achieved.

D: The argument states that a builder said a school's roof would not require repairs for years unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is leaking, so the argument concludes that the builder was probably wrong. This is not similar to the given argument because it involves drawing a conclusion about the builder's prediction based on a negative outcome being observed, not on an expected positive outcome not being achieved.

E: The argument states that a professor said tests would find lead in the soil if properly conducted. The tests did find lead in the soil, so the argument concludes that the tests were probably properly conducted. This is not similar to the given argument because it involves drawing a conclusion about the tests being properly conducted based on a positive outcome being observed.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument presents a person's belief that a certain event should have a certain result, and since it did not have that result, the person concludes that a certain condition was not met. The conclusion is drawn from the premise that the person believed that the event would have a certain result if the condition was met.
A: The argument presents a person's belief that a certain event should have a certain result, and since it did not have that result, the person concludes that a certain condition was not met. The conclusion is drawn from the premise that the person believed that the event would have a certain result if the condition was met.
B: The argument presents a person's belief that a certain sample should have a certain content, and since it does not have that content, the person concludes that a certain condition was not met. The conclusion is drawn from the premise that the person believed that the sample would have a certain content if the condition was met.
C: The argument presents a person's belief that a certain repair should have a certain effect, and since it did not have that effect, the person concludes that a certain condition was not met. The conclusion is drawn from the premise that the person believed that the repair would have a certain effect if the condition was met.
D: The argument presents a person's belief that a certain roof should last a certain amount of time without repairs, and since it did not last that long, the person concludes that a certain condition was not met. The conclusion is drawn from the premise that the person believed that the roof would last a certain amount of time without repairs if the condition was met.
E: The argument presents a person's belief that a certain test should have a certain result, and since it did have that result, the person concludes that a certain condition was met. The conclusion is drawn from the premise that the person believed that the test would have a certain result if the condition was met.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which someone makes a prediction, based on their expertise, about what will happen under certain conditions.

Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that walking upright is a natural and instinctive behavior in Kodiak bears, based on the shape of their hip and foot bones. It implies that this behavior is innate and not learned through experience.
A: This does not seem to be a vulnerability because the argument does not claim that all Kodiak bears walk on hind legs, but rather that it is a natural and instinctive behavior for them.
B: This could be a vulnerability because the argument assumes that walking on hind legs is innate, without considering the possibility that it could be learned or a combination of both innate and learned behavior.
C: This does not seem to be a vulnerability because the term 'behavior' is used consistently throughout the argument.

D: This statement is a possible explanation for the discrepancy in physicians' opinions about the influence of drug companies' gifts.
E: The statement is not supported by the given information about the survey results.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts. 
Choices:
  A: The survey does not provide information about the relationship between accepting gifts and prescribing unnecessary drugs, so this cannot be concluded.
  B: The survey does not indicate that most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines, so this cannot be concluded.
  C: This choice is supported by the survey results. If most physicians believe that their own choices are not influenced by gifts, but most other physicians' choices are influenced, then some physicians must be mistaken about one or both of these beliefs.
  D: The survey does not provide information about physicians who admit that their own choices are influenced by gifts, so this cannot be concluded.
  E: The survey does not provide information about all physicians who admit that their own choices are influenced by gifts, so this cannot be concluded.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. But the same survey shows that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  
A: The passage does not provide information to support or reject this choice.
B: The passage does not suggest whether physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines.
C: This choice accurately reflects the survey results mentioned in the passage.
D: The passage does not provide information to support or reject this choice.
E: The passage does not support or reject this choice.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The survey shows that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Choices:
  A: The survey only provides information about the perceptions of most physicians about the influence of drug companies' gifts on their prescription choices and those of their colleagues. It does not provide evidence for whether those who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts. This information cannot be inferred from the survey results.
  B: The survey does not provide evidence for whether most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians. This information is not relevant to the survey results.
  C: This choice accurately reflects a possible conclusion that can be drawn from the survey results. If most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts, then some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  D: The survey does not provide evidence for whether some physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts. This information cannot be inferred from the survey results.
  E: The survey only provides evidence that most physicians who believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts also believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts. This choice goes further by making a blanket statement that all physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts. This information cannot be inferred from the survey results.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The survey found that most physicians believe that their own prescription choices are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  - The same survey found that most physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  
A: There is no information in the passage to support this statement.
B: There is no information in the passage to support this statement.
C: This statement is consistent with the survey results.
D: This statement is not necessarily true based on the survey results.
E: This statement is not necessarily true based on the survey results.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- A survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.

Action: Answer("C")
According to the survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts. Therefore, it is possible that some physicians are mistaken about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians. Thus, Choice C must be true. None of the other choices can be logically deduced from the given information.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  
A: It is not clear whether physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts, based on the survey results.
B: The survey does not provide evidence for whether most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians.
C: This statement is consistent with the survey results, which suggest that some physicians are mistaken about the influence of drug companies' gifts on their own and other physicians' prescribing choices.
D: This statement is consistent with the survey results, which suggest that some physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts.
E: The survey does not provide evidence that all physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The survey results indicate that most physicians do not believe their own choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Choices:
  A: The survey does not provide any information to support this statement, so this choice cannot be the correct answer.
  B: The survey does not mention any position taken by physicians with respect to new guidelines for regulating drug companies' practices in sending gifts to physicians.
  C: This statement correctly reflects the survey results and is a possible conclusion based on the information provided.
  D: This statement is not supported by the survey results. The survey indicates that physicians who admit their own choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts also believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  E: The survey results indicate that most physicians do not believe their own choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts, but it does not provide information about what physicians who admit such influence believe about other physicians' prescription choices.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  According to the survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Choices:
  A: This statement is not necessarily true based on the information given in the survey. 
  B: The survey does not provide information on whether physicians believe drug companies should adopt new guidelines.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the dinosaur from raising its neck to browse high-growing vegetation, but that it could bend downward, allowing it to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This statement is not necessary, as the argument provides an alternative way that Diplodocus could access vegetation.
  E: This answer is relevant to the argument because it addresses a possible alternative method of accessing vegetation that might undermine the conclusion that Diplodocus fed on plants on or near the ground or underwater. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that computer models have shown that Diplodocus neck could not raise to reach high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves and that the neck structure would have allowed downward bending and extension below ground level, enabling the dinosaur to feed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: This statement is not required for the argument to hold. The argument is based on the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones and not on modern ground-feeding animals.
B: This statement is also not required for the argument to hold. The argument is not concerned with Diplodocus's visual ability or how it angled its head.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument and is not required.
D: This statement is also not required. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land.
E: This statement is relevant to the argument. If Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then the argument would be weakened.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the feeding habits of the dinosaur Diplodocus and how computer models have shown that its neck structure would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation. Rather, its neck could bend downward and extend below ground level, allowing it to access underwater vegetation from dry land. 
A: This statement is not necessary to the argument and is not discussed in the passage. 
B: This statement is also not necessary to the argument and is not discussed in the passage. 
C: This statement is not mentioned or implied in the argument. 
D: This statement is not necessary to the argument because the passage explains how Diplodocus accessed underwater vegetation, rendering this choice irrelevant. 
E: This statement is necessary to the argument because it rules out another way in which Diplodocus could have accessed underwater vegetation. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument explains that Diplodocus would not have been able to raise its neck to access high-growing vegetation and that it would have been able to bend it downward and extend it to reach underwater vegetation from dry land. 

A: This statement is not relevant to the argument being made.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument being made.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument being made.
D: This statement is not necessary because the argument is not based on whether or not Diplodocus had other ways of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: This statement is relevant to the argument because if Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then it would not necessarily have to feed on plants on or near the ground. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument discusses how the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would not allow it to raise its neck to browse on high-growing vegetation.
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus was able to bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level, allowing it to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  
Assumption:
  The argument implies that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater if it had an inability to raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage explains that computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented neck raising. It is also explained that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and even extend it below ground level, allowing access to underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: This statement is irrelevant as the argument is not about modern animals.
B: This statement is also irrelevant as the argument is not about Diplodocus's vision.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument, which is focused on the structure of Diplodocus's neck and how that limited its ability to feed.
D: This statement is not assumed by the argument, which provides an alternative way that Diplodocus could access high-growing vegetation.
E: This statement is assumed by the argument because it rules out another possible way that Diplodocus could have accessed underwater vegetation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument claims that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the dinosaur from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but that the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing it to access underwater vegetation from dry land. The conclusion is that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. 

Analysis: The assumption required by the argument is an unstated premise that must be true in order for the argument to hold. It should be something that connects the evidence to the conclusion. 

A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. Even if the neck structures of modern ground-feeding animals were similar to Diplodocus, it does not help or hurt the argument.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument. Even if Diplodocus were not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward, it does not help or hurt the argument.
C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. Even if it were impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain, it does not help or hurt the argument.
D: This statement is relevant to the argument, but it is not an assumption required by the argument. The argument is not about whether Diplodocus had other ways of accessing high-growing vegetation, but rather what it was likely to feed on given the structure of its neck bones.
E: This statement is relevant to the argument, but it is not an assumption required by the argument. The argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not consider whether Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument states that Diplodocus fed on plants on or near the ground or underwater due to the structure of its neck bones. It also notes that the neck could bend downwards and extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.

A: This statement is not necessary for the argument, as it does not relate to the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones or its feeding behavior.
B: This statement is not necessary for the argument, as it does not relate to the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones or its feeding behavior.
C: This statement is not necessary for the argument, as it speculates on a different aspect of the dinosaur's physiology that is not related to its feeding behavior or its neck bones.
D: This statement is not necessary for the argument, as it suggests an alternative way that Diplodocus could have accessed high-growing vegetation, but it does not relate to the structure of its neck bones.
E: This statement is a possible assumption required by the argument, as it suggests that Diplodocus could not have browsed for underwater vegetation in other ways, which reinforces the argument's conclusion that Diplodocus fed on plants on or near the ground or underwater.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument is trying to show that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater, rather than browsing for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its neck. 
A: This is not required by the argument.
B: This is not required by the argument.
C: This is not required by the argument.
D: This is also not required by the argument.
E: This might weaken the argument, but it is not required by the argument. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves, but it could bend downward to access underwater vegetation from dry land, suggesting that Diplodocus would have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: The argument does not rely on any assumption related to the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals.
B: The argument does not mention anything related to Diplodocus's vision.
C: The argument does not make any claims about Diplodocus's brain or blood supply.
D: The argument does not make any assumptions about Diplodocus's ways of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: This assumption is related to underwater vegetation, but the argument already states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, it is not necessary.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")  
The flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it relies on anecdotal evidence (everyone I know voted against the proposal) rather than official results, which were based on a larger and more diverse sample. Option A is the best choice because it highlights this issue by pointing out that the sample in question (everyone the speaker knows) is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses evidence from the people the arguer knows, which is a small and biased sample, and assumes that it is representative of the general population. Therefore, it is flawed because it uses a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A describes this flaw accurately. The argument does not presume the truth of the conclusion; it rejects the official results and claims that evidence is rigged. The argument does not attack the proponents of a claim. The argument does not fail to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted. The argument does not defend a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses anecdotal evidence based on the people the person knows as opposed to the actual results of the national referendum. This is an example of a biased sample, which is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Therefore, the person cannot conclude that the official results are wrong based on their personal experience. Choice A describes this flaw accurately. The other choices are not relevant to the given argument.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument commits the fallacy of hasty generalization because it uses a small, biased sample of people to make a general statement about what most people think. It is possible that the people the arguer knows do not represent the larger population. Choice A accurately describes this flaw by pointing out that the sample is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The other answer choices are not directly relevant to the flaw in the argument.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses anecdotal evidence from the author's personal circle of acquaintances to make a generalization about the entire population. This is not a representative sample of the population and therefore cannot be used to make a valid argument about the referendum results. Answer A correctly identifies this as a flaw in the reasoning of the argument. The other answer choices do not accurately describe the flaw in the argument.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses anecdotal evidence from a non-representative sample (people the arguer knows) to refute official results that are likely based on a representative sample. Therefore, the argument commits the fallacy of hasty generalization, which involves drawing a general conclusion based on insufficient or non-representative evidence. Choice A captures this flaw by referring to the non-representative sample the argument uses. The other choices do not accurately capture the flaw in the argument.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses a small sample of people known to the arguer ("everyone I know") to prove that the official results must be rigged. Such a sample, while perhaps valid for some purposes, may be unlikely to be representative of the general population. Therefore, it is possible that most people did indeed vote in favor of the proposal, despite what the arguer's friends' voting behavior may have been. Choice A correctly describes this flaw. Choices B, C, D, and E do not fit the argument.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument presented claims that the official results of the referendum are incorrect, as everyone the person knows voted against the proposal. This is not a representative sample of the population, and there could be many reasons why the people the person knows voted a certain way. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. This is best captured by choice A.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that the official results of the referendum must be rigged because everyone the author knows voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it. 

A: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
C: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: This choice most accurately describes the flaw in the argument. The argument assumes that everyone the author knows is representative of the entire population, which is a false assumption.
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument relies on anecdotal evidence from a small sample of people known to the arguer, rather than the official results of the national referendum. This sample is unlikely to be representative of the general population, so the conclusions drawn from it are unreliable. This represents a clear example of the fallacy of hasty generalization. Therefore, (A) is the most accurate characterization of the flaw in the reasoning of the argument. 

(B) describes the circular reasoning fallacy, which is not present in the argument.
(C) describes the ad hominem fallacy, which is also not present in the argument.
(D) points to a relevant distinction, but it is not the most accurate description of the flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
(E) describes the bandwagon fallacy, which is also not present in the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Inez: The book we are reading, The Nature of Matter, is mistitled. A title should summarize the content of the whole book, but nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy. Antonio: I do not think that the author erred; according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the conversation above?
Choices:
  A: Inez believes that the book should be called The Nature of Energy.
  B: Antonio believes that there are no differences between matter and energy.
  C: Inez and Antonio disagree on whether matter and energy are related.
  D: Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book.
  E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez believes that the book's title is inappropriate because it focuses only on matter, and not energy, which she thinks is equally important.
  Antonio thinks that the book's title is appropriate because matter and energy are related.
  
Reasoning: 
  Inez and Antonio do not disagree about whether matter and energy are related; they agree that matter and energy are related. 
  Inez does not propose a specific alternate title for the book, other than suggesting that any title should reflect the importance of both matter and energy.
  The conversation is primarily about the title of the book, not the overall value of the book.
  Therefore, the most accurate statement is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. 
  
Answer: E
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez argues that the book is mistitled because it discusses both matter and energy, while the title only mentions matter.
  Antonio disagrees with Inez's claim by saying that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning: 
  Inez's argument suggests that the title of the book should mention both matter and energy. 
  Antonio's response does not necessarily contradict Inez's claim, but rather provides an explanation for why the book focuses on both matter and energy. 
  Therefore, the most strongly supported claim in the conversation is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
  
Answer: E
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
Inez claims that the book's title is mistitled because it only mentions matter and not energy, despite the fact that nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing energy. This implies that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Antonio, on the other hand, disagrees with Inez's claim and thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Therefore, options A, B, C, and D can be eliminated. Option E is the most accurate interpretation of Inez's position in the conversation, so the correct answer is E.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

Inez believes that the title should not only mention matter but also energy, whereas Antonio believes that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Therefore, it can be inferred that they both agree that matter and energy are related, which eliminates option C. Moreover, there is no indication that Antonio believes that there are no differences between matter and energy, which eliminates option B. Additionally, there is no evidence of disagreement about the overall value of the book, which eliminates option D. Finally, the conversation does not suggest that Inez believes the book should be called "The Nature of Energy," as she only argues that the book's title should not only mention matter but also energy. Therefore, the most strongly supported choice is E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
Inez argues that the book's title is misleading because it does not mention energy, which is a major topic in the book. She believes that the title should not mention matter without also mentioning energy. Antonio disagrees with Inez's argument and argues that the author did not err because matter and energy are related. Therefore, the most strongly supported option is E, in which Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
- Inez thinks that the book's title is mistitled because it does not accurately summarize the content of the whole book. 
- Inez thinks that the title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
- Antonio disagrees with Inez and argues that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

The answer is not A because while Inez advocates for the inclusion of energy in the title, she does not say that the whole book should be called The Nature of Energy.

The answer is not B because Antonio clearly states that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon, which means that they are not the same.

The answer is not C because while Inez and Antonio have different views on the title of the book, they do agree that matter and energy are related.

The answer is not D because there is no disagreement between Inez and Antonio about the overall value of the book.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez has a problem with the title of the book because it focuses on matter and does not mention energy.
  Antonio disagrees with Inez and thinks that the book's author made no mistake because matter and energy are interrelated concepts.
  
Reasoning:
  Inez thinks that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, and this idea is consistent with her argument that nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing energy. 
  Antonio does not believe that there is an error in the title because he thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Nevertheless, he does not express an opinion against Inez's suggestion that the title should mention energy as well.
  
Therefore, the answer is (E) Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
Inez argues that the title of the book is misleading because it focuses on matter while the book also discusses energy. Antonio counters by saying that matter and energy are closely related. Therefore, the conversation suggests that Inez believes that if the book discusses both matter and energy, then the title should reflect that and not just mention matter. This is best captured by choice E.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez states that the book's title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book.
  Inez claims that nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing a different subject, energy.
  Antonio disagrees with Inez, stating that according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning:
  In this conversation, Inez argues that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, while Antonio believes that matter and energy are related. None of the other options are supported by the conversation.

Answer: E
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  The conversation is about the title of the book, The Nature of Matter, and how it relates to the content of the book.
  Inez argues that the book's title is mistitled because nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing energy, which is not mentioned in the title.
  Antonio argues that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Analysis:
  A: Although Inez believes the book is mistitled and discusses energy, she does not suggest an alternative title about energy.
  B: Antonio does not say that there are no differences between matter and energy. He argues that they are two facets of the same phenomenon.
  C: Antonio and Inez do not disagree on whether matter and energy are related; Antonio actually supports the idea that they are related.
  D: The conversation does not discuss the overall value of the book, only the title and content.
  E: Inez's argument is that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, which is a closely related subject that is discussed in nearly half of the book.

Therefore, "E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy." is the best answer.

  A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
  B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  C: My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house. Since anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it.
  D: My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Since no one who lives in a house both O'WIlS it and pays rent on it, it must be that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their heuse.
  E: Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Therefore, it must be that they pay rent on it.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a conditional statement: if someone received a poor performance evaluation, then they did not receive a raise. The argument uses the contrapositive of this statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement.

  The argument above presents a conditional statement that IF an employee received a poor performance evaluation, THEN they did not receive a raise.
  The argument concludes that since Lester did not receive a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation. This is flawed because there are other reasons why someone could not have received a raise.
  A: This argument presents a conditional statement that IF someone lives in a house, owns it, THEN they do not pay rent on it. The argument concludes that since the neighbors pay rent, they must not own the house. This is sound reasoning and is not flawed like the original argument.
  B: This argument presents a conditional statement that IF someone lives in a house, owns it, THEN they do not pay rent on it. The argument concludes that since the neighbors own the house, they must not pay rent on it. This is flawed reasoning because there are other reasons why someone could own a house and not live in it.
  C: This argument presents a conditional statement that IF someone lives in a house but does not rent it, THEN they own it. The argument concludes that since the neighbors did not pay rent, they must own the house. This is sound reasoning and is not flawed like the original argument.
  D: This argument presents a conditional statement that IF someone lives in a house, owns it, THEN they do not pay rent on it. The argument concludes that since the neighbors do not own the house, they must pay rent on it. This is sound reasoning and is not flawed like the original argument.
  E: This argument presents a conditional statement that IF someone lives in a house but does not own it, THEN they pay rent on it. The argument concludes that since the neighbors do not own the house, they must pay rent on it. This is sound reasoning and is not flawed like the original argument.

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a conditional statement in the form of "If not A, then not B".
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise (not B), then it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation (not A).
  A: This argument presents a conditional statement in the form of "If A, then not B".
  B: This argument presents a conditional statement in the form of "If A, then not B".
  C: This argument presents a conditional statement in the form of "If not B, then A".
  D: This argument presents a conditional statement in the form of "If A, then not B".
  E: This argument presents a conditional statement in the form of "If not A, then B".
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests a conditional relationship between receiving a raise and a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument claims that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  A: This argument presents a similar conditional relationship, but the conclusion is opposite to the one stated in the argument above.
  B: This argument presents a similar conditional relationship, but the conclusion is opposite to the one stated in the argument above.
  C: This argument does not present a conditional relationship similar to the one stated in the argument above.
  D: This argument presents a similar conditional relationship, but the conclusion is opposite to the one stated in the argument above.
  E: This argument presents a similar conditional relationship, and the conclusion is similar to the one stated in the argument above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a conditional statement: if someone works at Leila's Electronics and received a poor performance evaluation, then they did not receive a raise. The argument then uses the contrapositive of the statement: if someone received a raise, they did not receive a poor performance evaluation. The argument then applies this contrapositive to Lester, who did not receive a raise, and concludes that he received a poor performance evaluation.
  A: The argument presents a conditional statement, but the reasoning is different. This argument concludes that the neighbors do not own their house because they pay rent on it. However, the fact that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it is not presented as a conditional statement. 
  B: This argument presents a conditional statement: if someone lives in a house and both owns it and pays rent on it, then they cannot be my neighbor. The argument then uses the contrapositive of the statement: if someone is my neighbor, then they do not both own their house and pay rent on it. The argument then concludes that the neighbors do not pay rent on their house because they own it. The flawed reasoning here is similar to the original argument because it applies the contrapositive of a conditional statement to draw a conclusion.
  C: The argument presents a conditional statement: if someone lives in a house but does not rent it, then they own it. The argument then concludes that the neighbors own their house because they have not paid any rent on it. However, the argument does not provide evidence that the neighbors actually live in the house. 
  D: The argument presents a conditional statement: if someone lives in a house and both owns it and pays rent on it, then they cannot be my neighbors. The argument then uses the contrapositive of the statement: if someone is my neighbor, then they do not both own their house and pay rent on it. The argument then concludes that the neighbors pay rent on their house because they do not own it. The flawed reasoning here is similar to the original argument because it applies the contrapositive of a conditional statement to draw a conclusion.
  E: This argument concludes that the neighbors pay rent on their house because they do not own it. The argument does not present a conditional statement, so the flawed reasoning here is not similar to the original argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The argument presents a conditional statement of the form "If A, then B".
- The argument then observes "Not B", and concludes "Not A".
- This is an example of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.

A: This argument uses the same conditional statement structure, but the conclusion is different. The argument concludes "Not A" instead of "Not B". This is an example of an argument that uses the wrong direction of reasoning.
B: This argument uses a similar conditional statement structure, but the conclusion is different. The argument concludes "Not B" instead of "Not A". This is an example of an argument that uses the wrong direction of reasoning.
C: This argument does not use a conditional statement structure, so it is not similar to the original argument.
D: This argument uses the same conditional statement structure, but the conclusion is different. The argument concludes "B" instead of "Not A". This is an example of an argument that uses the wrong direction of reasoning.
E: This argument uses a similar conditional statement structure, and the conclusion is the same. This is an example of an argument that uses the same pattern of reasoning as the original argument.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument presents a conditional "If not A, then not B" as "No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise." and "Lester has not received a raise." and concludes that "it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation."
A: The argument uses the same structure of "If not A, then not B". However, the negation of the consequent would not lead to the negation of the antecedent, so it is not similar to the argument in question.
B: The argument uses the same structure of "If not A, then not B". However, the argument concludes the opposite of the negation of the antecedent, so it is not similar to the argument in question.
C: The argument presents a conditional "If A, then B" as "anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it" and "My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house." and concludes that "it must be that they own it." This argument is not the same structure as the argument in question.
D: The argument uses the same structure of "If not A, then not B". However, the argument concludes the opposite of the negation of the antecedent, so it is not similar to the argument in question.
E: The argument presents a conditional "If A, then B" as "Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it." and "My next-door neighbors do not own their house." and concludes that "it must be that they pay rent on it." This argument uses the same structure as the argument in question.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument concludes that Lester has received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise, assuming that everyone who gets a poor performance evaluation does not get a raise.
  A: The argument concludes that the next-door neighbors do not own their house because they pay rent, assuming that everyone who owns a house does not pay rent on it.
  B: This argument concludes that the next-door neighbors pay rent on their house because they own it, which is the opposite of the conclusion of the argument in the prompt.
  C: This argument concludes that the neighbors own their house because they have not paid any rent, assuming that anyone who does not pay rent on a house must own it.
  D: This argument concludes that the next-door neighbors pay rent on their house because they do not own it, which is the opposite of the conclusion of the argument in the prompt.
  E: This argument concludes that the next-door neighbors pay rent on their house because they do not own it, assuming that anyone who does not own a house must pay rent on it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is flawed because it assumes that not receiving a raise implies receiving a poor performance evaluation without considering other possible reasons for not receiving a raise. 
  A: This argument is flawed for the same reason as the original argument. It assumes that paying rent on a house implies not owning it, without considering other possible reasons for paying rent.
  B: This argument is also flawed for the same reason as the original argument. It assumes that owning a house implies not paying rent on it, without considering other possible reasons for owning a house.
  C: This argument assumes that not paying rent on a house implies owning it without considering other possible reasons for not paying rent.
  D: This argument assumes that paying rent on a house implies not owning it without considering other possible reasons for paying rent.
  E: This argument is flawed for the same reason as the original argument. It assumes that not owning a house implies paying rent on it, without considering other possible reasons for not owning a house.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: For a contract to be valid, an offer must be legitimate and accepted by the other party. An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
A: The argument is valid since it states that for a contract to be valid, a legitimate offer must be made and accepted by the other party.
B: The argument is valid since it states that an offer made in jest is not legitimate and thus, the contract would not be valid.
C: The argument is not valid since it assumes that the offer was legitimate just because it was made.
D: The argument is valid since it states that for a contract to be valid, the offer must be made in such a way that the other party would reasonably believe it to be legitimate.
E: The argument is not valid because it assumes that the offer was not legitimate without providing any evidence to support that claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

A: The argument states that if Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer, there was a valid contract. The principle about legitimate offers is relevant, but the argument is incomplete without any information about Sandy's perception of the offer.
B: The argument states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus made the offer in jest, which means that the contract was not valid. This is in line with the principle about legitimate offers. 
C: The argument states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate and that if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. This argument does not consider Mindy's perception of the offer and is unrelated to the principle about legitimate offers.
D: The argument states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. This argument is in line with the principle about legitimate offers.
E: The argument states that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. The argument does not consider whether Veronica reasonably believed the offer to be made in jest, which is the focus of the principle about legitimate offers. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The principle mentioned in the context states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest. A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other.
A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract. - This argument is not justified by the principle stated in the context, as the argument does not deal with the legitimacy of the offer.
B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. - This argument is justified by the principle stated in the context, as the offer was not legitimate.
C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. - This argument does not deal with the legitimacy of the offer. It assumes that the offer is legitimate.
D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. - This argument is justified by the principle stated in the context, as the offer was legitimate and not made in jest.
E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. - This argument is justified by the principle stated in the context, as the offer was not legitimate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The principle stated in the context is about the validity of a contract.
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. This statement is consistent with the principle stated in the context.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. This statement is consistent with the principle stated in the context.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. This statement is consistent with the principle stated in the context, but the second sentence does not follow from the principle.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. This statement is consistent with the principle stated in the context.
  E: The principle stated in the context is not applicable to this statement.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other. An offer is not legitimate if it would be reasonably believed to be made in jest by someone in the position of the party to whom it was made.

A: This argument correctly states that a valid contract requires a legitimate offer and acceptance. However, it does not address the issue of whether an offer could be reasonably believed to be made in jest.
B: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above to argue that if an offer is made in jest, the contract is not valid.
C: This argument assumes that if an offer is legitimate, it must be accepted by the other party regardless of the circumstances. However, the principle stated above allows for the possibility that an offer could be illegitimate if it would be reasonably believed to be made in jest.
D: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above to argue that if an offer is made in such a way that it would not be reasonably believed to be made in jest, and the offer is accepted, a valid contract exists.
E: This argument incorrectly assumes that the only way an offer can be illegitimate is if it is made in jest. However, the principle stated above allows for the possibility that an offer could be illegitimate if it would be reasonably believed to be made in jest.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The principle stated above posits that a contract between two parties is legitimate only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

  B: This argument speaks of the situation where Gus made an offer to buy a shipment of goods but made the offer in jest. This situation is not a legitimate offer and thus not a valid contract.
  C: This argument speaks of Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business, but it does not address whether the offer was legitimate.
  D: This argument speaks to the legitimacy of Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea. If Lea accepts the offer and there was no reason to see the offer as a jest, then there is a valid contract.
  E: This argument only states that Sal made an offer that was not legitimate. It does not address the principle that legitimate offers must not be reasonably seen as jests. 

Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains that both kinds of horror stories (mad scientists' experiments and monstrous beasts) have two features in common: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  
  A: The passage only states that horror stories about monstrous beasts may symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. It does not state that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  
  B: The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and both are intended to produce dread in the reader. This statement is a generalization of those two features, so it could be true.
  
  C: The passage only mentions the psychological disturbance in protagonists in horror stories about monstrous beasts. It does not say that such characters are present in horror stories of any kind. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  
  D: The passage explains that horror stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. It does not suggest that most stories express the author's antiscientific views. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  
  E: The passage does not make any statements about stories that employ symbolism. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Horror stories about monstrous beasts can symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
- Horror stories about mad scientists express the idea that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
- Both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader.

Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. Therefore, if a story describes a violation of a law of nature, it would have to be intended to invoke dread in the reader, making statement B true. However, the passage does not provide evidence to support statements A, C, D, or E.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast.
  In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  Horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
  Both horror story types describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes two kinds of horror stories: those that involve mad scientists and those that involve monstrous beasts.
  Horror stories about monstrous beasts symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  Horror stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavors.
  Both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.

A: The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature, but it does not say that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature. Therefore, A cannot be true.
B: The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader, but it does not say that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader. Therefore, B cannot be true.
C: The passage states that horror stories about monstrous beasts symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, but it does not say that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed. Therefore, C cannot be true.
D: The passage states that horror stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavors, but it does not say that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views. Therefore, D cannot be true.
E: The passage does not talk about stories that employ symbolism. Therefore, E cannot be confirmed nor denied.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes two kinds of horror stories: those involving mad scientists and those involving monstrous beasts. Both kinds describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. In stories about monstrous beasts, the monster may symbolize a psychological disturbance, while horror stories about mad scientists may express the idea that scientific knowledge alone is not sufficient to guide human endeavor.

Reasoning:
  The question asks which statement must be true based on the information given in the passage. The passage discusses two kinds of horror stories, but does not make any broad statements about all horror stories or all stories that describe violations of the laws of nature. Instead, it focuses on the commonalities between the examples it provides. Therefore, options (A), (B), and (C) cannot be inferred from the passage. Option (D) is specifically contradicted by the passage, which suggests that horror stories about mad scientists may express concern about the limitations of scientific knowledge, but does not say that they necessarily represent the author's antiscientific views. Option (E), however, is consistent with the information provided in the passage, which suggests that stories that employ symbolism may also describe violations of the laws of nature.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast.
  In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  Horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
  Despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: According to the passage, both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. However, not all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature (choice A) and horror stories of any kind do not necessarily describe characters who are psychologically disturbed (choice C). The passage does not provide evidence for choice D. Finally, choice E is too broad and not necessarily related to the passage. Therefore, the only statement that would necessarily have to be true based on the passage is that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader (choice B).
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast.
  In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  Horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
  Both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.

Analysis:
  Option A is incorrect because the passage describes only some stories about monstrous beasts as violating laws of nature.
  Option B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that all stories that describe violations of laws of nature are intended to invoke dread.
  Option C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that characters in horror stories are usually psychologically disturbed.
  Option D is incorrect because the passage suggests only that some stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  Option E is correct because the passage suggests that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature, which is a feature shared by both kinds of horror stories described in the passage.

Action: Answer("E")

  Both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.

Analysis:
  A is too strong. The passage only states that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist; it does not say that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B is too strong. The passage states that horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader, but it does not say that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C is not supported by the passage. The passage only mentions that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist; it does not say that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D is not supported by the passage. The passage only states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor; it does not say that most of these stories express the author's antiscientific views.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: When surveyed about which party they would like to see in the legislature, 40 percent of respondents said Conservative, 20 percent said Moderate, and 40 percent said Liberal. If the survey results are reliable, we can conclude that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses premises about the actual state of affairs to draw a conclusion about how matters should be.
  B: The argument draws a conclusion that merely restates a premise presented in favor of it.
  C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  D: The argument fails to consider that the survey results might have been influenced by the political biases of the researchers who conducted the survey.
  E: The argument uses evidence that supports only rough estimates to draw a precisely quantified conclusion.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher claims that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. 
  
A: This choice indicates that the rate of jogging injuries was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries for both groups of joggers, but it does not impact the researcher's argument about stretching. So, this choice is not relevant here.
B: This choice suggests that the joggers who were previously injured had difficulty performing stretches. If stretching does help to prevent jogging injuries, then this could explain why the stretching joggers incurred injuries at a similar rate to the non-stretching joggers. So, this choice could weaken the medical researcher's argument.
C: This choice suggests that most jogging injuries are caused by factors that stretching would not impact. If this is true, then it could explain why the stretching joggers incurred injuries at a similar rate to the non-stretching joggers. So, this choice could weaken the medical researcher's argument.
D: This choice relates to habits of joggers and does not address the effectiveness of stretching before jogging. So, this choice is not relevant here.
E: This choice discusses the effectiveness of stretching before exercise in general, not just jogging. It also does not address the researcher's specific study. So, this choice is not relevant here.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Medical researcher compared a group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging.
  Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  The conclusion is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
A: This information does not provide any evidence that contradicts the medical researcher's conclusion.
B: This information suggests that stretching might have helped to prevent injuries in the group that did not stretch before jogging. Therefore, it weakens the medical researcher's argument.
C: This information suggests that stretching would not be effective to prevent most jogging injuries. Therefore, it reinforces the medical researcher's argument.
D: This information does not provide any evidence that contradicts the medical researcher's conclusion.
E: This information suggests that stretching might be effective to reduce the severity of injuries. However, it does not contradict the medical researcher's conclusion that stretching does not help to prevent injuries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries because both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  A: This statement provides a comparison between the two groups and the overall rate of jogging injuries, but it does not weaken the argument.
  B: If many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches, this could suggest that stretching is helpful in preventing injuries, but it does not provide any evidence to weaken the argument.
  C: This statement suggests that stretching may not help to prevent certain types of injuries, but it does not weaken the argument that stretching does not help to prevent injuries in general.
  D: This statement suggests that those who perform stretches before jogging are more prone to jogging injuries, which could weaken the argument that stretching does not help to prevent injuries.
  E: This statement provides evidence that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise, but it does not weaken the argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: Medical researchers compared two groups of joggers, one that stretches before jogging and one that does not stretch before jogging. Both groups experienced the same number of injuries. 
A: This information is not relevant to the medical researcher's argument.
B: If many of the joggers who were previously injured had difficulty performing stretches, then the lack of difference in injury rate between the two groups could be attributed to the fact that injured joggers in the stretching group were not able to perform stretches effectively.
C: If most jogging injuries result from mishaps on which flexibility from stretching would have little effect, then the medical researcher's conclusion that stretching does not prevent injuries would be strengthened.
D: This information is not relevant to the medical researcher's argument.
E: If stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries from certain forms of exercise, then the medical researcher's conclusion that stretching does not help prevent injuries when jogging would be weakened.
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher claims that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  A: This statement provides additional information, but does not directly weaken the argument.
  B: If many of the joggers who were previously injured had difficulty performing stretches, this could imply that stretching is not an effective injury prevention method.
  C: If most jogging injuries result from falls and collisions, stretching may not be helpful in preventing these injuries. This weakens the argument that stretching is not helpful in preventing injuries.
  D: The argument is about whether stretching before jogging helps prevent injuries, not about the habits of joggers who are prone to injuries.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries because both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  A: This choice provides additional information about the injury rate of joggers during the study, but it does not necessarily affect the comparison between joggers who stretch and those who do not.
  B: If the joggers who do not stretch are those who previously got injured while jogging, and they have difficulties performing stretches, then this could impact the comparison between the two groups.
  C: This choice provides information about the causes of jogging injuries, but it does not necessarily affect the comparison between joggers who stretch and those who do not.
  D: This choice provides information about the habits of joggers, but it does not necessarily affect the comparison between joggers who stretch and those who do not.
  E: This choice provides information about the effect of stretching on certain forms of exercise, but it does not necessarily affect the comparison between joggers who stretch and those who do not.

The two groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  A: This statement provides additional information, but it does not weaken the medical researcher's argument.
  B: This statement suggests that the group of joggers who stretched before jogging may have been at a disadvantage, and may have had a higher number of injuries if they had not experienced difficulty performing stretches. This weakens the medical researcher's argument by suggesting that stretching may have prevented injuries if it had been performed correctly.
  C: This statement suggests that stretching may not have prevented injuries in either group of joggers, which would support the medical researcher's argument.
  D: This statement provides additional information, but it does not weaken the medical researcher's argument.
  E: This statement provides information that is not relevant to the comparison made by the medical researcher.

Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, based on the fact that both groups of joggers (stretching and non-stretching) incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  A: This statement provides additional information about the rate of jogging injuries, but it does not directly affect the medical researcher's argument.
  B: This statement suggests that those previously injured while jogging would have difficulty performing stretches, which could mean that stretching is actually beneficial. This weakens the medical researcher's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that most jogging injuries are not related to flexibility, which would support the medical researcher's argument.
  D: This statement suggests that the habit of performing stretches before jogging is more common among joggers who are prone to injuries, which does not directly affect the medical researcher's argument.
  E: This statement suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from some forms of exercise, but it does not directly affect the medical researcher's argument about jogging injuries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries, based on a comparison between a group of joggers who stretch before jogging and a group who do not; both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  A: This statement, if true, would strengthen the medical researcher's argument.
  B: This statement suggests that at least one possible reason for the lack of a correlation between stretching and injury prevention could be that some joggers who have previously been injured while jogging may have difficulty performing stretches. Therefore, this statement weakens the researcher's argument.
  C: This statement, if true, suggests that the majority of jogging injuries occur due to factors that stretching cannot address, which would weaken the researcher's argument by suggesting that the comparison between joggers who stretch and those who do not may not be an accurate representation of injury prevention.
  D: This statement, if true, would not affect the researcher's argument as it does not address the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries.
  E: This statement, if true, would not affect the researcher's argument as it does not address the effectiveness of stretching before jogging in preventing injuries.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Whether or not one can rightfully call a person's faithfulness a virtue depends in part on the object of that personas faithfulness. Virtues are by definition praiseworthy, which is why no one considers resentment virtuous, even though it is in fact a kind of faithfulness-faithfulness to hatreds or animosities.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous.
  B: Virtuous behavior is praiseworthy by definition.
  C: Behavior that emerges from hatred or animosity cannot be called virtuous.
  D: Faithfulness and resentment are obviously different, despite some similarities.
  E: Resentment should not be considered a virtuous emotion.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses how faithfulness can sometimes be considered a virtue or not depending on the object of that faithfulness. The conclusion of the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous, so the answer is A. The other answer choices either do not accurately capture the main point of the argument or are too narrow in focus.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses the factors that determine whether faithfulness is virtuous or not. The conclusion is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Therefore, the correct answer is A. B is too broad and only partially captures the argument. C and E are too narrow, as the argument is not only about resentment, but also about faithfulness. D is not a conclusion of the argument, but a premise.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument is mainly discussing how the praiseworthiness of faithfulness depends on the object of that faithfulness. The argument provides an example of how resentment is not considered virtuous despite being a kind of faithfulness. Therefore, the conclusion drawn is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. This aligns with choice A. Choices B, C, D, and E are either too narrow or do not accurately reflect the overall conclusion drawn in the argument.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument states that whether a person's faithfulness is considered virtuous depends on the object of that faithfulness. The example of resentment being a kind of faithfulness to hatreds or animosities is given to support this claim. Thus, the overall conclusion is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. This is best expressed by choice A. Choice B is too narrow, as it only refers to virtuous behavior and not faithfulness specifically. Choice C is too extreme, as it suggests that behavior from hatred or animosity cannot be virtuous at all. Choice D is not directly related to the argument's main point. Choice E is similar to choice C in that it suggests that resentment is not virtuous, but it is not as comprehensive as choice A.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The passage presents the argument that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. It uses the example of resentment to illustrate this point. It also mentions that virtues are praiseworthy and that resentment is not virtuous, even though it is a kind of faithfulness. Therefore, choice A is the most accurate overall conclusion drawn in the argument. Choice B is mentioned, but it is not the overall conclusion. Choice C is too narrow in scope and does not capture the full argument. Choice D is not a conclusion but a statement of fact. Choice E is too specific and does not capture the full argument.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument concludes that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. This is supported by the premises that virtues are praiseworthy and that resentment, a type of faithfulness, is not virtuous. However, the argument does not make a sweeping statement such as "all virtuous behavior is praiseworthy" (B), nor does it say that faithfulness and resentment are "obviously different" (D). Finally, while the argument does suggest that resentment is not a virtuous emotion, it does not state that this is the only emotion that is not virtuous (E).
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses how whether faithfulness is virtuous or not depends in part on the object of that faithfulness. The conclusion is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous.  Choice A accurately expresses this conclusion. Choice B is a premise of the argument and not the overall conclusion. Choice C is a specific application of the overall conclusion and not the conclusion itself. Choice D is not a conclusion of the argument, but a premise; the argument does not make the claim that faithfulness and resentment are obviously different. Choice E is a premise that is used to illustrate the broader argument; it is not the overall conclusion of the argument.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument discusses the relationship between faithfulness and virtue, and how the object of faithfulness can determine whether it is praiseworthy or not. The conclusion of the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. This is best expressed in choice A. While the other choices touch on aspects of the argument, they do not accurately capture the overall conclusion of the argument.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses how faithfulness is not always considered a virtue, and how it depends on the object of the faithfulness. The conclusion of the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Therefore, the correct answer is A. The other answer choices are either too narrow or not directly related to the argument's conclusion.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument concludes that whether or not a person's faithfulness is virtuous depends partially on the object of that faithfulness. The argument supports this conclusion by contrasting faithfulness to praiseworthy objects with faithfulness to hatreds or animosities, which are not considered virtuous. Therefore, the best answer choice is A, which accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument.
